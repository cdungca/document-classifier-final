In the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Investing in the United  Nations: for a stronger Organization worldwide"" (A/60/846), it was recalled that the  General Assembly, in section I of its resolution 60/260, had requested proposals to  specifically define accountability as well as clear accountability mechanisms,  including to the Assembly, and to propose clear parameters for its application and  the instruments for its rigorous enforcement, without exception, at all levels. It was  also indicated that: (a) the Assembly had recently addressed the issue of  accountability in its resolution 60/254, in which it took note of the report of the  Secretary-General on measures to strengthen accountability at the United Nations  (A/60/312); and (b) accountability arrangements would be discussed further in  future reports, including those addressing human resources and the administration of  justice. It was further pointed out that the overall strategy of strengthening capacity  in the area of information and communication technology, exercising limited  discretion in budget implementation, enhancing financial management arrangements  and improving reporting mechanisms contributes to greater accountability through  improved transparency in management systems.   2.  Views have since been shared that it would be helpful if further attention were  paid at this time to accountability issues, including a definition of accountability, so  that related proposals regarding budget implementation, financial management and  reporting mechanisms might be considered against the background of accountability  concepts, frameworks and mechanisms. The present report has been prepared to  facilitate such consideration in connection with the above-mentioned report, and in  particular the addenda thereto (A/60/846/Add.1-4). It has been prepared in the full  knowledge that, while there exist a multitude of accountability mechanisms and  procedures, there is a widespread perception that those mechanisms and procedures  have been of limited effectiveness to date. They require systematic and equitable  enforcement if in future the accountability system is to become a useful driver of  programme efficiency. The impact of many of the recently instituted accountability  measures of 2005 and 2006 has yet to be felt, as such measures are implemented one  step at a time. Further steps are to follow upon the completion of ongoing studies of  governance and oversight, human resources and the administration of justice.        II. Definition      3.  The call for a definition of accountability follows the use of the term by the  General Assembly in several different ways, in a variety of contexts and under  various agenda items in recent years. While the most recent report submitted by the  Secretary-General on the subject (A/60/312) was issued under the agenda items on  financial reports and audited financial statements and reports of the Board of  Auditors, and review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial  functioning of the United Nations, some of the earlier discussions have also taken  place under the agenda items on human resources management and United Nations  reform: measures and proposals.  4.  These considerations of accountability date back more than 10 years and have  resulted in the issuance of a number of reports that have shown that the term  ""accountability"" has been applied to two distinct aspects of the same issue. It has  been applied, on the one hand, to the broad responsibility of the Secretary-General  A/60/846/Add.6      4  06-39477    to Member States for the use of resources and the delivery of programmes and  services (results) and, on the other hand, more narrowly, for the responsibility of  individual staff members to the Secretary-General for performance of duties and  ethical conduct. Any acceptable definition of the concept of accountability in the  United Nations context would, therefore, need to take into account both the  institutional and the personal aspects of accountability as currently understood in  the Organization.  5.  While the Assembly has requested a definition of accountability, it is  understood that the request is for a working definition that may be applied in the  context of arrangements existing under the United Nations Charter. Accordingly,  definitions available from academic or legal sources and textbooks would require  adaptation before they could be adopted for general use in the United Nations. In  fact, the best definition of institutional accountability in the United Nations will  reflect the concrete arrangements put in place, with the approval of Member States,  for a framework to specify how the Secretary-General is held responsible for the use  of resources and delivery of results. This is achieved by the operation of a set of  transparent mechanisms that define the chain of responsibility and authority  downward from the level of the Secretary-General to all individual staff members  and specify the related reporting mechanisms upward from the lowest level of staff  back to the Secretary-General and onward to the intergovernmental level (see  annex I).  6.  The definition of personal accountability will reflect the requirement for an  individual staff member to explain and justify to his or her superior the performance  of his or her defined duties and responsibilities and also to be answerable for his or  her conduct, whether good or bad.  7.  The General Assembly may therefore wish to consider adopting the following  accountability definitions:    (a)  Institutional accountability: the responsibility of the Secretary-General to  explain and justify to the General Assembly and other relevant intergovernmental  bodies, in a systematic framework and by an orderly process using transparent  mechanisms, the performance of the Organization in using resources to achieve  results mandated by the Member States in the Assembly and/or other  intergovernmental bodies established under the Charter of the United Nations;    (b)  Personal accountability: the duty of an individual staff member to  exercise defined responsibilities appropriately, with a clear understanding of the  consequences, and to explain and justify to the official who conferred the authority  the results achieved and the manner in which the authority has been exercised.        III. Chain of responsibility, authority and accountability      8.  As described in earlier reports on accountability, the chain of responsibility,  authority and accountability flows institutionally from the intergovernmental organs  to the Secretary-General and personally to managers and staff members. Under  Article 97 of the Charter, the Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of  the Organization; the mandates promulgated by the principal organs are entrusted to  him for their implementation under Article 98. The Secretary-General is therefore  accountable to the Member States for the implementation of those mandates. The    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  5    Secretary-General's discretion as chief administrative officer is governed by Articles  100 and 101 of the Charter and by the staff, financial and programme planning  regulations adopted by the General Assembly. His managerial discretion is exercised  under the mandates given to him collectively by Member States and with the  resources they make available to carry out those mandates. The responsibilities of  Member States are also specified in many of those legislative mandates and, where  specialized intergovernmental bodies are concerned, in their terms of reference.  9.  A comprehensive system of accountability is based on the premises that  responsibility must be clearly defined, managers and staff must have the resources,  capacity and authority to carry out their respective responsibilities, and  accountability must be established at all levels through appropriate mechanisms.  Such an accountability system has existed within the Organization for many years  and has been described, updated and discussed in a number of reports of the  Secretary-General, the most recent being his report on measures to strengthen  accountability at the United Nations (A/60/312). As is the case with most systems  and the related measures and processes for implementation, full compliance and  effectiveness require awareness, understanding, knowledge and timely application.  An important element of the accountability system is the reporting requirement  whereby Member States are kept informed of the management of the Organization's  programmes and financial and human resources. Such transparent reporting allows  Member States to provide policy direction, to review the status and effectiveness of  implementation, to consider the continuing validity of mandates and to take  decisions on future action to be taken by both Member States and the Secretary- General.  10. Recent enhancements to the accountability system within the Secretariat  include, for example, the implementation of results-based management; the  establishment of the Management Performance Board in 2005, the Ethics Office in  2006 and the Oversight Committee in 2005; enhancement of the Performance  Appraisal System; protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct in 2006;  the expanded and strengthened financial disclosure requirements in 2006; improved  performance data; and expansion of training for all levels of staff. Beyond the  Secretariat, the General Assembly, pursuant to its resolution 60/1, decided to  establish the Independent Audit Advisory Committee to assist it in discharging its  oversight responsibilities and, in its resolution 60/248, requested terms of reference  and related resource requirements. This is a key strategic change which, once fully  implemented, will greatly improve the quality of auditing as a core component of  the Assembly's oversight of the Organization. Such measures and others already  described in previous reports are intended to ensure that the legislative mandates are  implemented in the most effective and efficient manner.   11. Elements of an effective accountability system, summarizing earlier reports  and hereby updated, include:     (a)  A clearly defined institutional/governance framework. Such a framework  includes the Charter; legislative mandates (emanating from principal and subsidiary  bodies); and staff, financial and programme planning regulations and rules, policies  and procedures. In this connection, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/1,  the question of governance and oversight is currently being addressed by an  independent external evaluation, which will include measures to further strengthen  the governance and oversight framework, particularly with regard to the operation  A/60/846/Add.6      6  06-39477    of results-based management and related programme monitoring and evaluation  activities; the results of the evaluation will be transmitted by the Secretary-General  to the General Assembly. Within the institutional/governance framework, the  Secretary-General is institutionally accountable to Member States; all other staff  members are personally accountable to the Secretary-General;    (b)  A clear definition of responsibility and authority and results to be  achieved. This includes a determination of which staff members are responsible for  what, what they are meant to do and achieve and within what regulations and rules;  and clear objectives, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement. In  this connection, some of the recent measures effected in 2005 and 2006 include the  following:     (i)  Establishment of executive decision-making committees (see annex II);    (ii) A mandatory induction framework for senior managers;     (iii) An improved senior management compact;     (iv) An enhanced Performance Appraisal System;     (v)  Ethics training;     (vi) Access to information concerning decisions of the Secretary-General in  disciplinary matters;    (c)  Adequate resources and tools to implement mandates. This element of  the accountability system requires payment by Member States of assessments on  time, in full and without conditions; effective management tools (plans, budgets,  monitoring and evaluation); and effective human resources management;    (d)  Effective monitoring and oversight of programme, budgetary and staff  performance. The effective measurement of programme delivery and achievement  of results requires:    (i)  Effective oversight mechanisms (Management Performance Board,  Oversight Committee,  Office of Internal Oversight Services, Board of  Auditors, Joint Inspection Unit);    (ii) Effective internal controls (control environment, risk assessment, control  activities, information, communication and monitoring);    (iii) Improvements in monitoring and self-evaluation, including updating and  upgrading monitoring and evaluation tools;    (iv) Enhanced  accounting  standards,  as  proposed  in  document  A/60/846/Add.3, through the adoption of the International Public Sector  Accounting Standards;    (v)  Enhanced Performance Appraisal System;    (vi) Ensuring ethical conduct, financial disclosure and whistle-blower  protection;    (e)  Effective follow-up and clear, meaningful consequences. This element  requires effective measures and sanctions for dealing with non-compliance and with  poor performance, underperformance and non-performance. In this connection, the    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  7    administration of justice Redesign Panel will be submitting its recommendations to  the General Assembly at the sixty-first session.  12. In implementing the accountability system, the Secretary-General expresses  his accountability to Member States in reports submitted to them, as representatives  of the principal organs of the United Nations or as representatives of the subsidiary  intergovernmental bodies. Member States in turn exercise their oversight  responsibility for programme performance and take decisions thereon. Programme  managers are personally accountable to the Secretary-General, who exercises his  responsibility for ensuring programme monitoring and improving staff performance.        IV. Accountability for results       13. The work of the Organization is conducted pursuant to legislative mandates  adopted by the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social  Council and their subsidiary bodies. For the regular budget, those legislative  mandates are translated into programmes and subprogrammes, which are formulated  in accordance with the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the  Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the  Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8). The strategic framework serves as the  basis for the formulation of the biennial programme budgets. The Secretary-General  monitors the delivery of outputs and the achievement of expected accomplishments.  The Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning also provide that all  programmed activities shall be evaluated. With respect to peacekeeping operations,  the development, review, approval and administration of their budgets follow  similar results-based budgetary and implementation procedures.  14. The Secretary-General is thus institutionally accountable to Member States for  the proper management of the Organization and the implementation of its mandated  programmes and activities. The Secretary-General delegates authority to senior  officials who are, in turn, personally accountable to him. There are reporting  requirements throughout the cycle of planning, budgeting, implementation,  monitoring and evaluation of activities, and Member States have the opportunity to  hold the Secretary-General accountable for actions taken to implement legislative  mandates. Reporting requirements include status or progress reports on  implementation, programme and budget performance reports, specific reports  requested by intergovernmental bodies and evaluations of the work of the  Organization to determine relevance, efficiency and effectiveness. In this  connection, in addition to reporting requirements with respect to elements of the  programme planning cycle, the Management Performance Board and the Oversight  Committee, both of which were established in 2005, are expected to monitor the  manner in which senior managers exercise all aspects of the authority that has been  delegated to them with respect to programme management, including financial and  human resources management, and to report thereon to the Secretary-General (see  annex III).  15. Member States exercise their oversight responsibility by holding the Secretary- General accountable for the achievement of measurable results. This in turn requires  a management culture that focuses on attaining clearly articulated objectives  through the achievement of results. Good performance indicators are essential for  measuring whether or not the expected results were achieved. These elements are  A/60/846/Add.6      8  06-39477    fundamental for results-based management, the full implementation of which will  represent a significant step towards reaching the goal of accountability.   16. The challenges facing the Organization with respect to the effective  management of programmes include the enhancement of results-based management,  the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation activities and the improvement of  internal controls. Training and certification of acquired skills and knowledge are key  to ensuring more effective implementation of programmes.  17. It is noted that the programme evaluation system is separate and distinct from  the personnel performance appraisal system. Since the programme evaluation  system is concerned with programme effectiveness and impact rather than the  performance of individual staff members, no information shall be transmitted  between the two systems (Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning,  rule 107.3 (c)). At the same time, the Management Performance Board, in addition  to assessing the functioning of individual departments and offices and the manner in  which they discharge their responsibilities, will be holding senior managers  accountable should problems arise.         V. Accountability for management of financial resources      18. As mentioned above, there is a system in place, including regulations and  rules, for the planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of the Organization's  programmes and activities. Once the budgets are approved by the General Assembly,  authorization to incur expenditures is issued under the authority of the Controller in  the form of allotment advices, including staffing table authorizations. Various  administrative instructions set out the procedures and norms governing the different  items of expenditure. Extrabudgetary resources are subject to the same financial  management systems as those provided under assessed budgets.   19. The Financial Rules establish a clear and hierarchical structure in the  delegation of authority. The Secretary-General delegates authority and responsibility  for the implementation of the Financial Regulations and Rules to the Under- Secretary-General for Management, who in turn formally and publicly delegates this  authority to the Controller, except for the implementation of the Financial  Regulations pertaining to procurement and property management, which are  normally delegated to the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services.  The Controller and the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services  delegate some carefully defined aspects of their authority to the executive officers  of departments and to heads of administration in offices away from Headquarters.  Delegation of authority is done on a personal basis and not by virtue of the office  held by the staff member. Financial or procurement authority can be further  delegated by the executive officers or heads of administration, but the Controller  and the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services remain ultimately  accountable for its use. Delegation of authority is always done in writing and signed  by those to whom the authority has been delegated. In this connection, it is  recognized explicitly in the Financial Rules that accountability does not abrogate the  responsibility of those delegating authority. Exercise of delegated authority requires  the competency, knowledge and skills to ensure full compliance with the  instruments for internal controls. In this connection, greater attention will need to be  given in future to the timely issuance of guidelines, mandatory training and    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  9    certification of acquired knowledge and skills in order to strengthen accountability  for financial management.  20. The internal financial control systems of the Organization are based on the  concept of checks and balances, fundamental to which is the segregation of duties,  so that transactions require approval and scrutiny by more than one individual. The  internal control system entails the designation of staff with certifying or approving  authority; other staff are responsible for signing cheques, operating bank accounts  and effecting payments. The financial and staff regulations and rules contain explicit  provisions to protect the Organization against any financial loss that might result  from a staff member's violation of such rules. Financial rule 101.2 reads:    All United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the Financial  Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in  connection with those Regulations and Rules. Any staff member who  contravenes  the  Financial  Regulations  and  Rules  or  corresponding  administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and financially  liable for his or her actions.   In this connection, an administrative instruction was issued (ST/AI/2004/3) for the  purpose of implementing the provisions of financial rule 101.2 and staff rules 112.3,  212.2 and 312.2, detailing the conditions under which staff members may be  required to reimburse the United Nations either partially or in full for any financial  loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of the staff member's gross  negligence or of his or her having violated any regulation, rule or administrative  instruction.   21. During any financial period the Secretary-General's accountability to Member  States for the management of financial resources is reflected in the ongoing reports  Member States receive on financial and budgetary issues, including reports on the  financial situation, financial statements, audits, resource requirements, budget  performance, statements of programme budget implications and other reports as  requested by Member States, to facilitate their decision-making on the utilization  and prudent stewardship of the funds of the Organization. Financial and programme  adjustments are reported to Member States for approval.   22. Member States, through examination by the Office of Internal Oversight  Services of compliance with policies, also hold the Secretary-General accountable  for the safeguarding of assets, the economical and efficient use of resources and the  effectiveness of programme performance. Similarly, Member States, through the  work of the United Nations Board of Auditors, hold the Secretary-General  accountable for the quality and accuracy of the accounts of the United Nations.        VI. Accountability for management of human resources      23. Under the Charter, the Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of  the Organization (Article 97). He has the authority to appoint staff under regulations  established by the General Assembly (Article 101, para. 1). In the appointment of  staff and the determination of the conditions of service, the paramount consideration  is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and  integrity, with due regard paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a  geographical basis as possible (ibid., para. 3).  A/60/846/Add.6      10  06-39477    24. The authority to select staff under the Staff Regulations and Rules is delegated  to heads of departments and offices, who are accountable to the Secretary-General  for the manner in which they exercise that authority. Under the staff selection  system, which applies to staff appointed under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, the  authority is exercised under the scrutiny of a central review body, which will ensure  that the process leading to the decision was properly followed.  25. The authority to administer staff under the Staff Regulations and Rules is  delegated to senior officials who are personally accountable to the Secretary- General for the manner in which they exercise that authority. Those senior officials  may further delegate the exercise of elements of their own authority to other  officials, who will be answerable to them for the manner in which they performed  their functions.  26. Staff regulation 1.3 provides that staff members are accountable to the  Secretary-General for the proper discharge of their functions. Staff members are  required to uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in  the discharge of their functions, and their performance is appraised periodically to  ensure that the required standards of performance are met.   27. Department heads submit to the Secretary-General a senior management  compact, which includes, in addition to programmatic and financial objectives,  specific human resources objectives and targets agreed upon by the department head  and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management. The Office  of Human Resources Management is responsible for monitoring progress made  towards achievement of those objectives and targets. The Management Performance  Board is responsible for monitoring the manner in which senior managers exercise  all aspects of the authority that has been delegated to them, including their  performance in achieving the objectives contained in human resources action plans.  28. All other staff, up to and including those at the Assistant Secretary-General  level,1 are covered by the performance appraisal system (PAS). A key feature of  PAS is a clear definition at the beginning of the performance year by the staff  member and his or her supervisor of work objectives and associated performance  indicators. PAS has a midterm review and a year-end appraisal, at which point  performance is evaluated using the performance indicators defined at the beginning  of the year. Another key feature of PAS is that it assesses how staff demonstrate the  Organization's core values and competencies. All managers are evaluated against  the requisite managerial competencies.  29. Another important dimension of accountability is that all staff members,  regardless of level, are held to the basic obligations of proper conduct defined in  article 1 of the Staff Regulations and chapter 1 of the Staff Rules and are subject to  disciplinary measures when misconduct is established.   30. With respect to the accountability of the Secretary-General to Member States  for the management of human resources in the context of policies determined by the  General Assembly, reports on human resources management are submitted to the  Assembly on a regular basis for consideration, overall direction and decision- making. As requested by the Assembly in its resolution 60/260, further details on the  accountability mechanisms in respect of the Secretary-General's reform proposals  __________________    1  The governance and oversight evaluation is recommending that this be extended to the Under- Secretaries-General.    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  11    relating to human resources management will be submitted to the Assembly at its  sixty-first session in the context of a detailed report to be provided in respect of the  human resources aspects of the report of the Secretary-General on investing in the  United Nations: for a stronger Organization worldwide (A/60/692 and Corr.1).        VII. Accountability for management of procurement      31. The Secretary-General, in his report on procurement reform (A/60/846/Add.5),  has described concrete measures for implementing procurement reform focusing on  strengthening internal control measures, optimizing United Nations acquisition and  procurement management so as to reduce acquisition costs and strategic  management of United Nations procurement. These measures are aimed at  enhancing responsibility and accountability by promoting ethics and integrity in the  workplace (whistle-blower protection policy, training in ethics, Supplier Code of  Conduct, independent Bid Protest System), strengthening training programmes,  updating and/or modifying procurement processes (updated procurement manual,  improved terms and conditions for tenders, vendor roster, ex post facto cases) and  enhancing governance (risk management, contract compliance, oversight).  32. Delegation of authority, which does not abrogate the responsibility of the  official delegating the authority, for procurement activities needs to be closely  monitored. In this respect, authority is delegated formally to staff responsible for  procurement. The Secretariat will terminate such authority should serious flaws in  its exercise be discovered. At the same time, disciplinary measures are taken  wherever and whenever necessary based on established procedures currently in  place.  33. It should be noted that accountability for procurement activities does not rest  solely with procurement officers but also with requisitioners, who also need to be  fully trained and made aware of proper procurement practices. It is the  responsibility of requisitioners to have proper procurement plans so that actions for  the acquisition of goods and services can be taken on a timely basis and programme  results can be achieved in a cost-effective manner. The Secretariat has been  monitoring actions taken by requisitioners and continues to draw to their attention  instances where procurement procedures are not adhered to. For any serious breach  of conduct, disciplinary measures are taken, as appropriate.   34. The Secretariat continues to bring procurement staff at Headquarters and in the  field up to date on the concerns expressed by Members and by the auditors. In  addition to sharing knowledge and experience, there is a need to enhance training in  procurement-related activities throughout the Secretariat, which the Secretariat  plans to do. It is necessary to ensure that staff assigned to procurement activities  have the requisite knowledge and skills prior to assuming those responsibilities. In  this respect, the Secretariat ensures that new staff being recruited for procurement  functions have appropriate procurement experience and the necessary educational  background, preferably with certification in procurement. The Secretariat plans to  increase such procurement certification opportunities for current staff members as  well. Procurement staff assigned to field missions are technically cleared by the  Procurement Service prior to assignment.  35. One of the prerequisites for carrying out procurement activities in offices away  from Headquarters and in peacekeeping operations, outside the Procurement  A/60/846/Add.6      12  06-39477    Service, is the establishment of an adequate local capacity consisting of trained and  experienced officers. Once such capacity is fully established, procurement authority  may safely be delegated to offices and missions. Currently, the instrument of  delegation gives blanket authority to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations,  which is then further delegated to individual procurement officers in the field. This  procedure is under review to determine whether a more focused arrangement would  be preferable in future to provide for sounder internal controls on procurement.        VIII. Conclusions and recommendations      36. Starting with the Charter, which sets out the purposes and principles of the  United Nations, there are many instruments that guide the work of the Organization- legislative mandates, regulations and rules, policies and procedures, administrative  issuances, guidelines, instructions, oversight and review bodies, and performance  standards. In addition, there are reporting requirements of Member States to address  issues related to the management of programmes, procurement and financial and  human resources. While such instruments provide legitimacy for the conduct of  business, they also impose limitations on the way the Secretariat performs its duties.  With the increase in field operations, as well as their complexity, there is an urgent  need to find better ways to balance the timely implementation of Security Council  and General Assembly mandates and the fulfilment of all procedural requirements.  It is important to have effective controls, and it is equally important to encourage  greater initiative and innovation in order to manage better and in a more timely  manner. An appropriate balance between the overall policy guidance from Member  States and the exercise of managerial discretion by the Secretary-General is  essential for meeting today's multifaceted and complex challenges in a timely and  effective manner.   37. The assumption of responsibility, and being held accountable for the  performance of functions and duties, require an awareness, understanding and  knowledge of the nature and scope of the regulatory framework. It is essential that  staff are well equipped to ensure compliance within that framework. To that end the  Secretariat will not only enhance, and enforce where applicable, training  programmes, but will also require in future certification of knowledge and skills  acquired for the performance of functions in the areas of finance, procurement and  human resources management.   38. Accountability should be viewed not only from the perspective of possible  malfeasance, but also from the perspective of competencies for programme  performance. Little attention has been given, within the Secretariat or by  intergovernmental bodies, to holding the Secretariat accountable for the  achievement of results. In reviewing programmes of work, the focus has been too  much on the pre-implementation stage and, unless there are glaring errors, fraud or  corruption, which inevitably draw attention, little time is given to determining  whether or not results were achieved and, if not, why not. Measures exist to deal  with inappropriate behaviour, negligence, and gross negligence, and they need little  enhancement. Measures to determine the adequacy of results achieved, the  soundness of management of results, financial and human resources, and  procurement and subsequent action to hold staff accountable are probably  insufficient, however.    A/60/846/Add.6   06-39477  13    39. The General Assembly has repeatedly stressed the importance of strengthened  accountability and of ensuring greater accountability of the Secretary-General to  Member States for the efficient and effective implementation of legislative  mandates. Measures that have been put in place to ensure accountability for the  management of programmes and of financial and human resources have been  described in a number of reports over the past 10 years or so, the most recent being  the report of the Secretary-General on measures to strengthen accountability at the  United Nations (A/60/312). Follow-up action in implementing those measures has,  however, not been comprehensive. There is currently limited understanding of the  consequences of underperformance, poor performance, or non-performance. There  are currently no sanctions for the non-achievement of expected results. The  oversight of performance within the Secretariat rests on the shoulders of staff who  are appointed to sit on boards, panels and committees to undertake such reviews in  addition to their regular functions. It is not surprising that such oversight functions  are given lower priority when more urgent situations arise requiring immediate  attention.  40. A transparent and effective system of accountability and responsibility  demands more than setting out or revising procedures, regulations and rules. An  important element in the system is the continued promotion of a management  culture that encourages improved performance, higher levels of productivity and  better quality of work. Ethical behaviour and compliance with the standards of  conduct in the international civil service are required, as is an ongoing flow of  information within and among departments so that officials are fully aware, on a  continuing basis, of their respective responsibilities, particularly since coordination  and collaboration are essential for the implementation of many mandates.  41. As indicated above, details on accountability for human resources management  and in relation to results-based management will be addressed in the reports on  reform of human resources management and on governance and oversight  respectively, to be submitted to the General Assembly later this year.  42. The General Assembly may wish to:    (a)  Welcome the present report and endorse the definitions of  accountability provided in paragraph 7 above;    (b)  Note that a sound legal framework for accountability exists in the  United Nations, consisting of, inter alia:    (i)  The Charter;    (ii) The Financial Regulations and Rules;    (iii) The Staff Regulations and Rules;    (iv) The Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the  Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and  the Methods of Evaluation;    (v)  The rules of procedure of the General Assembly, which specify the  duties of the Secretary-General and of the Secretariat;    (vi) Procedures set out in regulations and rules, as well as in a substantial  number of General Assembly resolutions, which govern reporting by the  Secretary-General to the General Assembly on the use of financial and  A/60/846/Add.6      14  06-39477    human resources and on results-based programme implementation,  including monitoring and evaluation;    (vii) Procedures governing the reporting to the General Assembly by  oversight bodies, including the Board of Auditors and the Office of  Internal Oversight Services;    (c)  Note that the accountability framework of the United Nations has  been strengthened in 2005 and 2006 through:    (i)  The establishment of the Ethics Office and the provision of  systematic mandatory ethics training for staff;    (ii) Protection against harassment and retaliation for reporting  misconduct;    (iii) Strengthened financial disclosure requirements;    (iv) The establishment of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee;    (v)  The establishment of the Management Performance Board to hold  senior officials accountable for the conduct of their functions;    (vi) The establishment of the Oversight Committee to strengthen  compliance with approved audit and oversight recommendations;    (vii) The establishment of executive decision-making committees;    (d)  Note that further enhancements to the United Nations accountability  system may be anticipated in the light of recommendations expected from the  ongoing review of United Nations governance and oversight and of the internal  justice system;    (e)  Request the Secretary-General to continue strengthening the  effectiveness of the accountability system through:    (i)  Improvements in results-based budgeting and management;    (ii) Ensuring that sanctions in the accountability system are applied  through rigorous enforcement without exception at all levels;    (iii) Ensuring that adequate incentives are in place to reward good  performance.

"accountability","  United Nations    A/71/729      General Assembly    Distr.: General  21 December 2016    Original: English      16-22682 (E)    090117      *1622682*      Seventy-first session  Agenda item 133  Review of the efficiency of the administrative  and financial functioning of the United Nations           Sixth progress report on the accountability system in the  United Nations Secretariat         Report of the Secretary-General         Summary    The Secretary-General has the honour to transmit to the General Assembly a  report on progress made towards the implementation of the accountability system in  the United Nations Secretariat, as requested by the Assembly in its resolution 70/255.  The report highlights several critical components that have been strengthened over  the past year in areas related to internal controls, including: progress made in the  implementation of the enterprise risk management framework; the finalization of the  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat;  progress made in the implementation of a statement on internal control, in internal  controls in the procurement process and in accountability in field missions; and  improvements related to ethics and integrity and in the performance assessment of  the Secretariat's personnel. The report also describes how the major transformational  projects implemented in recent years continue to increase the visibility of crucial  information in the area of common support services, and how that can foster better  management and stronger accountability.              A/71/729      16-22682  2/23      I. Introduction      1.  The present progress report on accountability includes information on the  work undertaken by the Secretariat during the past year to strengthen areas related  to its system of internal control, as well as some of the additional actions in this  respect that need to be taken in the future. The system of internal control of the  United Nations is designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to adequate  resource utilization, the safeguarding of assets, reliable financial reporting and  compliance with relevant regulations, rules and policies. The report also explains  how some of the changes introduced by the major transformational initiatives, such  as increasing the visibility of the financial transactions of the Organization, are  fostering increased accountability and better management.  2.  In recent years, the United Nations Secretariat has successfully implemented  major change/business transformation initiatives, such as the International Public  Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), the global field support strategy, the  managed mobility system, Umoja and the capital master plan. Those initiatives,  while providing the opportunity to apply best management practices in various areas  of operation and to improve service delivery, have also introduced myriad changes  in the way the Organization works.  3.  For example, end-to-end process management is one of the most significant  changes brought about by the implementation of Umoja. It requires the Organization  to adopt a horizontal, cross-functional view of its administrative tasks in order to  fully achieve its objectives of improving productivity, lowering costs, reducing lead  times, increasing transparency and enhancing the quality of services. It is a new way  of working with increased specialization. It provides a major opportunity for the  consistent interpretation and application of all regulations, rules, policies and  principles related to the management of resources, increasing staff expertise in the  processing of transactions and reducing the number of errors.  4.  While prioritizing the full deployment and stabilization of Umoja in 2016, the  Secretariat recognized the existing linkages between the ongoing transformational  projects and the Organization's accountability structure as well as its system of  internal control.  5.  As mentioned above, the system of internal control of the United Nations is  designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to adequate resource  utilization, the safeguarding of assets, reliable financial reporting and compliance  with relevant regulations, rules and policies. Properly designed and functioning  controls reduce the likelihood that significant errors or wrongdoing will occur or  remain undetected.  6.  It is widely understood in the Secretariat that, following an intense period of  modernization and change, a series of tasks lie ahead in terms of change  management, ensuring accountability and strengthening the system of internal  control, and taking on such tasks will be a challenge. In that regard, it is worth  noting that the Secretariat continues to benefit from the observations and  recommendations of oversight bodies, particularly in respect of all completed and  ongoing transformational projects.        A/71/729    3/23  16-22682      II. Accountability and the strengthening of internal controls: a  continuous process       7.  As the objectives, standards and processes of the United Nations evolve over  time, strengthening its accountability system and the internal control framework  remains a continuous process for which there is neither a predetermined finish line  nor a set path to follow. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in recent  years towards that end, and at this juncture three important milestones are worth  noting.    (a)  Definition of accountability: at the sixty-fourth session of the General  Assembly, the Secretary-General submitted his report entitled ""Towards an  accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat"" (A/64/640). The Secretary- General's proposals submitted in that report led to the adoption of a definition of  accountability for the Secretariat by Member States. The definition included the  main components of the Secretariat's accountability system, and the decision of the  Assembly set a clear path for strengthening each of those components. The  Secretariat has since been reporting on the progress made towards that end through  its annual accountability reports;    (b)  Policy framework for enterprise risk management: a policy  framework for the implementation of enterprise risk management in the Secretariat  was approved by the Management Committee in May 2011 and submitted to the  General Assembly through the report of the Secretary-General on progress towards  an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat (A/66/692), issued in  2012. The Assembly, in its resolution 66/257, welcomed the progress made by the  Secretary-General towards the development of the enterprise risk management  framework. Subsequently, an enterprise risk management methodology and a  governance structure were established that allowed for the implementation of a  Secretariat-wide risk assessment. Action plans to mitigate the risks identified  through the assessment were developed and are being implemented, as explained in  the paragraphs below;    (c)  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations  Secretariat: a critical element of any accountability system is an anti-fraud and  anti-corruption framework, which was missing until recently. The Anti-Fraud and  Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat was issued in  September 2016 to reinforce the Organization's commitment to building an  anti-fraud culture and maintaining high ethical standards. The Framework guides  staff members on the proper methods for reacting to and handling cases of  presumptive fraud, and serves as a deterrent for those tempted by an opportunity to  commit fraud or engage in corrupt acts.        III. Progress made in strengthening internal controls      8.  Enterprise risk management focuses on the Organization's risks and is at the  core of the Secretariat's efforts to identify the main areas that require the  strengthening of internal controls. Enterprise risk management fully incorporates the  internal control system; it does not replace that system. It provides the Organization  A/71/729      16-22682  4/23    with an ability to move progressively towards risk-driven management, once the  appropriate internal control systems have been put in place.  9.  During the reporting period, actions were taken to strengthen accountability in  seven key areas of management, as illustrated in the figure below: (a) enterprise risk  management; (b) the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United  Nations Secretariat; (c) the statement on internal control; (d) internal controls in the  procurement process; (e) accountability and field missions; (f) ethical standards;  and (g) the performance of personnel. Progress made in each of these areas is  briefly described in the paragraphs below.        Seven key management areas              A/71/729    5/23  16-22682      A. Enterprise risk management       10. The Management Committee identified six critical organization-wide risks in  2015 requiring priority in terms of the development of related risk treatment plans:  (a) organizational structure and synchronization; (b) organizational transformation;  (c)  strategic  planning  and  budget  allocation;  (d)  safety  and  security;   (e) extrabudgetary funding and management; and (f) human resources strategy,  management and accountability. Those risks were presented to Member States in the  context of the fourth progress report of the Secretary-General on the accountability  system in the United Nations Secretariat (A/69/676). Subsequently, action plans for  mitigating them were developed and the implementation of the action plans was  assigned to the designated corporate risk owners. The progress made by the  Organization in mitigating these risks during the reporting period is detailed below.         Risk 1: Organizational structure and synchronization       (corporate risk owner: Deputy Secretary-General)    11.  Opportunities provided by the three peace and security reviews (peace  operations; peacebuilding; and women and peace and security), the World  Humanitarian Summit and the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development and other key agendas (the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk  Reduction 2015-2030, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International  Conference on Financing for Development and the Paris Agreement) continued to  be used to raise the awareness of Member States about areas in which the  Secretariat's structure might not be aligned with its objectives. Discussions on  making the United Nations development system fit for purpose, as well as the  identification of synergies, including a forthcoming review of agencies, funds and  programmes and a conflict prevention strategy, are under way.  12. Some actions were taken to reduce the existing ""silo mentality"" resulting from  the Secretariat's structure and to improve coordination, such as the refinement of the  2016/17 compact templates for senior managers at peacekeeping missions to better  reflect the multiple responsibilities of heads of offices.        Risk 2: Organizational transformation       (corporate risk owner: Under-Secretary-General for Management)     13. In respect of a vision and a target operating model for the Organization, the  framework for a global service delivery model was submitted to the General  Assembly at its seventieth session (see A/70/323). A refined and detailed proposal  of the Secretary-General in that regard was also submitted for the consideration of  the Assembly at its seventy-first session (see A/71/417). The benefit realization  plans for both Umoja and IPSAS are also moving forward as scheduled. On the  basis of the Organization's experience and lessons learned, general guidelines for  any new transformational project are also under preparation.  14. Additionally, in recognition of the interdependencies of the ongoing  transformational initiatives, a detailed common dashboard encompassing all of the  initiatives is regularly updated to ensure the integration of initiatives, the alignment  of key milestones and the recognition of synergies.    A/71/729      16-22682  6/23        Risk 3: Strategic planning and budget allocation       (corporate risk owner: Chef de Cabinet of the Secretary-General)     15. The proposed biennial programme plan for the period 2018-2019, submitted to  the Committee for Programme and Coordination, was based on an intense process of  internal consultations within the Secretariat. The revised programme plan reflects an  increased focus on results and impacts. For the first time, prior to its submission to  the General Assembly, the proposed budget outline for 2018-2019 was considered  by the Management Committee. The support account budget preparation process  was launched through a meeting chaired by the Chef de Cabinet with the heads of  all offices concerned. During these meetings, guidance on strategic priorities issued  by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support  was discussed. The progress made in the availability of increased financial  information to management for decision-making is described in section IV below.  16. Further progress in this area is linked to the implementation of Umoja  Extension 2, which covers the Secretariat programme planning, budgeting,  monitoring and reporting cycle. The first deployment of Extension 2 is planned for  August-September 2018, which would cover the peacekeeping budgets for 2019/20,  the programme budget for the biennium 2020-2021 and voluntary contribution  activities commencing in late 2018 or early 2019.        Risk 4: Safety and security       (corporate risk owner: Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security)    17. The strategic review of the Department of Safety and Security was completed  in 2015, and related recommendations are being implemented. The integration of the  security resources of the Secretariat is under way, along with enhanced  communication to the field and clear policy guidance on management, human  resources and finances. Progress was made in implementing the strategic priorities  of the Inter-Agency Security Management Network, such as the increased  integration of security management with programme delivery, and the support  provided to security decision makers on crisis management. Progress was also made  in institutionalizing programme criticality as a system-wide policy.  18. A draft occupational safety and health policy was completed in respect of duty  of care, and work is under way to establish an occupational safety and health  governance structure for the Secretariat.         Risk 5: Extrabudgetary funding and management      (corporate risk owner: Controller)    19. Preliminary guidelines for the preparation of agreements with donors and  implementing  partners,  including  those  related  to  restrictive  conditions  (e.g., immunities and privileges of the United Nations, a single audit principle,  procurement and recruitment), have been issued. A set of minimum required clauses  for each agreement have also been established, including those related to donor  reports, annual reporting, evaluations and contribution payment terms. Corporate  guidance on standard procedures for the selection of implementing partners,  clarifying the differences between the process of selecting implementing partners  and the procurement process and between implementing partnerships and grants, is    A/71/729    7/23  16-22682    being formulated in consultation with programme managers and the Office of Legal  Affairs. Revised policies for the establishment and management of trust funds and  relevant administrative instructions are under review by the Office.        Risk 6: Human resources strategy, management and accountability      (corporate risk owner: Assistant Secretary-General for Human  Resources Management)    20. The report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Overview of human resources  management reform: towards a global, dynamic, adaptable and engaged workforce  for the United Nations"" (A/71/323), containing proposals for an integrated human  resources strategy, was submitted for the consideration of the General Assembly at  its seventy-first session. Subject to the approval of the Assembly, a detailed human  resources strategy will be presented at its seventy-third session.  21. A global staff survey is expected to be conducted in April 2017 to assess staff  satisfaction and concerns and to create a benchmark against which future progress  can be measured. On the basis of the outcomes of the survey, high-level goals and  an organizational vision for the Secretariat will be articulated and supported by a  comprehensive human resources strategy.  22. For information related to the action plans for mitigating these risks, see annex I.        The way forward    23. While work on the critical risks should continue according to the agreed  multi-year plan, in order to serve as an effective managerial and strategic decision- making tool, the risk register should be maintained as a living document that would  represent the evolving risk profile of the Organization. The register should, in  particular, be able to formally capture emerging priorities through periodic, formal  assessments.  24. The updating of the Secretariat-wide enterprise risk assessment will start in  2017. This will provide an opportunity for further dedicated discussions with the  new Secretary-General and the new senior management team and for the definition  of an updated risk register.   25. To support the implementation of enterprise risk management at the  department and office levels, the Secretariat recently developed a practical  enterprise risk management guide for managers. The guide includes tools and  templates outlining how departments and offices can implement an effective  enterprise risk management framework based on common policy and methodology.  The guide was formally distributed to all heads of departments by the Under- Secretary-General for Management and was also made available on iSeek. A  consistent Organization-wide framework and approach is essential to ensure that  results across the Secretariat are comparable and can be consolidated and reported  to the Management Committee and governing bodies, as required. Progress  regarding the implementation of enterprise risk management at peacekeeping  missions is detailed in paragraphs 42-46 below.  26. The implementation of enterprise risk management continues to be supported  by a comprehensive communications programme, including an e-learning course  available to all staff in Inspira (the personnel management system) and, beginning in  A/71/729      16-22682  8/23    2016, also through the United Nations System Staff College. At the time of  reporting, more than 2,000 staff members were enrolled in the course. The  communications programme also includes formal and informal presentations,  training sessions and workshops in various departments and offices; enterprise risk  management and internal control web pages on iSeek; and the enterprise risk  management community of practice on Unite Connections, which includes more  than 200 practitioners virtually representing all the areas and entities throughout the  United Nations system and several other international institutions.        B. Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the  United Nations Secretariat      27. The Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations  Secretariat was issued on 15 September 2016. The Framework includes definitions  of fraud and corruption as they apply to the Secretariat, together with concrete  examples of cases most frequently found in the Organization. It also describes the  expectations and responsibilities with respect to the prevention of fraud and  corruption for each actor concerned, from the Secretary-General downward; the  fraud prevention measures in place in the Secretariat; and the principles guiding  third parties in contractual arrangements with the Secretariat, including vendors,  suppliers and implementing partners. In addition, it clearly reiterates the  Organization's zero-tolerance approach to fraudulent acts committed by Secretariat  staff members.  28. The Framework is the cornerstone of an enterprise-wide campaign being  carried out in coordination with the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the  Ethics Office. It includes the following activities:    (a)  The fourth Leadership Dialogue launched by the Executive Office of the  Secretary-General and the Ethics Office, on the topic ""Fraud awareness and  prevention: how do I fit in?"". The Dialogue is mandatory for all staff members at all  levels and was designed around the main issues included in the Framework;    (b)  An e-learning programme on anti-fraud efforts, entitled ""Preventing  fraud and corruption at the United Nations"" and planned by the Ethics Office in  coordination with the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the Office of Human  Resources Management. The course will be available to all staff starting in the first  quarter of 2017;    (c)  iSeek stories and anti-fraud pamphlets. The Department of Management,  through a story published on iSeek on 15 September 2016, reiterated that combating  fraud and corruption is a primary responsibility of management and staff at all  levels and requested all staff members to familiarize themselves with the contents of  the Framework. In addition, an anti-fraud pamphlet was distributed that emphasized  the zero-tolerance approach, the responsibility of the United Nations to protect the  anonymity of those reporting fraud, the obligation to report presumptive fraudulent  acts, where to report such cases and the disciplinary actions that the Secretariat  takes against staff involved in cases of fraud.   29. In addition, on 5 October 2016 the Secretary-General informed all staff  members in the Secretariat of the promulgation of the Framework and its purpose    A/71/729    9/23  16-22682    and requested them to make every effort to promote the highest ethical standards for  the United Nations.        The way forward    30. To comply with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 70/255, the  High-level Committee on Management has put together a task force whose main  objective is to work towards a single agreed definition across the United Nations  system of what constitutes fraud and suspected or presumptive fraud. The task  force, consisting of members from across the entire United Nations system and  co-chaired by the Director of the Accounts Division of the Office of Programme  Planning, Budget and Accounts of the Department of Management of the Secretariat  and the Controller and Director of the Division of Financial and Administrative  Management of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,  will also work towards developing a common understanding with a view to  establishing partnership arrangements with implementing partners. It started  meeting in September 2016.  31. As the Board of Auditors noted in its report on the United Nations (A/71/5  (Vol. I)), the legal framework in place for working with implementing partners in  the Secretariat does not flow from the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations. The Secretariat considers these relationships to be primarily substantive  and collaborative partnerships. In entering into such partnerships, the United  Nations may transfer financial resources to these entities when it is in its best  interest to leverage their capacity to implement activities that support or supplement  mandated activities. It is not a requisitioning/vendor type of relationship, which is  governed by the Financial Regulations and Rules and the Procurement Manual;  neither is it a grantor/grantee relationship in which the grantee is provided with  resources as aid or assistance to implement programmatic output that is consistent  with the Organization's mandate.  32. To face this challenge, the Secretariat will modify its Financial Rules to  encompass such activities. Further down the line, it must also define the framework  under which such relationships will be managed. This will be done through the  issuance of an administrative instruction that will specify, at a minimum, the  Secretariat's definition of ""implementing partner""; a process for selecting  implementing partners that ensures transparency and fairness with appropriate  oversight arrangements and includes due diligence mechanisms in the selection  process; basic clauses for the corresponding agreements; and United Nations  principles to which they should adhere (e.g., child protection and environmental  safeguards).  33. In addition, the Secretariat is at the early stages of planning for a high-level,  top-down Secretariat-wide fraud risk assessment, which will be coordinated by the  enterprise risk management function in collaboration with an outside expert. The  study, which is planned to be finalized by mid-2017, will be based on tailored  enterprise risk management techniques and aligned with the overall enterprise risk  management framework of the Organization. To ensure the full participation of all  functional areas of the United Nations, the Secretariat has put in place an advisory  committee that is co-chaired by representatives of the Office of the Under- Secretary-General for Management and the Office of the Controller.  A/71/729      16-22682  10/23    34. The completion of the anti-fraud risk assessment will contribute to the  assurance process underpinning the statement on internal control (see paras. 35-39  below), covering one of the underlying principles of an effective internal control  framework. It will also address the implementation of some of the recommendations  issued on this subject by the oversight bodies, including on the review and  rationalization of the current suite of policy and guidance material on fraud and  other misconduct; the establishment of a central intake mechanism for recording  staff grievances and suspected fraud; and the development of an integrated strategic  approach to tackling fraud.        C. Statement on internal control      35. As outlined in the ninth progress report of the Secretary-General on the  adoption of IPSAS by the United Nations (A/71/226), the Organization is pursuing  the introduction of a statement on internal control based on an organization-wide  assurance process.  36. While work continues on the development of the required deliverables and on  defining the future global assurance processes, as a first step and as an integral part  of these strengthening efforts, an Assurance and Monitoring Unit has been  established in the Accounts Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget  and Accounts. The Unit is responsible for undertaking activities aimed at providing  reasonable assurance over the reliability of data flowing into financial statements  and financial records. It regularly monitors transactions in Umoja, analyses  potential for error, detects irregularities and ensures appropriate corrective actions  by transaction owners or other stakeholders, as appropriate.  37. The roles assigned in Umoja are also reviewed periodically, which results in  recommendations to strengthen the segregation of duties, delegations of authority  and workflow rules in the system. An improved process flow will ensure that roles  requiring delegated authority are assigned in strict compliance with regulations and  rules of the Organization and in accordance with appropriate procedures.  38. In addition, the following actions will support the management of the  Framework: the provision of guidance to managers on using the planned self- assessment checklists and the correction of any future internal control deficiencies  found, and the preparation of monitoring dashboards to assess the performance of  client departments, offices and missions.  39. In addition, to strengthen accountability, track data integrity and support  compliance with related performance indicators, dashboards are being released for  individual departments, offices and missions depicting the status of their  transactions in terms of both monetary value and number of operations (including  errors) relative to the total volume of transactions during one year.         D. Internal controls in the procurement process      40. To enhance internal controls in the tender submission process, the  Procurement Division launched an e-tendering pilot project in 2014. The Division  continues to realize the benefits of e-tendering, which include the delivery of tender    A/71/729    11/23  16-22682    documents to invited vendors through their United Nations Global Marketplace  accounts; the efficient and secure transmission of tender questions, answers and  acknowledgements; and the Global Marketplace-integrated submission of offers by  the suppliers and the electronic opening of suppliers' submissions.   41. Annual self-evaluation and assessment reviews performed at Headquarters and  at the missions are yet another way to strengthen internal controls. Reports  containing recommendations aimed at enhancing adherence to the Financial  Regulations and Rules, the Procurement Manual and other administrative  instructions, and internationally recognized best practices in procurement, are  shared with administrative and functional heads. Since 2007, in addition to the  annual self-evaluation reviews conducted at Headquarters, a total of 71 assessment  reviews have been completed at peacekeeping missions. By strengthening the  internal control framework for procurement activities, the Organization mitigates  the risk and impact of inefficiencies, ethical violations and other improprieties.        E. Accountability and internal controls at peacekeeping missions         1.  Letters of representation     42. Directors and chiefs of mission support, as chief fiduciaries of peacekeeping  operations, continue to be required to submit letters of representation stating that  they have properly exercised the delegation of authority granted to them in  compliance with the Organization's regulations, rules and administrative issuances.  All letters of representation received from peacekeeping operations indicate that  chief fiduciaries have managed the resources placed under their stewardship in  compliance with the applicable United Nations regulations and rules.      2.  Conduct and discipline    43. Peacekeeping and special political missions continue their efforts to prevent  and respond to all forms of misconduct, in particular sexual exploitation and abuse,  by their personnel. This remains a high priority. Peacekeeping and special political  missions continue to implement the programme of action, which was initially set out  in the 2015 report of the Secretary-General on special measures for protection from  sexual exploitation and sexual abuse (A/69/779). Further augmented measures,  together with a series of initiatives, designed to strengthen prevention, enforcement  and assistance to victims were provided in the subsequent report of the Secretary- General on that topic (A/70/729). A number of these initiatives are aimed at  strengthening accountability at the individual, managerial/command and leadership  levels. A full update will be provided in the context of the next report of the  Secretary-General on special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and  sexual abuse, to be issued during the second resumed part of the seventy-first  session.  44. The Department of Field Support continues to monitor the implementation of  the policy on accountability for conduct and discipline in field missions, adopted by  the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and  the Department of Field Support in August 2015. The policy sets out the structure  that is in place to ensure accountability for the conduct and discipline of all  personnel serving at peacekeeping and special political missions. The policy is  A/71/729      16-22682  12/23    complemented by an accountability framework that details the methodology for the  assessment of the accountability of field missions and their senior managers, as well  as corresponding support to be provided by conduct and discipline personnel,  through a series of indicators and corresponding expectations concerning the  performance of activities related to prevention, enforcement and remediation.  45. At the beginning of 2016, electronic reporting templates were introduced for  the quarterly and annual reports submitted by peacekeeping missions as required  under the policy and accountability framework. Those templates include streamlined  and more targeted questions, allowing for the collection of more accurate data on  relevant indicators, which, once analysed, enable feedback to be provided to  peacekeeping missions on issues of concern and best practices identified in  connection with the indicators.  46. Annual quality assurance exercises, regular updating of the status of open  cases and the re-examination of possible reasons for delay or inaction have led to a  significant reduction in the number of reported cases of misconduct awaiting action.  In February 2016, the technical interface was activated between the Misconduct  Tracking System maintained by the Department of Field Support and the system  used by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for the deployment of military  and police contingent personnel, to allow vetting for prior misconduct against  information recorded in the System. With vetting now being done for military and  police contingent personnel, all personnel deployed at peacekeeping and special  political missions are now subject to the same vetting process, which is designed to  ensure that personnel previously found to have committed misconduct do not serve  again in the United Nations.      3.  Enterprise risk management at peacekeeping missions    47. During the past year, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the  Department of Field Support completed the first phase of the implementation of  enterprise risk management. During this phase, three peacekeeping missions (the  United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, the United Nations Mission in Liberia  and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo) and the United  Nations Global Service Centre initiated risk treatment plans to respond to the risks  identified in the risk registers. Implementation at the United Nations Support Office  in Somalia was delayed, owing to a change in mandate pursuant to Security Council  resolution 2245 (2015), for which an additional assessment was required to take into  account the revised mandate. The Departments also conducted the annual workshop  for mission risk management focal points at the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe,  Uganda, in April 2016. The workshop was attended by 29 participants from  peacekeeping operations, special political missions, the Global Service Centre and  the Regional Service Centre.  48. During 2017, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department  of Field Support will continue the phased implementation of enterprise risk  management,  with  emphasis  placed  on  missions  operating  in  high-risk  environments, particularly those in the start-up and transition phases. Both  Departments have taken measures to strengthen risk management capacities at  missions, including developing terms of reference for Risk Management Officers  and Compliance Officers and the mission enterprise risk management committee;    A/71/729    13/23  16-22682    establishing rosters for Risk Management Officers and Compliance Officers; and  advising peacekeeping operations to assess their risk management capacity and  submit a proposal for resource requirements for the financial period 2017/18.        F. Improving ethical standards      49. During the reporting period, the Ethics Office received more than 1,100  requests for services, which included 622 requests for confidential ethics advice, the  highest number ever recorded. The trend of growing numbers of requests by staff  members for advice on the Organization's ethical standards indicates their  commitment to ethics and integrity. Upon request, the Office also continued to  provide advice on due diligence, reputational risk and best practices in  anti-corruption programmes in procurement. The Office regularly assists in  establishing and implementing measures to enhance pre-appointment reviews of  senior positions for conflicts of interest. The Director of the Office continued to  conduct confidential ethics induction briefings for incoming and newly appointed  officials at the Assistant Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General levels.  50. For the 2015 confidential financial disclosure exercise, the external reviewers  identified and advised on 194 items of potential conflicts of interest. The review  was based on 5,440 staff members from participating agencies, with an overall  compliance rate of 99.9 per cent. In addition to meeting their confidential financial  disclosure requirements, 111 of 152 senior officials (73 per cent) participated in the  2015 voluntary public financial disclosure, compared with 103 of 151 (68 per cent)  in 2014.   51. In relation to requirements under the newly adopted IPSAS, the Ethics Office  provided significant support in developing relevant methodology for vetting key  management personnel of the Secretariat for conflicts of interest in respect of  related-party transactions. The Office completed vetting exercises pertaining to such  officials during two review cycles. The Office also completed preliminary reviews  of 23 claims of retaliation for protected activities and determined 6 of them to be  prima facie cases.        G. Improving the performance of personnel      52. The General Assembly, in its resolution 70/255, requested the Secretary- General to implement specific measures to strengthen the accountability system as it  relates to the performance of staff, emphasizing the performance of senior  managers.       1.  Senior managers' compacts    53. The senior managers' compacts detail -- in a clear, transparent and precise  manner -- the major areas of responsibility for senior leadership in the Secretariat,  in terms of both the unique programmatic responsibilities of each senior manager  and the standard managerial duties applicable to all of them. The responsibilities  described therein pertain to management at all levels and, ultimately, to staff and are  reflected in their annual workplans. Although it is subject to change by the incoming  A/71/729      16-22682  14/23    Secretary-General, the template for the 2016 compacts included the following areas  of responsibility:    (a)  Delivery of expected results towards the unique programme objectives  contained in the biennial programme budgets and, if relevant, the support account  and peacekeeping budgets;    (b)  Delivery of three to five high-priority results that are specific to each  senior manager and that help him or her to implement a programme or longer-term  objectives;    (c)  Implementation of the annual deliverables required by the multi-year  management reform agenda, which in 2016 fell into the following categories:    (i)  Deployment/consolidation/stabilization of Umoja;    (ii) Development of a global service delivery model;    (iii) Compliance with and sustainability of IPSAS;    (iv) Compliance with the information and communications technology  strategy, including its governance, policies and processes;    (v)  Requirements related to the launch of mobility;    (vi) Risk management;    (d)  Financial resources management;    (e)  Human resources management;    (f)  Implementation of oversight body recommendations;    (g)  Timely issuance of official documentation;    (h)  Compliance with regulations and rules;    (i)  Compliance with ethical standards.        Senior managers' compact for heads of mission    54. In response to a recommendation of the High-level Independent Panel on  Peace Operations, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department  of Field Support have refined the template of the 2016 senior managers' compact for  heads of mission to reflect their overall responsibilities. The refinements include:  (a) a new objective on gender mainstreaming, as requested by the Security Council  in its resolution 2242 (2015); (b) strengthened language on conduct and discipline to  reflect the introduction of the accountability framework on conduct and discipline  and the related reporting requirements; and (c) a new commitment in the area of the  environment to reflect the requirement to integrate and mainstream environmental  planning considerations into mission operations.        Compact assessments     55. Through  the  annual  compact  assessment  process,  the  Management  Performance Board identified compliance with recruitment timelines as a systemic  area of weakness for senior managers, and therefore asked the Office of Human  Resources Management to conduct a review of the recruitment process to identify    A/71/729    15/23  16-22682    bottlenecks. The Office found that manual screening and the often high numbers of  applicants were significant problems for hiring managers.   56. As a result of that finding, and as indicated in the report of the Secretary- General on the overview of human resources management reform (A/71/323), the  Secretary-General piloted a centrally administered assessment project with the goal  of reducing the recruitment timeline, in particular the time taken by hiring managers  to recommend candidates. As explained in paragraph 39 of the report, the project  entailed the introduction of an unproctored Internet-based preselection test for  eligible candidates for specific job openings within the Management and  Administration Network (MAGNET). As part of the project, the candidates screened  in by Inspira on the basis of eligibility requirements were invited to the preselection  test. Those candidates who passed the preselection test had their suitability screened  by hiring managers. Through that approach, the number of applicants who had to be  reviewed by hiring managers was reduced by 50 per cent before long- and shortlists  of candidates were established, and the time taken to recommend candidates was  thus cut down by a significant margin. Furthermore, as reported in paragraph 41 of  the report, the Secretary-General plans to expand the use of Internet-based  preselection tests, as their use has proved most effective when applied to job  openings that draw high numbers of applicants. This assessment approach is  currently being applied to the job openings within the new staff selection and  managed mobility system under administrative instruction ST/AI/2016/1.   57. Another systemic weakness identified through the annual compact assessment  process relates to the representation of women, in particular at senior levels. To  address this issue, the new 2030 gender equality and parity strategy, which is aimed  at achieving 50/50 gender representation in the Professional and higher categories  by 2030, requires a new methodology for determining gender targets in the senior  managers' compacts. Whereas the current methodology bases the annual customized  targets on each department's or office's performance in the previous cycle, the new  methodology will identify annual targets that clearly lead to 50/50 parity. The Office  of Human Resources Management will proactively provide data to departments and  offices that demonstrate opportunities for improvement, for example, by identifying  anticipated retirements.      2.  Performance management of staff at all levels     58. As detailed in paragraphs 77 to 95 of the recent report of the Secretary- General on the overview of human resources management reform (A/71/323), a  two-phased approach to reforming performance management is proposed. In that  approach, first the credibility and reliability of performance evaluations are  strengthened and, subsequently, performance becomes an explicit criterion that  determines the career progression of staff members and managers. In phase one,  which is expected to be implemented between 2017 and 2019, the Secretary-General  proposes to focus on three areas for improvement of the accuracy and credibility of  performance evaluations: (a) improving the ability of managers to manage  performance; (b) providing increased human resources expertise and support; and  (c) increasing the objectivity, transparency and consistency of the performance  management system (see A/71/323, para. 85).  A/71/729      16-22682  16/23    59. Phase two of the performance reforms would begin in 2019, involving the  revision of policies on performance management, staff selection and related areas to  explicitly include performance as a key criterion for lateral placement under  managed mobility and promotion of staff members and any performance incentives  recommended by the Assembly (see A/71/323, para. 95).  60. In support of those efforts, performance management data have been made  available to all departments, offices and missions through the publication of a pilot  end-of-cycle report, supported by the new performance management dashboard  launched in HR Insight in 2015. The end-of-cycle report is a mechanism by which  managers and staff can see overall trends in the Secretariat in terms of completion  rates and rating distribution. It highlights rating trends and patterns, by level and  entity. The aim of such transparency is to enable individual managers and staff, as  well as senior management teams, staff unions and others, to have real data and  foster more objective discussions on how ratings are given. Comparative data from  across the Secretariat will help to inform the discussions of senior managers and  provide guidance on how ratings may need to change in their own departments.  61. Additional efforts are focused on strengthening the role of senior management  with the roll-out of the organizational leadership model, which sets out clear  expectations for managers with regard to how to manage their staff, depending on  their roles in the Organization. Managers will be held accountable not only for  completing the e-performance document, but also for truly managing their staffs. The  Secretary-General is also ensuring that all incoming Assistant Secretaries-General  and Under-Secretaries-General are briefed on the importance of accountability for  effective performance management in their departments/offices/missions and of  complying with established timelines.  62. To support the implementation of the Performance Management and  Development System, the Secretary-General continued the roll-out of a more  targeted and streamlined version of the mandatory Performance Management and  Development  Learning  Programme  for  Managers  and  Supervisors  (see  ST/SGB/2011/5). Since January 2015, when the revised Programme was launched,  more than 3,000 staff members have been trained, 57 of whom have been Directors  and 18 of whom have been Assistant Secretaries-General and Under-Secretaries- General. The Programme reinforces best practices in performance management and  emphasizes the linkage between individual workplans and mandates of the  Organization, as well as the need to effectively address underperformance. The  Programme belongs to a suite of supervisory and managerial development  programmes that are aimed at, inter alia, increasing managerial accountability. In  order to ensure maximum accessibility and continuous learning, an e-learning  version for staff at large was launched in 2016.      3.  Taking corrective actions    63. As an internal check on managerial decision-making, the Management  Evaluation Unit has continued to conduct impartial and objective evaluations of  administrative decisions to assess whether they were made in accordance with the  relevant regulations and rules, and has made recommendations for remedies or the  initiation of accountability measures, where appropriate.     A/71/729    17/23  16-22682    64. The Management Evaluation Unit has also provided advice and guidance on  the relevant regulations, rules and jurisprudence, including through outreach  missions, video- or teleconferencing, participation in Office of Human Resources  Management training on performance management and the publication of lessons- learned guides. In 2016, the Unit published volumes 4 (performance management  and development) and 5 (managing organizational change (retrenchment,  restructuring, downsizing and abolition of posts)) of its lessons-learned guides.  65. In respect of the disciplinary measures handled by the Office of Human  Resources Management, from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016 a total of 67 disciplinary  actions were taken regarding 67 staff members in 63 incidents. The three largest  categories of incidents were related to fraud or misrepresentation (20 cases, or  30 per cent), theft or misappropriation (13 cases, or 19 per cent) and assault or  abusive conduct (10 cases, or 15 per cent).   66. Of the 20 staff members involved in cases of fraud or misrepresentation, 16  were either dismissed or separated from service and 4 were subjected to other  disciplinary measures (including demotion, loss of step(s), fine and censure). Of the  15 staff members involved in theft or misappropriation, 14 were either dismissed or  separated from service and 1 was subjected to other disciplinary measures. Of the 11  staff members facing charges of assault or abusive conduct, 10 were either  dismissed or separated from service and 1 was subjected to other disciplinary  measures.  67. For further details, see annex II.        IV. Increased financial information available for the  management of common support services        A. Budget and finance      68. Umoja Extension 1 has already brought about significant improvements in the  availability of information for better decision-making. It provides real-time  information on budget consumption and fund availability across entities and funding  sources, and, as a result, the Organization has a better view of its spending. The  forthcoming Umoja Extension 2 will include the cycle of programme planning,  budgeting, monitoring of programme implementation and reporting.   69. With regard to extrabudgetary resources, Umoja serves as a central repository  of all contribution agreements and permits the visibility of current and future  inflows. Umoja has strengthened compliance with donor agreements, improved  tracking of the performance of implementing partners, automated the allocation of  interest to grants and provided capability for improved management of programmes  and projects. Umoja has also allowed for improved tracking of implementing  partners; the Secretariat is now able to capture the agreements with its implementing  partners, which assists in monitoring their performance and settling financial  transactions.  70. Business intelligence reports have also been made available in Umoja to assist  departments and offices in monitoring their expenditures and planning their work  for a particular financial period. These reports cover, for example, budget  A/71/729      16-22682  18/23    performance and vacancies by leveraging information and data from Umoja and  Inspira to provide a picture of the financial situation of a given budget section. The  availability of ""obligation"" reports in the current system allows entities to monitor  open and closed commitments (obligations) during a financial period to ensure that  the committed funds are used during that period.  71. The financial statements module, which serves as the backbone for compliance  with IPSAS, was launched for peacekeeping operations in August 2016. The module  was designed to automate the preparation of financial statements using Umoja, to  replace a cumbersome process across several systems and multiple spreadsheets and  Word documents, and to reduce the possibility of errors. The module will be applied  to all other operations in January 2017.        B. Human resources      72. Umoja has brought about real-time visibility with respect to global personnel  data. It is now an important consolidated source of operational information  concerning human resources. HR Insight, which has provided staff demographic  information (including on desirable ranges, staff list by nationality and composition  by gender) to Member States since its introduction in 2011, continues to be  enhanced to meet evolving human resources needs.   73. HR Insight is also used to report on how the Organization is performing in  respect of the five strategic management indicators included in the human resources  management scorecard. This accountability and monitoring framework has been  designed to help managers achieve their human resources management objectives  with regard to a number of indicators, including the five strategic indicators, related  to gender equality, geographical representation, vacancy rates, staffing timeline and  performance management compliance. HR Insight also contains a number of  operational reports for specific business units, such as the Field Personnel Division  of the Department of Field Support, and on e-learning and performance  Management.  74. In addition, the Secretariat continues its practice of making available on iSeek  most senior managers' compacts and their corresponding assessments.        C. Central support services        1.  Real estate module in Umoja    75. The implementation of the Umoja real estate module has provided the  Secretariat with an accurate and comprehensive view of the owned, leased and  donated right-to-use real estate holdings of the Organization, across all duty stations  and field missions. The availability of centralized real estate data, with increased  visibility and access to real-time transactions, ensures better management and  improved decision-making in the area of real estate. It is now clear that the  Organization's real estate portfolio is managed by 65 entities with a footprint in 150  countries, consisting of 47,000 architectural objects, including some 5,800 buildings  and 1,890 sites. The management of these data in the Umoja real estate module  requires the use of common terminology, metrics, measures and contractual terms,    A/71/729    19/23  16-22682    which bring greater homogeneity to the related administrative processes and bring  the Organization closer to achieving the goal of ""one United Nations"".   76. In addition, lease administration is being carried out in a standardized manner  in all locations and there is full visibility of all cost recovery transactions. For  example, a single report generated through Umoja shows that in 2016 the United  Nations managed more than 1,200 active leases, including 311 lease-out contracts,  under which the United Nations is the landlord, with projected annual rental income  of $30,879,770.  77. The Umoja real estate management module also meets IPSAS requirements  with respect to disclosure, capitalization, depreciation and asset disposal. This is  achieved by tracking all United Nations assets using a centralized database and  managing an end-to-end process that ranges from the solicitation and bidding  exercise to the disposal of the asset at the end of its useful life.      2.  Travel management     78. An integrated global system provides for real-time analysis of travel  information and costs. Users and travel managers can better assess performance  through standardized key performance indicators, gain access to airline ticket prices  and itineraries, and see average costs per ticket, top routes and costs per transaction.  Users can monitor advance purchases of tickets, gain access to global price  information with respect to airline tickets, make more informed and cost-effective  decisions, and reduce delays in the processing of travel requisitions. Travel  regulations, rules and policies are embedded in the global system to support  compliance.      3.  Procurement    79. Umoja has allowed for the implementation of a global procurement operating  model in the Secretariat. Through master data management, 31,000 unique suppliers  for all Secretariat entities are currently consolidated in a common database. A global  commercial suppliers' database, combined with rigorous codification of the types of  goods and services procured by the Organization, reinforces transparency in  procurement. It also improves opportunities for negotiating more favourable terms  for the Organization. The Procurement Division has harmonized contracting  documentation (purchase orders and solicitation documentation) into a single form  used in all locations, and has created a global system that processes the workflow  regardless of locations and organizational units.  80. The procure-to-pay process introduced with Umoja has the potential to yield  discounts from vendors, such as prompt payment discounts with increased ability to  monitor the verification of goods and services, the certification of invoices and the  status of payments, in those cases in which the Organization has negotiated such  clauses with the vendors. However, the realization of such benefits will depend on  diligence in  receipt  and  inspection,  certification,  invoice-processing  and  disbursements on the part of the staff members responsible for those processes. In  addition, better contract management through the consolidation of some 3,200  systems and local contracts has the potential to prevent duplicative procurement.    A/71/729      16-22682  20/23      4.  Technology and data management    81. An important change introduced by Umoja is related to the retirement of  several legacy systems. In addition to savings in terms of hardware, software and  related human resources, the ensuing simplification of the information technology  systems and support landscape is facilitating the implementation of the information  and communications technology strategy. As additional business intelligence  capabilities are implemented, more benefits are anticipated as a result of better  aggregation of data and a reduction in the number of reporting databases.      5.  Global guidelines for the management of construction projects    82. In its resolution 69/262, the General Assembly requested the Secretary- General to ensure that best practices and lessons learned from the strategic capital  review were disseminated among duty stations. In response to that mandate, and to  ensure a consistent approach to all construction projects in the Secretariat, the  Department of Management developed global guidelines for the management of  construction projects. The guidelines highlight the roles and responsibilities of  various actors in successive phases of the construction process, with emphasis on  control mechanisms for projects, especially in terms of risk management and the  establishment and use of project contingency funds, among other matters.        V. Recommendations to the General Assembly      83. The General Assembly is requested to take note of the progress made by  the Secretariat in strengthening its accountability system, as described in the  present report.  84. The General Assembly is also requested to consider changing the  frequency of these progress reports from annual to biennial in order to provide  the Secretariat with more time to implement measures on which it reports.

It provides an indication of the principles that will  guide current and future management reform efforts.     From consultations I have undertaken since assuming office, I have clearly  heard that we are affected by slow, unresponsive service delivery; fragmentation in  management structures; micro-management by the governing bodies; a trust deficit  with Member States and with staff; inadequate resourcing of and ineffective  implementation of mandates; and a lack of transparency and accountability.    I am suggesting a new management paradigm that will empower managers to  determine how best to use their resources to support programme delivery and  mandate implementation. This will also mean transferring greater responsibility to  managers and holding them accountable for the programme and financial  performance of their programmes. It will not be a blanket delegation, but based on a  careful consideration of the capacities of managers to receive greater delegation of  authority and their abilities to properly execute it.    I am also suggesting a transformation of the Organization, based on sound  management principles, which will make the United Nations more nimble, effective,  A/72/492      17-16730  2/28    transparent, accountable, efficient, pragmatic and decentralized to better support its  normative and operational activities and will implement my ambitious reform  agenda.    I am making three main reform proposals in this regard. First, I am proposing  measures to streamline and improve the planning and budgeting processes. Budgets  should support better decision-making and better reflect the link between resource  use and programme delivery. Second, I am delegating managerial authority to  programme managers and demanding greater accountability from them for mandate  delivery. Third, I am proposing changes to the management and support structures to  better support delivery of programmes and provide managers with quality assurance  and strategic policy guidance.    The overarching objectives are to decentralize by bringing decision-making  closer to the point of delivery; trusting and empowering managers; ensuring greater  accountability and transparency; reducing duplicative structures and overlapping  mandates; increasing support for the field and reforming the planning and budgetary  processes.              A/72/492    3/28  17-16730      I. Introduction      1.  After more than 70 years, the United Nations remains more relevant than ever  to its mission: to deliver on its promise to save succeeding generations from the  scourge of war, reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, establish conditions  under which justice and respect for the obligations under international law can be  maintained, and promote social progress and better standards of life in larger  freedom. Peace and security, human rights, international law and development  remain the cornerstones of that mission.   2.  Through the United Nations, Member States have achieved significant  progress in the areas of peace, sustainable development and human rights. Yet, the  Organization has increasingly struggled to meet the objectives enshrined in the  Charter of the United Nations. The hard-won gains of the United Nations and its  Member States are fragile and at serious risk, including from a shift away from  multilateralism, in confronting the challenges faced by the world today in areas such  as climate change, population growth and displacement, the deepening of inequality,  poverty, human rights violations, increasingly entrenched and regionalized conflict,  and the growing threat of terrorism and violent extremism. Through experience, we  have learned that the failure to adapt or act results in the devastating cost of human  suffering and the tragedy of lost opportunity for global development and social  progress. I remain convinced that effective multilateralism and collective action by  the 193 States Members of the United Nations remain the world's best hope.  3.  To keep its promise to the people of today's world, the Organization must  re-examine how it functions, recognizing that substantive reforms in areas such as  peace and security and development must be underpinned by improvements in the  administrative functioning of the Organization. The management framework,  structures and procedures must enable and support a renewed vitality and innovation  across the Secretariat and the United Nations system as a whole to fully support the  fulfilment of the promise of the United Nations. We must enable unified action that  extends and best utilizes comparative advantages across the United Nations to  mutually reinforce the nexus of the work of the Organization in peace and security,  sustainable development, the protection of human rights and the preservation of a  healthy planet, while continuing to provide a valuable forum for intergovernmental  debate. We must act now, in all of those areas, if we are to fulfil what was  envisioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and leave no one  behind.  4.  The challenges to realizing the aims set out in the Charter are not, however,  exclusively external to the Organization. The Secretariat's centralized and  cumbersome management structure and administrative framework are not  sufficiently responsive to the growing number and scope of the mandates of the  United Nations, in particular in the field. Reform resulting in a different paradigm  that emphasizes an integrated approach and expedited delivery in the field is  critical. At a time when the overwhelming majority of United Nations personnel  serve in the field -- more than 90 per cent of civilian and uniformed personnel,  including two thirds of all civilian staff -- and most of the Organization's financial  resources are devoted to requirements in the field, the management framework must  be recalibrated to enable and support action in the field, where and when it is  needed. My reform proposal is aimed at bringing decision-making closer to the  point of delivery, simplifying rules, policies and procedures and decentralizing  authority to enhance the effectiveness of efforts. This requires institutionalizing  greater transparency and accountability in all activities to better serve the  intergovernmental and governance processes at Headquarters. In my reform  A/72/492      17-16730  4/28    proposal, I also propose the granting of greater managerial discretion in the  management and deployment of resources.  5.  With these thoughts in mind, in April, I established an internal review team to  examine what needs to be changed to make the Organization more effective and  responsive to those it serves. Through consultations with Member States and staff  members, at all levels, including heads of departments, regional commissions,  offices away from Headquarters and peacekeeping and special political missions,  the review team identified the following six key challenges:     (a)  Slow and unresponsive service delivery;     (b)  Fragmentation in management structures;     (c)  A weak performance management culture;     (d)  Gaps in resourcing of mandates and ineffective management of resources  for the implementation of mandates;     (e)  Gaps in transparency and accountability;    (f)  A trust deficit between Member States and the Secretariat.   6.  In concrete terms, I intend to deliver changes in those areas, by developing  proposals in four key areas. First, the leadership of the Organization must be  strengthened and empowered. Responsibility, authority and accountability must be  aligned and roles and responsibilities clarified. The focus of oversight mechanisms  must shift away from ex ante control to ex post facto compliance, matched by  accountability for results. Second, the Organization must become more transparent,  able to much more visibly and meaningfully demonstrate a clearer link between  resources and results, and must strengthen its risk management frameworks. Third,  to enable effective and timely action, authorities must be delegated, responsibly and  under clear conditions, so that they can be exercised closer to the point of delivery.  Fourth, the management structures at Headquarters must be reorganized to ensure  the accountable exercise of delegated authorities in support of effective and full  mandate delivery, including through the elimination of duplicative functions, the  establishment of a clearer division of roles and responsibilities and segregation of  duties, and the assurance of appropriate checks and balances.  7.  My vision for addressing the six key challenges rests upon two sets of  commitments into which I intend to enter, one with senior managers and one with  Member States. To senior managers, I pledge to give the full authority to deliver on  their mandates, as long as they do so transparently, responsibly and accountably.  From senior managers, I seek greater commitment to delivering reforms on the  ground and challenging the old ways of working. To Member States, I pledge that  the Secretariat will be transparent, responsible and accountable in its stewardship of  the resources of the Organization and in delivering upon agreed mandates and  benchmarks to ensure the implementation of all mandates. From Member States,  I seek their trust in the management of the Organization, allowing me the possibility  to take decisions that enhance the effectiveness of mandate implementation, within  the broad parameters outlined in the present report, without having to seek prior  approval for my actions.  8.  In addition, I propose the following major changes in the management of the  Organization:    (a)  Simplify and streamline the planning and budget cycle and reports,  including by moving from a biennial to an annual budget and shortening the  planning and budgetary cycle from five to three years. Programme planning and  performance information would be presented alongside financial information to    A/72/492    5/28  17-16730    improve the transparency of activities and support strategic decision-making.  I propose that Member States provide additional authority to redeploy resources  within the budget parts, not between them, thereby preserving the principle that  resources allocated for development should be used for development and those  allocated for the other pillars of the Organization should be used for those pillars.  I also propose that the scope of the commitment authority for ""unforeseen and  extraordinary expenses"" be broadened to respond rapidly to unforeseen events in the  areas of development and human rights;     (b)  Implement measures to increase the transparency of reporting to Member  States, including in monitoring, evaluation, programme and financial performance  and resource use;     (c)  Bring about an organizational change to eliminate duplicative internal  controls by establishing a Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance with a clear policy, strategy and compliance role and a Department of  Operational Support focused on operations, services, transactions and surge support  to entities in weak environments;     (d)  Take full advantage of Umoja and the global service delivery model to  carry out administrative transactions in a reduced number of locations. The United  Nations currently maintains functions, such as procurement and payment systems,  staff contracting, engineering and logistics management, in multiple locations.  I propose the consolidation of those functions into two or three centres and  undertaking a strategic assessment of the locations. This will be a complex exercise,  but it is urgently needed to ensure more cost-effective and consistent administrative  support. Improving supply chain management and enabling greater technological  innovations would also be critical;    (e)  Streamline and simplify human resources rules, processes and procedures  to ensure timely recruitment, deployment and staff development, with clear  delegation of authority to managers, together with clear rules of accountability.   9.  Throughout the process of reform, I will provide briefings to and consult with  staff as I firmly believe that staff are the most valuable asset of the Organization.  They deserve praise and support for their dedication and, in particular, their  personal sacrifices in the line of duty to the Organization, on the front lines of  conflict, in delivering humanitarian aid, protecting human rights, eradicating  poverty and leading the way along the path of sustainable development. I have met  with the representatives of staff, as well as staff at large around the world through  town hall meetings, and I intend to consult further as we move forward on the  detailed aspects of the implementation of management reform, in particular where  there may be an effect on staff welfare and conditions of service.  10. The management reforms set out herein are intended to strengthen delivery:  delivery at Headquarters, in support of multilateral deliberation and action and  setting and coordinating policy and strategic planning; delivery at the regional level,  in direct support of Governments, United Nations operations and other  intergovernmental and regional organizations; and delivery at the local level, where  our action most directly impacts the people we serve. The reforms take into account  the measures under way across the United Nations system to achieve more coherent  action with greater impact and build on the experience of past and ongoing  management reforms, taking advantage of previous investments made to strengthen  the Secretariat and enable unity of purpose and action in bringing fully to bear the  capacities of the Secretariat and, as appropriate, of the United Nations system. The  ultimate objective of the reforms is to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization  in meeting all its mandates and to enhance its accountability for results, while  complying with the parameters set out by Member States.  A/72/492      17-16730  6/28    11.  In this report, I set out in broad terms the concepts, purposes and principles  underpinning my reforms to the administrative functioning of the Organization, seek  the support of Member States in my vision for management reform, and identify  those areas where further work is necessary before detailed, costed proposals are  ready for submission to the General Assembly for its consideration. The  management reforms will be the principal enabler for efficient and effective  servicing of global operations, whether it be in development, peace and security, or  humanitarian response. They will cover the field, Headquarters, regional  commissions and offices away from Headquarters and will thereby allow the  Secretariat to address the needs of all areas, in particular the field, eliminate  duplication and enhance accountability through operational transformation and  appropriate delegation of authority. These reforms underpin the reform proposals in  development and peace and security.        II. Survey of previous and ongoing management   reform initiatives      12. Many attempts have been made over the years to address the challenges faced  by the Secretariat, to the extent that staff and Member States alike can be excused of  suffering from reform fatigue. Like my predecessors, I came into office recognizing  the need to build on and adjust prior reform initiatives to improve the administrative  functioning of the Organization. Modern management approaches have been  introduced with the development and/or implementation of the International Public  Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), the enterprise resource planning system,  Umoja, and the proposal for a new global service delivery model. They have also  included, most notably, the establishment of the Ethics Office, the Independent  Audit Advisory Committee, the enterprise risk management and internal control  framework methodology, the Secretariat-wide anti-fraud risk assessment, a new  information and communications technology strategy for the Secretariat, the  Department of Field Support and a series of human resources reforms, including  initiatives to promote managed mobility at different levels.   13. Yet, for all of the improvements achieved, much more remains to be done if  the Secretariat is to more effectively deliver on all its mandates. The Secretariat is a  complex organ that answers to many different intergovernmental bodies and pursues  many different goals and objectives. Over time, this has driven the staff of the  Secretariat to operate within silos, leading to conflicting or redundant activities and  an increasingly centralized, bureaucratic and risk-averse culture and leadership.  Administrative processes have become duplicative and slow to respond to the needs  of an Organization operating in increasingly dynamic, volatile and often dangerous  field-based environments.         Culture and leadership    14. If the United Nations is to truly lead, it must work across organizational  boundaries, harnessing the full power of its available resources, capacities and  partnerships. Critical to its success will be a profound transformation of culture, and  visionary and principled United Nations leadership -- at all levels and across the  system.   15. The United Nations must move to a culture that is focused more on results  than on processes, better manages administrative and mandate delivery risks, values  innovation, and demonstrates a higher tolerance for honest mistakes and a greater  readiness to take prompt corrective action. We must re-establish trust at all levels  and create a culture of empowerment and accountability, ensuring that leaders,    A/72/492    7/28  17-16730    managers and staff have the wherewithal to achieve, where, when and how needed,  and that the Organization is equipped and ready to support Member States as they  conduct their own work and take collective action. We must value and count on the  integrity and hard work of our staff, communicate openly what is expected of them,  recognize their performance against clear and fair standards, and ensure that staff  skills and competencies keep pace with the exponential rate of technological  innovation.   16. The reports entitled ""Investing in the United Nations: for a stronger  Organization worldwide"" (A/60/692 and Corr.1 and 2) and ""Investing in people""  (A/61/255 and Add.1 and Add.1/Corr.1) identified the need to better support and  develop the United Nations leadership and management culture. Some steps taken  towards that goal include the introduction of compacts between the Secretary- General and senior managers as a strategic management tool, dedicating capacity  within the Department of Field Support on senior appointments in field missions  and the development of induction and mentoring programmes, and mandatory  training programmes for senior leadership.   17. United in purpose, the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for  Coordination (CEB) endorsed the United Nations system leadership framework in  April 2017. The framework sets out eight defining characteristics determined to be  essential to fulfilling the Organization's core mandate to promote peace and  security, protect human rights, address humanitarian needs and advance the  imperatives of economic and social progress set out in the 2030 Agenda. The eight  principles defining United Nations leadership are that it is: (a) principled, defending  the Organization's values, norms and standards; (b) norm-based, grounded in  United Nations values and standards; (c) inclusive; (d) accountable, demonstrating  360-degree accountability within the United Nations, across the United Nations  system, to  Member  States and  to those  served by  the  Organization;  (e) multidimensional, integrating across organizational boundaries and functions;  (f) transformational, achieving positive change; (g) collaborative; and (h) self- applied, exhibiting the principles in all interactions. To these, I have added a ninth  characteristic: that it is pragmatic and action-oriented, taking principled and  practical action to deliver on mandates, balancing administrative and operational  risks and erring on the side of action to prevent and address human suffering.   18. I have instructed that the leadership framework be integrated into all  leadership and management staff selection decisions at all levels across the  Secretariat and that revitalized leadership orientation, training, mentoring and  coaching programmes be updated accordingly. In addition, I have decided that a  360-degree evaluation mechanism will be developed around the nine qualities and  that appropriate measurements will be included in the Secretary-General's senior  leadership compacts with heads of departments, offices, regional commissions and  missions. The Secretariat will conduct periodic staff surveys to monitor staff  perceptions of their leadership and managers, and I will introduce measures to  recognize excellent leaders and managers and to hold accountable those who fail to  uphold the principles and characteristics of United Nations leadership.   19. Leadership and management development programmes mandatory since 2009  for staff at the P-4 to D-2 levels and the competency-based framework for staff  selection introduced in 2010 will be adjusted to reflect the leadership framework  and will be more closely aligned with organizational expectations and performance  management. Performance management has become a significant management  challenge that impacts delivery and effectiveness. When confronted with  deficiencies in management, staff often believe that the only recourse available to  them is through the system of administration of justice. The desire to avoid the  internal justice system can lead managers to avoid formally documenting  A/72/492      17-16730  8/28    underperformance or to take administrative action against underperforming staff  members. Although such situations affect only a small fraction of the staff of the  Secretariat, the perception of impunity has a deleterious effect on the effectiveness  of the Organization as a whole and undermines the esprit de corps in the noble work  of the United Nations. Further steps to improve the performance management  system are also in progress, in the context of responding to the request made by the  General Assembly in its resolution 68/265, as set out below.        Simplifying human resources management    20. While success requires a fundamental shift in how the Organization is led and  how it conducts its work, it can be achieved only with full reliance on the dedication  and hard work of all staff at all levels. The diversity and complexity of the global  United Nations presence must be matched by a diverse, geographically balanced and  gender-balanced, international and multitalented workforce that is truly representative  of, and benefits, all the peoples we serve through a strong sense of duty and purpose  to uphold the values on which the United Nations was built and for which it stands.   21. Although originally designed with the fundamental purpose of ensuring the  fair treatment of staff and equal opportunities, inordinately complex human  resources policies and centralized processes not only contribute to delays in taking  action in identifying, deploying, administering and managing the Organization's  workforce, but, ironically, also serve to disperse and depersonalize decision-making  and thereby stymie transparency and dilute accountability in human resources  management decisions. The recruitment and separation of staff, in particular, are  pain points, characterized by ex ante controls and processes that do little to  contribute to the prompt and effective management of the workforce, but rather  place the Organization at risk of administrative litigation and failure to effectively  deliver mandates. While there clearly is a need to preserve the due process rights of  individual staff members, administrative processes have devolved to the point of  inertia, where, in practice, compliance with all procedural steps has come to matter  more than making the right decision and taking the correct action in the interests of  the Organization.   22. As organizational needs and culture shift, the Organization's workforce must  also shift to address the challenges of the present and those of the future. The  complexity and changing nature of global challenges demand streamlined and  simplified workforce planning and management, including performance management  and training, that ensure that the staff profile keeps pace with what the United  Nations is called upon to achieve at any given time and that the Secretariat is  managed with competence, integrity, efficiency, effectiveness in pragmatic action,  transparency and accountability. To serve and to serve well, the Organization must  capitalize on the diversity of its workforce and the direct experience gained through  geographical mobility, where functionally feasible.   23. Despite human resources reforms undertaken over the past decade, the  Organization is not as operational and effective as I would like it to be. It continues  to struggle with the challenge of getting the right people with the right skills at the  right place at the right time. As noted in a recent report on human resources  management reform (A/71/323), it takes 239 days on average to recruit staff in  non-field duty stations, a far cry from the 120-day target. This is too slow to allow  the Secretariat to respond rapidly to emerging needs. Furthermore, many human  resources processes are centralized, rigid and cumbersome, and policies are not  sufficiently adapted to the field and not always consistently applied. A fundamental  shift in mindset is required. The strategic human resources function in the  Secretariat must work to define a common vision for the Organization and align its  policies and frameworks with that common vision. It must focus on attracting,    A/72/492    9/28  17-16730    recruiting and retaining talent, including through measures to foster meaningful  career development and address staff health and well-being. Human resources  management must also more effectively address planning and reshaping of the  workforce. In short, the human resources function must ensure that the Organization  is able to retain and nurture staff with the skillsets and dynamism to meet new and  emerging challenges.   24. Meeting the principles set forth in Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter  must take concrete form not only by giving voice to the precepts that guide our  human resources policies, but also through a successful organizational renewal.  Human resources management policies must proactively contribute to greater  geographical and regional diversity of the workforce. It is unacceptable that, more  than two decades after the General Assembly, in its resolution 49/167 of  24 December 1994, urged the Secretary-General to implement fully the strategic  plan of action for the improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat (1995- 2000), the achievement of the goal of overall gender parity still remains elusive in  the Secretariat. I have stressed the importance of gender parity at all levels and have  instructed all senior officials to place it at the centre of their human resources  management priorities. In my senior appointments, I am committed to achieving  gender parity at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General levels  during my tenure and to ensuring greater geographical diversity among my senior  management team.   25. At the same time, there is a need to unite staff behind a common purpose and  to remember that every job at the United Nations, regardless of its place in the  hierarchy, is a unique chance for an individual to contribute to the wellness of  humankind. The Organization must re-energize the passion to serve the world.   26. In order to effect this transformation, the Organization must simplify its policy  framework and procedures and decentralize authority as close as possible to the  point of delivery, enabled by transparent and timely business intelligence reporting,  monitoring and quality assurance and measures for strengthened accountability.   27. The following issues need urgent attention and will be addressed in 2018,  taking into account the appropriate staff management consultations:    (a)  Review and simplify human resources policies and procedures, taking  into account best practices across the United Nations system and in other public and  private sector entities;    (b)  Improve workforce planning, paying specific attention to the profile of  leaders, managers and staff, to ensure quick and effective deployment as emerging  situations demand;     (c)  Strengthen measures to promote equitable geographical distribution and  gender parity;    (d)  Standardize and expedite job design and classification;     (e)  Improve the recruitment function and develop a human resources  dashboard to track key indicators, including on gender parity and geographical  distribution;     (f)  Take measures to speed up the screening of candidates, the verification  of their qualifications and job references and their onboarding;     (g)  Review the Secretariat's staff development policies, including mandatory  training, against the needs of the Organization, including consideration of industry  best practices regarding certification and recertification in certain fields;  A/72/492      17-16730  10/28      (h)  Refresh and align existing rosters and the Young Professionals  Programme across the United Nations system to facilitate inter-agency mobility  based on reciprocal agreements;     (i)  Produce an inventory of the skills of serving staff to enable their quick  deployment in the event of emergencies and reprofiling when needed;     (j)  Transform performance management, including introducing a 360-degree  evaluation mechanism, beginning at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant  Secretary-General levels;    (k)  Issue a downsizing policy;     (l)  Strengthen transparency and accountability mechanisms for the exercise  of delegated human resources management authority against established key  performance indicators.   Progress in all of these areas will be reported to the General Assembly at its  seventy-third session as part of a comprehensive human resources management  strategy.   28. Greater emphasis must be placed on investing in staff training and  development as part of a performance management system that will achieve the  required workforce shift in order to more effectively respond to present and future  requirements. Performance must be more effectively managed, including through  clear communication of expectations with staff members and measurement of  achievement against objective standards and updated competencies that are linked  to job design and standards across the Secretariat in order to align with the United  Nations system leadership framework endorsed by CEB.   29. Given the significant implications of the managed mobility framework on  those various streams and the need to explore alternative ways to incentivize  mobility, I am pausing the managed mobility programme so that the Organization  can benefit from lessons learned and prepare the comprehensive review requested  by the General Assembly in its resolution 68/265, which will be submitted to the  Assembly at its seventy-third session.         Streamlining programme planning, budget and finance    30. The continued strengthening of planning, budgeting and financial management  is critical to enhancing the performance and responsiveness of the United Nations.  Repositioning the management of the Organization for better delivery demands a  planning and budget process that is transparent and agile, accountable and  responsive, supportive of Member State action and decision-making and conducive  to pragmatic and effective Secretariat action.   31. The United Nations has demonstrated its ability over the past 70 years to adapt  to changes in the scope and breadth of mandates. The General Assembly has taken  action to adapt planning and budgeting tools in response to those changes. Plans and  budgets are governed by a tight regulatory framework, which includes extensive  reporting requirements, while oversight is exercised by the Committee for  Programme and Coordination and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and  Budgetary Questions, as well as the Board of Auditors. Plans and budgets must now  be geared towards results. The Organization's accounting system and the related  financial reporting standards have been brought into line with international best  practices through the implementation of IPSAS, thereby improving the link between  financial and programmatic accountability. The new enterprise resource management  system, Umoja, now offers the Organization the potential to decentralize, modernize    A/72/492    11/28  17-16730    and streamline processes, improve reporting and increase transparency in the use of  resources.  32. Nevertheless, enhancements to the existing planning and budgeting processes  are needed. The current cycle is protracted, with plans and budgets formulated well  in advance of the period to which they relate. Related documentation is voluminous,  labour-intensive and too fragmented to allow for a strategic, overarching assessment  of the Organization's programme of work. Furthermore, the process does not allow  for the reallocation of resources to respond to urgent requirements arising during  budget implementation. In addition, specific mechanisms need to be updated or  expanded to keep pace with current operational needs.  33. Planning and budgeting need to be instruments in the service of the  Organization's priorities and its programme of work. Accordingly, improved  programme plans must enable coordinated action to address challenges to peace and  security and the protection of human rights, respond quickly to humanitarian  imperatives and ensure that no one is left behind in achieving the Sustainable  Development Goals. The budget document must also become an instrument for  supporting the delegation of authority to managers to ensure greater ownership and  responsibility for programme planning and delivery. The results of programme  evaluations, self-evaluations and lessons learned would be reflected more clearly in  the new annual budget format to increase transparency in programme delivery.   34. The budget process must ensure that the resources entrusted to the Secretariat  are best allocated for the effective and efficient delivery of all mandates. Our new  technology tools must be used to increase transparency within the Secretariat and  towards Member States. For example, future extensions of Umoja should enable the  Secretariat to use dashboards to report on the utilization of resources and visualize  programme information.   35. While Member States have granted some managerial discretion to many heads  of specialized agencies, funds and programmes, the Secretary-General does not  currently have the managerial discretion to shift resources between programmes  during the course of budget implementation without the prior approval of Member  States. An experimental limited discretionary authority authorized by the General  Assembly in 2006 had a number of restrictive conditions that constrained the use of  that authority to effectively addressing emerging needs (see resolution 60/283).   36. I would propose a number of measures to improve my ability, as chief  administrative officer of the Organization, to manage the activities of the Secretariat  in support of the mandates set by Member States. In order to make the Organization  more responsive to the demands of a fast-changing world and in the interest of  making the best use of existing resources, I will propose a more simplified and  transparent mechanism to redeploy resources within the budget period. The new  managerial discretion would enable a more strategic use of approved resources  during the course of budget implementation. The resources allocated to the  Secretariat would be used more collaboratively within pillars to ensure the effective  implementation of programmes and mandates within those pillars. This would  support my efforts to reduce the silos and improve communication between  departments and pillars and ensure that departments work more collaboratively in a  common pursuit of the Organization's mandates.    37. These changes to the planning and budgetary process are crucial to my efforts  to reform the structures and change the management style of the Secretariat. They  embody my commitment to managers by increasing their ability to manage their  programmes and resources, while holding them accountable for the delivery of  results. Senior managers would be able to show more clearly the extent to which  they are able to implement their programmes with the resources allocated to them.  A/72/492      17-16730  12/28    The changes to the format of the budget report would enable Member States to  assess past performance, the lessons learned from improved evaluation and how  they were applied to subsequent programme planning and resource requests. It  would allow for a more focused and strategic dialogue with Member States on  programme delivery and resource allocation.  38. Specific enhancements to the planning and budgeting processes are  summarized in the table below, with further detail contained in the addendum to the  present report (A/72/492/Add.1). The General Assembly's prompt action at its  current session is sought on the proposals contained therein.        Summary of the Secretary-General's programme planning, budget and finance proposals    Current  Proposed      Planning and budgeting process      * Biennial programme budget    * Integrated annual programme budget    * Plan outline is part I of the strategic  framework prepared every two years    * Stand-alone plan outline report to cover a  period of 5 years  Changes to documentation and the presentation of results frameworks    * Programme performance report, budget  outline, biennial programme plan  (31 reports), proposed programme budget  (47 reports), special political mission  reports (10-16 reports), first and second  performance reports, report on transfers  between sections and financial statements    * Integrated annual programme budget  (44 reports) and financial statements     * Biennial programme plan    * Revisions to the results framework along  with a streamlined presentation and focus  on performance reporting    * Financial resources presented at  subprogramme level    * Aggregation of financial resources    * Special political mission budgets prepared  and submitted in September-October during  the main part of the session of the General  Assembly    * Integration of special political mission  budgets into the integrated annual  programme budget (create separate section  for special political missions that will be  included in the budget proposal prepared  and submitted in April)    * 14 budget parts and 36 sections structure    * 7 budget parts and 34 sections structure    * Statement V of the financial statements  contains high-level information on budget  variance by budget part    * Enhance statement V of the financial  statements with additional information on  the financial performance of the prior  budget period, including variance analyses,  information on redeployments undertaken  within the budget part and information on  the use of funds under ""unforeseen and  extraordinary expenses"" during the period     A/72/492    13/28  17-16730    Current  Proposed      Exceptional funding and operational arrangements    * Limited budgetary discretion     * Managerial discretion to redeploy resources  within budget parts    * Unforeseen and extraordinary expenses  under authority of the Secretary-General  only related to peace and security and the  safety and security of staff and premises    * Broadening of the mechanism for the  commitment of unforeseen and  extraordinary expenses     * Working Capital Fund level: $150 million    * Working Capital Fund level: $350 million          Information and communications technology    39. Over the past few decades, as the United Nations capitalized upon the  increased availability of information and communications technology to improve  programme delivery, a highly fragmented and inefficient landscape emerged. The  establishment of a revised information and communications technology strategy  in 2014 (see A/69/517) allowed the Secretariat to better leverage information  and communications technology as a strategic enabler, overcome technology  fragmentation and protect the Organization against the increasing risk of cybersecurity  threats.  40. Offering a single enterprise resource planning system to replace the hundreds  of disparate platforms used across the Secretariat, Umoja implementation has the  potential to empower managers and Member States with relevant business  intelligence tools providing information in real time, including strategic  performance metrics that will support not only executive decision-making, but also  systematic monitoring, quality assurance and support, and transparent accountability  mechanisms.  41. I intend that the Secretariat will refocus on the implementation of the  information and communications technology strategy. To that end, the strategic,  policy, governance and oversight role of the Chief Information Technology Officer  will focus on the development of Secretariat-wide information and communications  technology governance, strategy, policy and standards and effective enterprise data  management to support executive decision-making, quality assurance and the  monitoring of support and accountability mechanisms.   42. The strategy will continue to adapt to the diversity of functions within the  Secretariat. In a decentralized Secretariat, flexibility and agility are essential in  order to adapt and respond adequately to the speed of technological change and the  diversity of the demands of Member States and civil society, including  multilingualism across the Organization. With that in mind, an operational  information and communications technology function will deliver tailored solutions  to organizational units and provide day-to-day technical support to end users,  working within the information and communications technology framework. Client  engagement at both the strategic and operational levels will ensure that solutions  enable the United Nations to more effectively and accountably deliver on its  programmes and mandates and manage its staff.  43. In the implementation of the information and communications technology  strategy, it is necessary for the Organization to ensure flexibility, opportunity and  security, recognizing the different ""business models"" of the various entities in the  Secretariat, and move away from the one-size-fits-all approach. The digital  A/72/492      17-16730  14/28    revolution imposes an accelerated pace and a need for continual replacement of  equipment and platforms and enhancements of applications. Staff who regularly  interact with political, social and economic actors require prompt access to software  solutions and interactive platforms to facilitate the meeting of their programme  needs and the delivery of their mandates. Government and civil society decision  makers, as they adapt to the variety of demands of the digital economy, expect quick  solutions.        Improving supply chain management     44. Procurement in the Secretariat today is an extremely large and complex global  operation in which contracts worth more than $3 billion are managed on an annual  basis. While much has been done in recent years to align the Organization's  procurement practices with public sector best practices and make it more responsive  to field requirements, I am committed to further developing the procurement  function within the United Nations to make it even quicker and more client- oriented.   45. Procurement in the Secretariat has been marked by fragmentation, duplication,  inefficiency and onerous bureaucratic processes and controls. As an illustration, an  area to be streamlined is the process of establishing systems contracts, which  currently takes approximately 24 months and includes 40 distinct steps, during  which action passes between the requisitioning office and the procurement office at  17 handover points. Moreover, delivery of goods and services through an  established systems contract can still take upwards of 288 days. The implementation  of global supply chain management provides an opportunity to transform the  requisition, procurement, inventory and contract management functions. While the  principles of ""best value for money"", fairness, integrity and transparency, effective  international competition and safeguarding the interests of the United Nations will  continue to govern procurement in the United Nations, the roles and responsibilities  and processes associated with procurement must be streamlined and internal  controls must be redesigned and realigned to better manage risk to allow for greater  agility and faster response times while maintaining segregation of duties.   46. Eliminating duplication and integrating procurement into supply chain  management, while safeguarding its financial and commercial independence from  the requisition function, would reduce the overall timeline and ensure that the global  portfolio of systems contracts remains responsive to changing requirements. I intend  to implement a more nimble and agile procurement process in which decision- making authority is brought closer to the point of delivery. The process would be  accompanied by streamlined procedures and strengthened oversight using business  intelligence available through Umoja and IPSAS that empowers executive decision- making, along with centralized monitoring and compliance ensured under a  strengthened accountability framework.   47. Special care will be taken to ensure that, before further delegations of  authority proceed, policies are clear, processes are streamlined, those receiving  procurement delegations of authority are fully trained and supported, and business  intelligence and monitoring are in place to enable informed and responsible  executive decisions under fully transparent accountability mechanisms. Moreover,  to ensure that the Organization continues to benefit from the most cost-effective  purchase of goods and services, a judicious balance will be effected between the  centralized procurement of global requirements and systems contracts and the  further decentralization of procurement authority to empower mandate delivery. It is  to be expected that the bulk of high-value procurement, constituting more than  80 per cent of current procurement, will be conducted through central operational    A/72/492    15/28  17-16730    support resources, while low-value procurement will benefit from quicker decision- making at the point of delivery.        Enhancing accountability and transparency    48. The United Nations has in place an individual and institutional accountability  framework to promote compliance, transparency and the effective stewardship of  resources in the delivery of mandates. This framework is summarized in the formal  definition of accountability established by the General Assembly in its resolution  64/259 and comprises a number of elements, including a body of regulations and  rules governing the activities of the Secretariat, as well as a number of structures  intended to address different aspects of accountability within the Organization.   49. Those structures include independent external entities, such as the Board of  Auditors, established by the General Assembly in 1946 to audit the accounts of the  United Nations and issue findings and recommendations to the General Assembly;  the Joint Inspection Unit, initially established in 1966 to examine cross-cutting  issues to enhance the efficiency of the functioning of the United Nations system;  and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, established in 2005 to assist the  Assembly in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, including supervising the results  of the work of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), and on risk  management and internal control issues.  50. The internal oversight structures include the Office of Internal Oversight  Services, established in 1994 as an operationally independent entity whose main  role is to enhance internal oversight through internal audit, inspection and  evaluation, and investigation services. The Ethics Office was established in 2005, to  ensure that all staff members observe and perform their functions in accordance  with the highest standards of integrity.   51. In 2014, the Organization adopted the International Public Sector Accounting  Standards for its financial statements, which allows for greater access to, and  transparency in, information in order to facilitate better decision-making. IPSAS  provides comprehensive information on the financial position and performance of  the Organization, which allows Member States to assign accountability. The  information generated by IPSAS also allows for a closer and more complete match  of costs with mandates, objectives and results, thus improving the link between  financial and programmatic accountability.   52. As a single global solution for the Secretariat, the new enterprise resource  planning system, Umoja, will offer visibility in real time to detailed data on all the  administrative operations which are supported by the system irrespective of where  they are being conducted in the world. As indicated in paragraphs 91 to 93, Umoja  will be a key enabler of management reform.   53. Recognizing the importance of a systematic approach to the high-level risks  the Organization faces owing to the complexities of its operations and the ever- growing scope of its mandates, in 2016, an enterprise risk management and internal  control framework methodology was promulgated, a Secretariat-wide risk  assessment was implemented, and corporate risk owners were designated. This  provided the Organization with a defined mechanism to identify the top strategic  risks and to put in place relevant risk response strategies for strengthened internal  controls. The full implementation of enterprise risk management in all departments  and offices at Headquarters and in the field will be essential for reforms, including  the implementation of the first-ever Secretariat-wide anti-fraud risk assessment, and  these efforts will be further facilitated through comprehensive training.   A/72/492      17-16730  16/28    54. Still there are gaps that weaken the implementation of the framework, and  areas where implementation may compromise the aims of the system despite the  best of intentions.   55. The first area I intend to address is the strengthening of the culture of  accountability within the Secretariat. I am keenly aware that our accountability  mechanisms cannot bear fruit unless the concept of accountability is embedded in  the manner in which staff and managers conduct their day-to-day activities. This  requires staff at all levels not only to be aware of the existing accountability  framework and mechanisms but also to understand their personal accountabilities,  responsibilities and authorities. I have therefore requested that global management  accountability guidance be developed that clarifies for staff how the accountability  mechanisms all fit together and are interlinked, and that contains the  accountabilities for all functional levels in each job network. In addition, I intend to  request the heads of all departments, missions and offices to develop specific  personal accountability frameworks for their internal use. In turn, the personal  accountabilities would be reflected in our recruitment and selection system and our  performance management system, including the Secretary-General's compacts with  senior management.   56. The senior management team is aware of the importance I place on modelling  the behaviour we wish to see throughout the Organization, including transparency in  decision-making, recognizing achievements and taking action on unsatisfactory  behaviour. I further believe that some key elements of managerial responsibility and  accountability at all levels are:    (a)  Delivering the vital mandates entrusted to programme managers by  Member States;    (b)  Monitoring the implementation of the recommendations of oversight bodies;    (c)  Managing any risks which could prevent delivery of mandates (supported  by the enterprise risk management system);    (d)  Using resources allocated to programmes in the most effective manner;     (e)  Proving that the right results have been delivered cost-effectively (through  results-based management);     (f)  Evaluating how projects and processes operate, to continually improve  how the Secretariat functions (evaluation and continuous improvement).  57. An important part of these efforts will also include strengthening the  implementation of results-based management, redirecting the efforts of staff at all  levels towards the achievement of the Organization's objectives and goals, and  shifting the focus of the Secretariat's efforts from inputs and activities to results and  outcomes. These results will inform decision-making through the whole planning,  programme budgeting and evaluation cycle, and will become an important element  of the accountability and reporting systems of the Organization.  58. Next, I intend to focus on the second pillar of accountability -- transparency  in the functioning of the Organization and accountability to Member States. There is  already a substantial level of openness in what the Organization is doing and how it  is performing, as evidenced by the reports submitted to the General Assembly on  mandate delivery and the stewardship of financial and human resources. However,  this is not enough and we need to do more. I am therefore proposing that the  Secretariat include programme performance information and the lessons learned in  the proposed programme budget document. Programme planning information will  be more clearly linked to the Charter, the Sustainable Development Goals and the  legislative mandates guiding the programme of work of each department and office    A/72/492    17/28  17-16730    during the course of budget implementation. Programme planning and resourcing  will be better aligned to the lessons learned from past performance, which will  increase the accountability of programme managers for results. Improved  presentation as to how funds are utilized increases the chance that they will be used  more effectively for positive results and desired outcomes.   59. I intend to publish, soon after the appropriate Umoja extensions are in place,  comprehensive, real-time and easily accessible transaction-level information about  United Nations operations relating to the Sustainable Development Goals, using the  standards established by the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), which  aims to make all information about spending easily accessible. This will allow  Member States and the public at large to access and assess information as they wish.  This, in due course, will lead to the revision of our reporting standards to enable  publication in the IATI Registry on a monthly basis, including all related financial  and procurement transactions, encompassing all our activities around the world.  Implementation will begin with the publishing of a data set of limited scope by  1 July 2018, with a view to fully meeting the IATI standards as soon as possible  thereafter.   60. I am committed to leveraging Umoja to develop an online portal that would  present expenditure information in a more interactive and accessible manner. The  online hub would use maps and infographics to provide easily comprehensible  information about United Nations operations, for the benefit of our partners, the  public and the international community. The data would be updated on a daily basis,  subject to legal, security and other practical considerations. Programme  performance information would be reflected on dashboards to provide greater  transparency during the course of budget implementation. Results of self-evaluation  and lessons learned would be published online. The implementation of the  recommendations of oversight bodies would be tracked and reported to the General  Assembly on an annual basis.   61. Third, I intend to strengthen the self-evaluation capacity of the Secretariat to  better inform programme planning and reporting on programme performance.  Results of self-evaluation and evaluation will be used by programme managers to  better plan and adjust their activities. Information on self-evaluation, including  lessons learned, will be reflected in the annual programme budget to increase  transparency on programme delivery to Member States. Self-evaluation will be both  a learning tool and a management tool. It should provide further quality assurance  on programme delivery and be central to providing greater accountability and  transparency to Member States. The quality of the current evaluation functions and  outputs varies markedly across programmes. To address those shortcomings, I have  directed the Secretariat to formulate a policy that will provide independent  assurance on programme delivery. The policy will be based on the United Nations  Evaluation Group norms and standards for evaluation, which set out overall  objectives and basic principles of evaluation. Secretariat programmes with  functioning evaluation units will be requested to develop new policies or adapt their  existing ones within the framework of the new policy. A roster of qualified internal  and external evaluation experts will be created. A small central evaluation capacity  will be established to provide support to smaller units that do not have a meaningful  performance tracking and self-evaluation capacity. This support will include  drafting terms of reference for self-evaluation, providing quality assurance,  managing evaluations and the roster, and providing skills development. Evaluations  will be made available to all Member States; I believe that Members will greatly  benefit from them and provide valuable suggestions for continuous performance  improvement. Changing the format of the budget report will allow Member States to  have a clearer sense of the link between resources and mandates. Results of  A/72/492      17-16730  18/28    evaluations, self-evaluations and lessons learned will be reflected more clearly in  the planning for future budgets.  62. The implementation of my strategy to combat sexual exploitation and abuse  and our strengthened whistleblower policy will be greatly enhanced by our ability to  conduct robust and timely investigations. OIOS is an important partner in those  efforts. I encourage Member States to mandate an external review of the mandate  and capacity of the Office, focusing on its functions in the areas of auditing,  investigation and evaluation.   63. The fourth component I have prioritized is risk management, to ensure that  hidden and underlying risks are brought to the fore and properly addressed. The  current system of internal control focuses on mitigating risks of an administrative  and financial nature -- waste, fraud and abuse -- and does so mainly through  reliance on ex ante controls, including numerous decision points and fragmentation  of authority. While those controls provide a measure of confidence in the  responsible stewardship of resources, the narrow focus on compliance creates  onerous bureaucratic processes and significant delays in programme implementation  which may at times be undue, considering the potential risks involved, and may  serve to blur lines of responsibility and challenge efforts to ensure real  accountability, thereby resulting, ironically, in a perceived lack of transparency and  a trust deficit between the Secretariat and the Member States.  64. Ultimately, accountability measures must allow the Organization to  demonstrate to the Member States results in the implementation of all its mandates.  The budgets provide a critical tool through which the Secretariat can be held  accountable to the Member States, but we must do more to ensure that the budgeting  framework not only measures the utilization of funds and other resources but  measures rather the effectiveness of actions supported by those contributions. Our  risk management framework must, in other words, take into account factors such as  the devastating cost of human suffering, the impact of delays or failures in mandate  delivery, the safety and security of the Organization's staff and the accompanying  reputational risks. We must realign our risk management approach to incorporate  those risks and balance them more adequately with administrative risks, so that we  empower our leaders and managers to act and deliver -- responsibly and  accountably. I will establish a system of performance tracking and an evaluation  mechanism to alert me to areas of underperformance, and to enable the Secretariat  to intervene earlier to mitigate any risks to successful delivery.  65. The introduction of an enhanced and more balanced risk management  framework and results-focused approach to resource management will more clearly  illustrate the operational and strategic risks created by onerous ex ante bureaucratic  processes intended to reduce administrative and financial risk. To be clear, the  recognition and mitigation of operational and strategic risks does not require or  imply any relaxation of compliance with the regulations or rules, and there will be  strict accountability frameworks to ensure that this does not happen. But, where the  Organization faces considerable operational and strategic risks, a shift from ex ante  control to ex post facto accountability and a higher tolerance of administrative risk,  coupled with enhanced transparency and improved reporting to Member States, are  required to ensure that the limited resources available are put to the most effective  use in delivering and meeting the expectations of all those we serve.        III. Aligning authority with responsibility      66. Although previous reforms have served to improve the administrative  functioning of the Organization, a piecemeal approach and a culture characterized    A/72/492    19/28  17-16730    by mistrust and risk aversion have led to a central administrative framework  designed to exert ex ante control over the use and management of human resources,  finance and procurement. While perhaps appropriate when the vast majority of  Secretariat resources were deployed at Headquarters, a globally dispersed  Secretariat with responsibility for a wide range of activities, ranging from the  registration of treaties to conference management to the conduct of complex field  and emergency operations, requires a more dynamic and responsive approach to  accountable resource management if we are to deliver results to Member States and  vulnerable populations in a manner that recognizes the reality that has developed  over the past seven decades.   67. The Charter of the United Nations designates the Secretary-General as the  chief administrative officer of the United Nations. The Financial Regulations and  the Staff Regulations approved by the General Assembly outline the broad  principles and legislative directives under which the Secretary-General is to manage  the financial and human resources of the Organization. Under both sets of  regulations, the Secretary-General issues rules by which to implement the  regulations. In the context of the administrative framework of the United Nations,  ""authority"" refers to decision-making power in the management of financial and  human resources.   68. Under the Financial Rules and the Staff Rules, the Secretary-General delegates  the authority to administer the regulations and rules to the Under-Secretary-General  for Management, who may, in turn, further delegate authority to other officials.  Authority in such areas as human resources, procurement, property management and  finance is currently subdelegated to different officials for different situations via  different routes. In the regional commissions, for example, human resources  authority is delegated to the head of the human resources section (P-5), procurement  authority is delegated to the Chief of Administration (D-1) and financial authority is  delegated to the Chief of Programme Planning (D-1). Each receives the delegation  of authority in his or her personal capacity, bypassing the Executive Secretaries who  are normally advised by their subordinates about the policies directed by  Headquarters. Another example relates to peace operations, where, for example,  human resources management authority is delegated in full to the head of mission  through the Under-Secretary-General for Field Support. Procurement authority is  delegated to a director or chief of mission support through the Under-Secretary- General for Field Support, bypassing the head of mission. Financial authority is  delegated directly to the director or chief of mission support, bypassing both the  Under-Secretary-General for Field Support and the head of mission entirely.  69. In some cases the delegation of authority does not cover the full set of  authorities required for the execution of the function in question and/or authorities  are inconsistently delegated to different parts of the Secretariat, so that the back- and-forth required to manage resources is encumbered by heavy processes and  controls that serve to blur lines of accountability and delay action, and present  operational risks to mandate and programme delivery.  70. The current framework for delegation of authority results in two fundamental  managerial challenges for heads of departments, heads of regional commissions and  heads of missions. The first is complexity: delegations of authority are often issued  or rescinded through the sending of memorandums or faxes between departments or  missions, making it difficult for a manager to easily understand the extent of the  authorities available to him or her. The second is that authorities and responsibilities  are separated: while heads of department and heads of mission are responsible for  implementing programmes and mandates, they frequently lack the authority to  acquire and manage the financial, human and material resources to do so. Where  responsibilities have been transferred from one department to another, delegation of  A/72/492      17-16730  20/28    authority has not been accompanied by the resources required to exercise that  authority, or systems are lacking to ensure sufficient training, support, quality  assurance, performance tracking and evaluation. In other cases, particularly during  mission start-up, the staff required to exercise delegated authorities may not yet be  available.  71. Concerns with the functioning of the system of delegation of authority are not  new and have previously been recognized by the General Assembly in its  resolutions, such as resolutions 53/221 of 7 April 1999, 64/259 of 29 March 2010  and 71/314 of 19 July 2017. The incremental measures taken in the past to address  them have largely been ineffective, however, as reflected in an audit by OIOS of the  management of delegation of authority, 1 reports of the Board of Auditors 2 and  reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the delegation of authority.3,4  72. Addressing this longstanding issue requires, as a first step, review and  simplification of the existing regulatory framework. I have, therefore, requested a  comprehensive review to remove unclear, obsolete and duplicate policies and create  new, clear and simplified policies and administrative guidance over the coming year.  The result of this exercise will be the creation of an easily searchable policy  compendium, the mapping of delegations of authority and how they flow, and the  forming of a baseline of simplified processes and procedures that will allow all staff  and managers the ability to easily identify and understand an existing policy or  administrative issuance. The easier the administrative framework is to understand,  the more accountably and effectively it can be executed at all levels within the  Secretariat.   73. As a second step, I intend to address the fragmentation of delegation of  authority and the misalignment between authorities and responsibilities for  programme and mandate delivery. The current arrangement, where authorities are  fragmented and processes involve multiple points of handover between departments,  is neither transparent nor accountable. The most straightforward way to introduce  clarity in roles and responsibilities, segregate duties, eliminate unnecessarily  complex processes and strengthen accountability is to delegate authorities directly  to heads of departments, offices, regional commissions and missions, allowing  decisions concerning human, financial and physical resource management to be  made closer to the point of delivery. In areas such as human resources, I intend to  facilitate decentralized decision-making through delegating additional authority,  where it makes sense and where it is viable to do so, to programme managers,  including heads of departments, offices and missions. This will go hand in hand  with a robust accountability framework and proper guidance and support, so as to  allow for timely and responsible decisions by managers.   74. This approach ensures that the individuals who are accountable for the  implementation of programmes and mandates are actually empowered to effectively  deliver on those programmes and mandates, and that they can be clearly held to  account for how executive decisions are made against clearly set policies, standards,  values and benchmarks that will be transparently measured, monitored and  supported using reliable business intelligence provided in real time. This exercise of  delegated authority is not unconditional. In situations where the delegated authority  is not effectively or appropriately utilized or where it cannot be exercised, as in the  case of a small office or during the early stages of deployment of a new field  __________________    1  AH2007/510/01.    2  See A/70/322 and Corr.1 and 2.    3  See A/55/857 (JIU/REP/2000/6).    4  See A/59/631 (JIU/REP/2004/7).    A/72/492    21/28  17-16730    operation, the authority will be delegated elsewhere and exercised on behalf of the  entity.  75. It is my firm intent that the Secretariat will complete these two steps over the  course of 2018, during which time a judicious roll-out of increased delegation of  authority in human, financial and material resource acquisition and management  directly to heads of departments, offices, regional commissions and missions will be  effected, once I am assured that the requisite safeguards and accountability  mechanisms are in place.  76. Together, these two measures -- simplification and decentralization -- will  make delivery of programmes and mandates more effective and timely. Steps  towards this increased delegation of authority must be matched with increased  transparency and accountability, if we are to meet the crucial need to fulfil our  fiduciary responsibilities and build trust with stakeholders. Umoja will play a  critical role in ensuring visibility of data and needs to be fully implemented at all  levels using business intelligence provided in real time, and the Secretariat  accountability framework will be strengthened through clarity of roles and  responsibilities and the segregation of duties.        IV. Changing structures and organizational design for  strengthened accountability      77. The existing Secretariat structure is not effectively organized to allow for the  transparent and accountable exercise of greater delegated authorities. Two  departments -- the Department of Management and the Department of Field  Support -- are currently responsible for the bulk of the management of financial  and human resources within the Secretariat. However, the division of  responsibilities between the two departments is often unclear. Duplication of effort,  repetitive processes and dispersion of delegations of authority contribute to the  lengthy timelines required for critical business processes -- most noteworthy among  them, budget formulation and recruitment -- creating frustrations in both  departments, in missions and among Member States. Moreover, despite the  significant similarities in the administrative requirements of all Secretariat field  activities, for historical reasons the Department of Field Support supports only  peacekeeping missions, special political missions, and the African Union  peacekeeping operation, the African Union Mission in Somalia.   78.  To address these challenges, I am proposing a change in the organizational  design to reduce duplicative structures and overlapping mandates by separating policy  from operations and by establishing two different departments: one for policy and  compliance and the other to support operations. This will require the re-engineering of  the existing Departments of Management and Field Support. Both new departments  would support the whole of the Secretariat.  79. Existing organizational structures, delegations of authority and management  processes were examined against the following principles: unity of command and  purpose; clarity of roles and responsibilities; and empowered delegations of  authority that are rational, holistic and decentralized as far as possible within an  established risk framework, in which risk assessment is supported by analytics and  individual oversight data and the exercise of delegation of authority is supported,  monitored and designed so that form follows function. With these principles in  mind, I propose to replace the existing Department of Management and Department  of Field Support with two new departments, the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support, each  of which within its respective roles and responsibilities would support the entire  A/72/492      17-16730  22/28    Secretariat. While structural reform is not the objective, the elimination of  duplicative structures and the creation of two new departments, focused on policy  consistency and accountability and operational support effectiveness, respectively,  are necessary to ensure that enhanced delegation of authority to senior managers  translates into improved programme delivery, responsible stewardship of Member  State resources, and a more responsive and proactive United Nations.         Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance    80. The proposed Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance  would assume, on behalf of the entire Secretariat, the policy guidance, strategy,  planning and independent quality assurance functions currently exercised by the  Department of Management and the Department of Field Support. The new  Department would exercise these functions across the areas of budget and finance,  supply chain, human resources management and information and communications  technology. In the area of budget and finance, the Department would oversee  Secretariat-wide financial planning, budgeting and production of financial  statements. It would be responsible for the strategic and policy aspects of the supply  chain, including asset management and the procurement policies. In the area of  human resources management, the Department would be responsible for  organizational human resources management policy, and it would undertake  strategic workforce planning, organizational development, talent management and  staff development. With regard to information and communications technology, the  Department would be responsible for strategic functions, such as policy and  standards development, as well as oversight over the information and  communications technology architecture and application development.   81. The Department would include a dedicated compliance and risk management  function, and would leverage the global visibility of resources and administrative  processes afforded by Umoja to perform real-time monitoring, evaluations and  performance management of all finance, supply chain and procurement, information  and communications technology and human resources management activities across  the Secretariat. The Department would also be responsible for administrative law,  management evaluation and oversight of conduct and discipline for the entire  Secretariat, including a strengthened internal accountability function.   82. In addition, the Department would represent the Secretary-General on strategic  management and policy issues before intergovernmental governing bodies,  administrative advisory bodies and inter-agency coordination mechanisms. It would  monitor emerging management issues throughout the Secretariat and manage staff- management relations by ensuring the effective participation of staff in issues  relating to staff welfare, including conditions of work, general conditions of life and  other human resources policies.   83. Further, I intend to establish a Management Client Board, which would be  chaired jointly by the Head of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and the Head of the Department of Operational Support, and would  include rotating representatives for each of the different types of entity across the  global Secretariat, such as departments and offices at Headquarters, offices away  from Headquarters and regional commissions, peace operations and field-based  offices of special advisers and envoys. The Board would serve as a feedback  mechanism between the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and the Department of Operational Support and their clients. Where an  operational requirement is identified, the Board would feed into the policy-making  processes, including the development of field-specific policies, if required, as is the  practice in many of the funds and programmes which use Secretariat regulations and  rules.     A/72/492    23/28  17-16730        Department of Operational Support    84. The proposed Department of Operational Support would become the primary  operational arm of the Secretariat, assuming the operational and transactional  functions currently performed by the Department of Management, the Department  of Field Support, offices away from Headquarters, the regional commissions, the  Global Service Centre and the Regional Service Centre. The new Department would  exercise those functions in three broad areas: operational support, transactional  services, and surge, transition and special activities, with particular emphasis on the  requirements of all United Nations field activities, including peace operations,  delivery of humanitarian assistance and human rights monitoring, reporting and  investigation. The new Department would be responsible for operational and  transactional functions for and support to staff at Headquarters, offices away from  Headquarters, the regional commissions and the field.   85. Operational support would provide advisory capacities to senior managers and  staff in the exercise of their delegated authorities and for individual service needs;  administer information and communications technology applications, in compliance  with centralized established governance and guidelines; oversee supply chain  management operations, including the procurement of all goods and services that  would benefit from consolidated global planning, procurement and delivery; and  provide dedicated support to uniformed capabilities deployed to peace operations.   86. Transactional services would perform location-independent and administrative  tasks in areas such as human resources, finance and payroll, and in time other  corporate services, where it makes sense to consolidate and specialize, and would  also provide information and communications technology support to all  organizational entities within the Secretariat. In line with the global service delivery  model, those activities would be delivered by service centres offering support  24 hours a day, seven days a week, to leverage economies of scale and ensure the  consistent application of policies and procedures in meeting the requirements of all  organizational units across the Secretariat.   87. Surge, transition and special activities would be undertaken by a dedicated  capacity that would provide support for mission start-up, surges and transitions,  including for crisis response and humanitarian activities. Phases within mission  lifecycles such as start-up and liquidation have particular requirements that are most  effectively met by specialist teams with experience dealing with such requirements.  This pillar would also exercise delegated authorities on behalf of clients that lack  the capacity, temporarily or otherwise, to accountably execute delegated authorities  as determined by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance,  for example in the case of newly established missions or small field offices. The  delegation of authority, where circumstances so arise, may have to be withdrawn  and the decision to do so would be taken by the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance in consultation with the Department of Operational  Support.        Departments, offices, regional commissions and field missions    88. Under the proposed arrangement, heads of departments, offices, regional  commissions and field missions would directly receive delegated authority from the  Secretary-General for the management of financial, human and material resources.  They would continue to be fully empowered to formulate their budgets within  overall levels established by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance; to manage the funds appropriated by the General Assembly; to recruit  and manage their personnel; to ensure effective use of innovative technologies; and  A/72/492      17-16730  24/28    to procure required goods and services through established mechanisms and within  the appropriate guidance.   89. Senior managers would be supported in those functions through a ""business  partner"" function responsible for administrative advice and guidance; internal  compliance with the regulations and rules and organizational policies and  procedures; operational resource planning and management; and achievement of  benchmarks and goals specified in the accountability framework. The business  partner function would also serve as the interface between organizational units and  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the  Department of Operational Support. By being accountable for both resource  management and programme delivery, senior managers would be able to more  clearly demonstrate the relationship between resources and results, and to reflect  this in performance reports and other reports submitted to governing bodies.         V. Aligning ongoing reform initiatives      90. My vision for management reform of the Secretariat coincides with and  enables the ongoing implementation of a number of reforms authorized by the  General Assembly, such as the implementation of Umoja and the development of a  new global service delivery model. In fact, Umoja is a prerequisite for the enhanced  authority I intend to delegate to heads of departments, offices, regional commissions  and missions. Moreover, the establishment of a dedicated Department of  Operational Support builds upon the principles previously outlined in reports to the  General Assembly at the time of the establishment of the Department of Field  Support, and on the global field support strategy and the proposed global service  delivery model.         Umoja    91. Umoja is paving the way for more responsive and improved client services  through the standardization and harmonization of business processes within a single,  globally deployed system. The real-time visibility of global information facilitated  by Umoja should allow for more informed and timely executive decision-making  driven by business intelligence tools and the opportunity to modernize the internal  control framework of the Secretariat by combining greater delegation and  decentralization with improved accountability through increased transparency.  Umoja has not only opened the door to more efficient service delivery models, but  also serves as the impetus for the review of the existing administrative structures  that hinder the efficient use of resources and the effective delivery of programmes  and mandates. Embedded in Umoja access are clear roles and responsibilities for the  execution of transactional functions, representing yet another opportunity to support  the segregation of duties and establish a chain of accountability, when supported by  further simplification of policies and processes.  92. Umoja is gradually acquiring greater maturity in all locations. The  Organization has demonstrated its ability to adapt to new ways of working. This will  be leveraged and, through significant process re-engineering, strong process and  business ownership and robust change management, I expect to deliver the desired  qualitative benefits. A major software upgrade will also address one of the primary  complaints of Umoja, its user experience, and allow it to be accessed through  mobile devices. The enhancement of tools for senior managers, including business  intelligence offered in modular dashboards, will provide senior managers with the  relevant real-time information they need to effectively manage resources. This  functionality can be extended to Member States to allow them to visualize how    A/72/492    25/28  17-16730    resources are utilized, complementing the analysis provided in the regular reports to  the General Assembly.  93. The ninth progress report on Umoja will be submitted to the General Assembly  for its consideration during the main part of its seventy-second session and will  provide an update on the progress made in the past year, including in the  improvements made to Umoja Foundation and Extension 1, the development and  deployment of Umoja Extension 2 and the changes to the International Civil Service  Commission compensation package.         Global service delivery model    94. The global service delivery model is a key enabler of my reform agenda. The  Organization's current administrative framework is based on an intricate web of  procedures, often reflecting the constraints of a pre-Umoja past. The fragmentation  of administrative functions has resulted in divergent processes, inconsistent service  delivery and uneven client satisfaction across the Secretariat. Under the current  arrangements, accountability is diluted and effective oversight is impeded. The  global service delivery model is intended to address those challenges. Umoja  standardized and automated business processes across the Secretariat. The global  service delivery model will consolidate fragmented administrative structures within  and across duty stations, with the goal of improving service delivery through  simplified administrative policies, procedures and workflows to increase  responsiveness to operational requirements. It will also provide consolidated  administrative support capacity under a single management structure to allow for  greater consistency and scalability in service delivery, economies of scale and a  reduction of the Organization's footprint in higher-cost and higher-risk duty  stations.   95. The global service delivery model enables a Secretariat organizational  architecture that allows for greater clarity of roles and responsibilities, creates  proper checks and balances and ensures accountability for meeting client needs.  This allows for the consolidation of location-independent administrative functions  in shared service centres which would report to the Department of Operational  Support. Overall management policy formation, as well as monitoring, compliance  and quality control, would be performed by the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance. The separation of functions allows each of the two  new departments to focus on its respective area of responsibility, while ensuring that  both are mutually reinforcing and accountable components of the management  architecture for the entire Secretariat. The Management Client Board, co-chaired by  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the  Department of Operational Support, would concurrently serve as the client board for  the global service delivery model and ensure that policy development reflects  operational needs.   96. The shared service centres of the global service delivery model would report  to the Department of Operational Support, and the heads of the individual service  centres would report to the official responsible for transactional support services. To  ensure that shared service centres remain responsive to the needs of clients across  the Secretariat, their performance will be measured against key performance  indicators agreed and regularly reviewed by the Management Client Board. A client  relationship management platform is also critical for managing the interaction  between a service centre and its clients, including for tracking, reporting and  addressing issues raised by end users. An existing client relationship management  software application previously implemented by the Secretariat will be adopted for  the global service delivery model and expanded, including through the  A/72/492      17-16730  26/28    establishment of a common catalogue of services to meet the requirements of the  Secretariat-wide move to shared services.  97.  Some revisions to the global service delivery model, as originally presented, are  required to align with the proposed management architecture. The 2016 report to the  General Assembly on the global service delivery model (A/71/417) outlined a two- phase implementation road map, with an initial consolidation of functions into six  duty stations in 2018-2019 followed by a global consolidation of functions to two  shared service centres. Instead of this two-phase approach, I propose accelerating the  implementation of the global service delivery model and moving directly to two or  three shared service centres on 1 January 2019 as part of the establishment of the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of  Operational Support. This will allow the Organization to avoid unnecessary capital  and human resources investments related to the initial phase of consolidation. To  ensure a smooth transition, the business process re-engineering -- and the associated  adjustments required in administrative policies and in Umoja -- will be completed  and consultations held across the Secretariat in advance of the implementation date.   98. The incorporation of the global service delivery model into my management  reform programme ensures that it will be implemented in a manner that is fully  aligned with all other reform initiatives. Changes to the original proposal are  therefore necessary and, in line with General Assembly resolution 70/248, must be  approved by the General Assembly. A revised proposal for the global service  delivery model will therefore be presented early in 2018 in the context of the report  requested by the General Assembly in section XVII of its resolution 71/272, and  will include a detailed cost-benefit analysis as well as the proposed locations for the  shared service centres for endorsement by the General Assembly. The detailed  inventory of functional areas and processes performed across the Secretariat  requested by the General Assembly will be presented in the context of my next  report on management reform, to be submitted for consideration by the General  Assembly during the second part of its resumed seventy-second session, as part of  the information and analysis underpinning the proposed establishment of the two  new departments.         VI. The way forward      99. The present report presents my vision for addressing the fundamental issues  that undermine the ability of the Secretariat to meet the objectives set forth in the  Charter of the United Nations and the global challenges now before it. The measures  and proposals contained in this report are aimed at improving the effectiveness of  programme and mandate delivery and addressing the six key problems identified by  the internal review team. The proposed restructuring of the Secretariat to establish  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the  Department of Operational Support would facilitate the simplification, delegation  and decentralization required to permit delivery to occur in a more accountable and  transparent manner. I intend to revert to the General Assembly during the second  part of its resumed seventy-second session with a detailed proposal for  implementing this new management architecture for the Secretariat and other  measures requiring the approval of the General Assembly.  100. Addressing shortcomings in management culture and leadership is essential  for the success of management reform. As an initial step, therefore, I intend to fully  implement the United Nations common system framework for principled leadership  and to introduce 360-degree reviews, starting with senior management, to  strengthen the link between leadership and performance management.     A/72/492    27/28  17-16730    101. In the area of human resources management, and with the benefit of the  appropriate staff-management consultations, I intend to identify measures to  simplify procedures and reduce recruitment timelines, achieve gender parity,  strengthen performance management and improve capacity development. I propose  to reintroduce probationary appointments to enable the Organization to more  responsively evaluate the effectiveness of newly recruited staff. I also propose to  pause the implementation of the managed mobility framework in the light of  experience to date in order to permit a full review of its centralized processes and  their cost-effectiveness in meeting its intended purpose. I will revert to the General  Assembly with the results of this evaluation during the main part of the seventy- third session. In the interim, I also intend to work with the heads of the agencies,  funds and programmes to streamline and standardize processes, such as job design,  classification and reference checking across the organizations participating in the  United Nations common system, in order to increase inter-agency mobility and to  allow staff to enhance their skills, experience and value to the Organization,  enabling the organizations of the United Nations system to better work to their  comparative advantage.  102. To allow for decentralization and empowered human, financial and physical  resource management for programme and mandate delivery, the Secretariat will  proceed with a comprehensive review of existing policies and procedures to clarify  and streamline them. The Secretariat will also carefully examine the capacity to  effectively put in place holistic delegations of authority, making certain that all  required steps are taken to ensure that the training, support, monitoring and  accountability mechanisms are in place to support their judicious and effective roll- out over the course of the coming months until the end of 2018.  103. The Secretariat must strengthen the linkage between resources and results. In  the future, budgets will be better linked to indicators such as progress towards the  achievement of the targets under the Sustainable Development Goals, increased  acceptance of international norms and standards by Governments, improvements in  indicators such as the human development index and reduction of conflict in areas  of peacekeeping deployment. The United Nations should work with its many  partners and make use of the rich data sets that have become available in recent  years to develop more meaningful ways to measure results. These can form the  cornerstone of a new approach to the presentation of the programme budget, one by  which the time between budget formulation and execution is reduced and the  presentation of the budgets is better aligned with the activities set forth in the  Charter and more clearly linked to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  104. The real-time visibility afforded by Umoja will be used to enhance oversight  of procurement and supply chain management. Procurement will be integrated, with  appropriate safeguards, into the global supply chain, which will focus on satisfying  client requirements at the right place, at the right time and at the right cost, while  also assiduously ensuring the segregation of duties. It will also reflect a balanced  approach that recognizes that certain requirements can be most effectively sourced  and delivered globally while other requirements are most appropriately sourced  locally, thereby providing flexible and optimized solutions for clients across the  Secretariat.  105. Finally, I intend to significantly strengthen accountability by aligning  authority with responsibility, and by ensuring that the Organization accounts for and  mitigates the full range of risks that affect its activities, including administrative,  financial, operational and strategic risks. Where appropriate, the Organization  should rely on ex post facto review, as opposed to ex ante control, of delegated  holistic executive decision-making authority for human, financial and material  resources in the delivery of programmes and mandates to ensure accountability.  A/72/492      17-16730  28/28    Underpinned by performance monitoring, quality assurance and proactive support  guided and aided by information technology platforms that allow for greater  transparency in the use and management of resources, management accountability  will be overseen by a dedicated performance monitoring, quality assurance and risk  management function in the new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance.         VII. Change management      106. I fully appreciate that the transformational agenda outlined above will require  an exercise in change management perhaps as substantial as any that the  Organization has seen to date. To oversee the change, I have appointed the Chef de  Cabinet as the Project Sponsor on Change Management. The project will be led  jointly by the Under-Secretaries-General for Management and Field Support. The  Chef de Cabinet may appoint a project trustee to ensure full coordination in the  implementation of the management reform. The project will have a Governance  Board comprising an appropriate representation of department heads and business  owners. The project will be staffed by a dedicated team led by a project manager  and a group of team members on full-time release who will be selected from across  the Organization. External expert assistance on change management and project  management will be called upon selectively to ensure that the best practices are  being adopted in the process. The team will also work closely and engage regularly  with the change teams in other areas of reform.        VIII. Conclusion      107. The unprecedented challenges confronting the United Nations across the  spectrum of peace and security, humanitarian action and human rights protection  and sustainable development will not be met unless our Organization finds better  and stronger means of putting the full force of our capacities at the disposal of the  Member States, the international community, and the peoples we serve.  Management and administrative silos, antiquated and calcified business processes  and structures, and imbalanced risk management must be addressed if we are to lend  our full support to Member States and ensure our active engagement in preventing  and dealing with human suffering. In 2017, I have introduced a series of reform  initiatives designed to enable the Secretariat to deliver on the promises of the  Charter. Once more, I pledge my commitment and determination for the Secretariat  to do its part in their implementation.   108. The General Assembly is requested:    (a)  To take note of the report of the Secretary-General and endorse his  vision for management reform of the Secretariat;    (b)  To request the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly  at the second part of the resumed seventy-second session a comprehensive  report on the implementation of his management reform proposals;    (c)  To support the creation of the Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support, and to  request the Secretary-General, in the context of the above-mentioned  comprehensive report, to provide detailed information on the functions,  structure and staffing requirements of the new structure.

They included: slow,  unresponsive service delivery, fragmentation in management structures, inadequate  resourcing, ineffective mandate delivery and a lack of transparency and accountability.  In my report entitled ""Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations:  ensuring a better future for all"", I suggested a transformation of the Organization,  based on sound management principles, to make the United Nations more nimble,  effective, transparent, accountable, efficient, pragmatic and decentralized to better  support its normative and operational activities and indicated that I would implement  an ambitious reform agenda.     I suggested a new management paradigm that would empower managers to  determine how best to use their resources to support programme delivery and mandate  implementation. This will also mean transferring greater responsibility to managers  and holding them accountable for the programme and financial performance of their  programmes. It will not be a blanket delegation, but will be based on a careful  consideration of the capacities of managers to receive greater delegation of authority  and their abilities to properly execute it. Support to managers will be improved by  streamlining and simplifying the policy framework, providing clear guidance and  restructuring the current management and support departments to better support  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  2/246    delivery of all programmes and provide all managers with quality assurance and  strategic policy guidance.    On 24 December 2017, the General Assembly, in its resolution 72/266, welcomed  my commitment to improving the ability of the United Nations to deliver on its  mandates through management reform and indicated that it looked forward to  receiving a comprehensive report on my proposals. The present report contains my  proposals for reorganizing the current management structures at Headquarters to  enable and ensure the accountable exercise of delegated authorities in support of  effective and full mandate delivery, including through the elimination of duplicative  functions, the establishment of a clearer division of roles and responsibilities and  segregation of duties, and the assurance of appropriate checks and balances. The  reorganization will lead to the creation of a Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance with a clear policy, strategy and compliance role and a  Department of Operational Support focused on operations, services, transactions and  surge support to entities in weak environments. Both departments will service and  support the entire Secretariat -- at Headquarters, the regional commissions and offices  away from Headquarters and in the field.    Reform processes, by their very nature, tend to focus largely on measures to  improve the current system. It is also important, however, to celebrate our many  achievements and to recognize that reform has been an ongoing process. My reforms  will build on the achievements of past and ongoing reform efforts, as well as the  lessons learned from their implementation.     I wish to pay tribute to the tens of thousands of men and women who serve the  Organization with pride and dedication, often in very difficult and dangerous  environments. Our reform efforts are aimed at helping them to perform their tasks with  greater ease and with fewer bureaucratic impediments.

Introduction       1.  As our world witnesses a global landscape devastated by human suffering  through conflict, humanitarian crises, human rights abuses, natural disasters,  increasing environmental challenges, and economic and social inequities, the  purposes and principles of the United Nations, established more than 70 years ago,  remain relevant and vital. Yet to maintain the confidence of the international  community, the United Nations must demonstrate its ability to adjust in order to keep  pace with and address, effectively and accountably, these contemporary challenges to  international peace and security, economic and social development and respect for  and protection of human rights.   2.  Taken together, my reports on the repositioning of the United Nations  development system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,  restructuring the United Nations peace and security pillar, and shifting the  management paradigm in the United Nations1 set out a road map for strengthening  our capacities to deliver on the promises envisaged by ""we the peoples"" at the  founding of our Organization. While they are proceeding on different tracks, our  efforts are aimed at achieving the same goal: a more effective Secretariat that delivers  better on its mandated activities and uses its resources more effectively. Management  reform will underpin and support the advancement of that goal in all areas of our  work. I am grateful for the receptivity and support of Member States in each of these  reform streams.   3.  My report on shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations identified  a number of internal obstacles that prevent the Secretariat from optimally achieving  the purposes set out in the Charter of the United Nations in the current global  environment. These include the Secretariat's centralized and cumbersome  management structure and administrative framework. With their origins in supporting  the work of the Organization in a bygone era, current practices are often insufficient  to respond to the scope and increased challenges of mandates entrusted to the  Organization by its Member States and do not adequately take into account the fact  that the overwhelming majority of the Secretariat's financial and human resources are  committed to mandated activities outside of Headquarters.   4.  Adjustments to the management framework, structures and procedures will  enable and support renewed vitality and innovation across the Secretariat and the  United Nations system as a whole to fully support the promise of the United Nations.  Building on best practices and lessons learned through previous and ongoing reform  measures, these management reform proposals maintain the overarching goal of  bringing decision-making closer to the point of delivery, simplifying rules, policies  and procedures, decentralizing authority and enabling interoperability across the  United Nations system to enhance the impact and effectiveness of our efforts. They  will address the unintended consequences of previous management reforms. For  example, while the streamlining of contractual arrangements under General Assembly  resolution 63/250 has allowed for greater consistency in the application of staff rules  and administrative issuances and eliminated major barriers for the movement of staff  between Headquarters and the field, harmonization generally occurred against  policies and processes originally developed for Headquarters contexts, significantly  reducing the flexibility required to meet volatile and increasingly challenging  conditions in the field.   5.  Other proposals serve to implement the recommendations of previous reforms.  For example, the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations highlighted the  __________________    1  A/72/124-E/2018/3, A/72/525, A/72/492 and A/72/492/Add.1.    A/72/492/Add.2    7/246  18-04386    general need for a more field-focused framework to better support field operations  and mandate delivery. While this was intended to apply to our peace operations, it is  equally a concern for other entities within the Secretariat, including the offices away  from Headquarters and the regional commissions. As part of the follow-up to the  report of the Panel, process reviews identified key bottlenecks and recommended  measures to improve process efficiency, including increased delegation of authority  to senior managers, strengthened governance, evaluation and monitoring  mechanisms, and updated and improved underlying policy frameworks to address the  challenges of high-tempo operations. Many of these recommendations can be, and are  being, addressed through my management reform.  6.  Central to the success of this reform is the alignment of resource management  authority and mandate delivery responsibility through my proposed paradigm shift to  decentralize management structures and delegate authority to make decisions closer  to the point of delivery, supported by streamlined processes and procedures and  greater accountability. On the one hand, this paradigm shift will enable senior  managers across the Secretariat to take effective, timelier action that is better attuned  to the requirements of a particular situation or country context and to balance  operational and managerial risk. On the other, it will make it possible to more  adequately address risks and fairly and transparently hold senior managers to account  for results.   7.  Shifting the United Nations management paradigm requires considerable effort  to develop simplified, common sense policies, procedures and processes; a  rationalized delegation of authority framework that achieves a proper segregation of  roles and responsibilities and aligns programme/mandate delivery and managerial  responsibilities and accountabilities; and data-based business intelligence and  analysis to support management decisions and enable effective and timely monitoring  and robust compliance and accountability measures. Work is progressing in all of  these areas.  8.  The proposed reorganization of the existing Department of Field Support and  the Department of Management into two new departments -- the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational  Support -- aims to ensure that United Nations management structures better support  all senior managers to achieve effective programme and mandate delivery.   9.  In its resolution 72/266, the General Assembly welcomed my commitment to  improving the ability of the United Nations to deliver on its mandates through  management reform and indicated that it looked forward to receiving a  comprehensive report on my proposals for its consideration.   10. The present report is submitted pursuant to that request and seeks the approval  of the General Assembly of the structural and staffing proposals set out in the report.  If approved by the Assembly, the structures proposed in the present report will be  established as from 1 January 2019. The restructuring of the two departments is post- neutral and respects the resource levels approved by the General Assembly in 2017  for the regular and peacekeeping budgets. New functions will be created within  existing resources through the reassignment and redeployment of existing posts. Over  time, full implementation of the reforms is expected to yield a range of benefits,  including improved effectiveness of mandate delivery, improved transparency and  accountability and enhanced confidence in the ability of the United Nations to deliver  on the mandates entrusted to it by Member States. Some additional financial resources  may be required to lay the foundation necessary to establish the new structures as  from 1 January 2019, including for aligning capacities with the level of additional  delegations of authority, training and transfer or possible agreed separation of staff,  which may be required in exceptional situations. The extent of these requirements is  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  8/246    still being determined. No additional resources are being requested of the Assembly  for such requirements. Instead, the Secretariat will seek to meet them, to the extent  possible, through voluntary contributions.         Management culture and leadership    11.  In order to fully realize the benefits envisaged from the shift in the management  paradigm, the Organization will need to address existing shortcomings in  management culture and leadership, as noted in my report entitled ""Shifting the  management paradigm in the United Nations: ensuring a better future for all"" (see  A/72/492, para. 100). As indicated in that report, the United Nations must move to a  culture that is focused more on results than on processes, better manages  administrative and mandate delivery risks, values innovation and demonstrates a  higher tolerance for honest mistakes and a greater readiness to take prompt corrective  action (ibid., para. 15). Leadership should be norm-based, principled, inclusive,  accountable,  multidimensional,  transformational,  collaborative,  self-applied,  pragmatic and action-oriented.   12. In the past two years, the Secretariat has conducted several assessments to better  understand the current culture. The staff engagement survey showed that 88 per cent  of staff are proud to work for the United Nations and find it a place that respects  racial, cultural and religious diversity. However, additional consultations with  stakeholders across the Secretariat characterized the current Secretariat culture as:     * Hierarchal, bureaucratic, procedural with a reliance on using rules and valuable  time to justify mistakes rather than emphasizing better planning, compliance- oriented with a ""check-the-box"" mentality, Headquarter centric and inefficient     * Internally competitive and siloed, leading to mistrust and risk aversion, as well  as conflicting or redundant activities     * Needing managers who invest in staff, engage staff and utilize performance  management processes and tools well     * Lacking accountability and transparency  13. These assessments demonstrate that the Secretariat has key positive areas to  leverage, while revealing many areas to address and strengthen.   14. Changing the management culture and leadership in the United Nations  Secretariat will require action at every stage of the talent management cycle. Key to  this will be the creation of a revised set of organizational expectations, expressed as  leadership and management competencies and focusing on observable behaviours.  During recruitment and selection, potential senior leaders and managers will be  assessed to determine whether they possess the desired competencies in the context  of overall organizational requirements. Mobility, within and outside of the United  Nations, should be promoted, allowing staff to leave and grow in key managerial and  leadership behaviours and then return to the United Nations for the benefit of the  Organization. In developing talent through learning and performance management, it  should be emphasized that receiving feedback and improving in those competencies  is positive and demonstrates the ability to grow and correct course. Additional  evidence will be obtained concerning how managers and leaders best learn and apply  learning, and this information will drive the development of new programmes and  tools to achieve the desired change in behaviours. These observable behaviours will  also be woven into tools like 360-degree evaluations, so that managers and leaders  can be provided with valuable feedback on their actions. Knowledge management is  an additional enabler of change and will be integrated into learning activities and  tools to help leaders and staff to harness good practices, break down silos and develop  common values across the system. The Department of Management is also    A/72/492/Add.2    9/246  18-04386    undertaking a readiness assessment of the performance management framework to:  (a) enable a more agile approach; (b) foster a culture of ongoing dialogue; (c) shift  from the current focus on compliance; and (d) promote collaboration and greater  accountability for results.   15. In order to enhance transparency, and in line with the new competencies, leaders  will be expected to use data when establishing measurable key performance  indicators. Senior leader compacts will be linked to departmental, divisional,  sectional, team-based and individual work plans. Performance data will inform  continuous performance dialogue within departments, sections and teams and will be  used to assess impact, readjust approaches, develop staff and learn from mistakes to  achieve better results. Such dialogue, grounded in long-term development and built  through trust, need to be at the cornerstone of all manager-staff relations. Networking  will be promoted and provided for more transparently to increase collaboration, break  down silos, increase innovation and spread good practices. Furthermore, data will be  made widely available to staff, continuously improved for quality and accuracy and  used to make informed decisions. Learning and mentoring will also be provided to  senior leaders so that they may develop the necessary skills to implement this  approach.  16. Human resources policies are being simplified. Further review will be necessary  to align policies with new leadership and management competencies, once they are  approved, and to ensure that the policies are forward-thinking and reflect current and  future talent in the organization. This policy simplification will go hand in hand with  the delegation of authority to managers, which will be accompanied by transparent  data on the consistent application of that authority. The data will expose areas in  which policies need further refinement. The Secretariat will align any changes to  existing and new policy frameworks across the development and peace and security  pillars to reinforce accountability and transparency across the United Nations and  build on good practices.   17. The results of the United Nations staff engagement survey and client satisfaction  surveys will be widely shared with staff to promote transparent and honest  engagement. Senior leaders will be required to submit action plans to demonstrate  how they will embrace and address the feedback received from their staff and clients  through such surveys. The Secretary-General will hold senior leaders directly  accountable for delivering their action plans, thus contributing to sustainable  organizational change.   18. Further analysis will be conducted to determine what kind of rewards drive staff  to perform well and deliver high-impact results, and the findings will be used to  improve accountability mechanisms. The findings will also be used to promote  innovation and informed risk-taking. Greater transparency and consistency regarding  rewards and sanctions will reinforce accountability, and efforts will be made to  accelerate the dismissal process for staff and managers who do not achieve the desired  results or who do not exhibit the required competencies.  19. The new leadership and management competencies must be applied starting at  the highest levels. The Secretary-General and senior management will need to exhibit  and advocate for the new competencies, as this will demonstrate to all staff that the  competencies will apply even at the highest levels. Feedback from staff through  biannual employee engagement surveys, and better application of performance  management standards across the Organization, should lead to positive changes in  behaviour that are visible to staff and management, Member States and other external  clients. Finally, the desired changes in management culture and leadership should be  expressed across all aspects of the United Nations, not only during recruitment,  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  10/246    learning and performance management, but in all the communications and actions  undertaken by the United Nations and its staff at all levels.         Impact of management reform on ongoing initiatives     20. Umoja is already a key enabler of important strategic reform initiatives such as  the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and the information  and communications technology (ICT) strategy and is poised to support other  initiatives such as enterprise risk management, the global service delivery model and  the internal control framework. It will be a critical enabler of the Secretary-General's  management reform in simplifying processes, improving responsiveness to  challenges in the field, enabling the decentralization of authority with concomitant  monitoring and oversight, and increasing transparency and accountability for results.  Umoja has paved the way for enhanced and faster client services, better business  continuity and more rapid deployment. The globalization of operations in a single  system has also created additional opportunities for greater access to faster or cheaper  intra-Secretariat services and for leveraging such efficiencies for more fit-for-purpose  business models.   21. The Umoja Extension 2 strategic planning, budget formulation and performance  management solution to be deployed in September 2018 will enable planning and  reporting on utilization of resources based on results frameworks, including  contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals. This will include risk-based  dashboards for programme delivery, which will permit visualization of the impact of  United Nations work through performance indicators. With the ability to link  resources to results frameworks, the entire life cycle of a budget, from formulation  through execution and finally to performance reporting (including evaluation), can be  managed in an integrated fashion, reducing the time needed to build and aggregate  budgets or to review and sign off on them. The ability to retrieve detailed information  quickly (or access it remotely, if needed) can also speed up legislative reviews. The  implementation of an annual budget will be facilitated by this project.  22. Umoja Extension 2 also includes modules that are critical to the success of the  implementation of the supply chain management approach, including in demand  planning, supply network planning and transportation management. Improvements in  enterprise resource planning tools will promote greater transparency, allow further  streamlining of processes and facilitate best value for money by leveraging economies  of scale and improving Organization-wide planning, inventory management and  delivery optimization. The consolidation of procurement and logistics into an  integrated end-to-end office of supply chain management will position the Secretariat  to take full advantage of the future Umoja modules.

The reorganization of the two existing departments into two new departments  will support the paradigm shift to an effective decentralized Secretariat management  framework that equips and empowers senior managers to meet their programme and  mandate delivery objectives. The proposals set out in the present report reflect the  principles brought to the attention of the General Assembly in my report on shifting  the management paradigm of the United Nations (A/72/492), specifically: unity of  command and purpose; clarity of roles and responsibilities; and empowered  delegations of authority that are rational, holistic and decentralized as far as possible,  within an established risk framework, in which risk assessments are supported by  analytics and individual oversight data and the exercise of delegated authority is  supported, monitored and designed so that form follows function.     A/72/492/Add.2    11/246  18-04386    24. The existing departments were established at different times and for different  purposes. The mandate of the Department of Management encompasses the full range  of authorities for the management of human, financial and material resources for the  entirety of the Secretariat. The remit of the Department of Field Support is focused  on dedicated support to peacekeeping and special political missions, as well as United  Nations support to the African Union Mission in Somalia, operating within  management authorities delegated to it by the Department of Management, which the  Department of Field Support subdelegates. The differing scope of the mandates and  delegated authorities results in inconsistent levels and types of service to different  types of entities across the Secretariat. Moreover, the division of responsibilities  between the Department of Field Support and the Department of Management in the  support of peace operations is often unclear. Piecemeal delegations of authority,  duplication of effort, the design and application of policies originally crafted for  non-mission settings and repetitive processes with multiple departmental handover  points all contribute to lengthy timelines and diluted accountability for such critical  business processes as budget formulation, recruitment and procurement. Delayed  management action and support creates frustrations in both departments, in peace  operations and among Member States.   25. Moreover, many of the services delivered by the Department of Field Support  to peace operations are also required by other parts of the Secretariat. In fact, many  departments and offices already benefit from some of these services. For example,  the pools of rostered candidates built through exercises managed by the Field  Personnel Division are available for use across the Secretariat. The Geospatial  Information Section of the Information and Communications Technology Division  provides geospatial and cartographic services to the entire Secretariat. The  Information and Communications Technology Division also supports the  requirements of the international criminal tribunals and the International Residual  Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, and the monitoring of the information and  communications technology infrastructure across the Secretariat is currently  centralized at the Global Service Centre and run as an enterprise service by the  Department of Field Support. The current reform offers an opportunity to ensure that  the operational support provided by the Department of Field Support is more  systematically available across the entire Secretariat.   26. Similarly, while the services provided by the Department of Management are  global, the reform will ensure that strategies, policies and compliance mechanisms  apply across the Organization, including peace operations. The proposed new  structure is designed to deliver tailored solutions to account for different clients, with  a robust performance management framework supported by the organizational  structures, staffing and technology required for transparent and efficient operations.  By separating management strategy, policy and compliance from operations and  ensuring that both departments support the entire Secretariat within their clearly  defined roles and responsibilities, the Secretariat will be able to eliminate duplication,  streamline processes, create synergies and provide more timely and effective  management support to programme and mandate delivery across the Secretariat.   27. In recent years, the Secretariat has undertaken several initiatives to improve the  ability of missions to deliver in the field. These include the September 2017 guidance  on mission support structures, which addressed identified shortfalls and incorporated  recent developments in best practice, such as the adoption of the supply chain  management approach, the expansion of shared services, the implementation of the  environmental strategy and the further development and deployment of Umoja. Over  the next two financial periods, field missions will implement a standardized structure  whereby directors and chiefs of mission support will oversee three pillars within their  mission support components: an operations and resource management pillar, a service  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  12/246    delivery management pillar and a supply chain management pillar. The key change is  the introduction of the operations and resource management pillar, which will provide  greater coherence in forecasting, monitoring, planning and coordination by uniting  cross-cutting mission support functions. This initiative is separate from, but  complementary to, both the management reform and the global service delivery  model. The proposed structure of the Department of Operational Support includes  clear counterparts to each of the three proposed pillars, which will facilitate the  delivery of operational advice and support from Headquarters to missions, among  other clients, and enable them to responsibly exercise their delegated authorities.   28. While addressing the structural challenges to effective and accountable mandate  delivery is critical and is the subject of the present report, it will not be sufficient to  ensure that the Organization is able to deliver. The reorganization of the management  structures at Headquarters to facilitate the paradigm shift to a decentralized  Secretariat must be accompanied by a strategic and comprehensive review of the  Organization's regulatory framework to support the new management paradigm and  reflect the reality that the bulk of the activities of the Secretariat -- representing the  overwhelming majority of its human and financial resources -- take place outside of  Headquarters duty stations. Such a review has been initiated under the leadership of  the Department of Management, and a new human resources management strategy, as  well as proposed amendments to the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations, in full alignment with the management reform principles, will be presented  to the General Assembly for its consideration during the main part of its seventy-third  session. Beyond these measures, however, the Secretariat must undergo a longer-term  culture shift to allow for the full benefits of the various streams of reform to be  realized.   29. While the present report focuses on the structures of the proposed Department  of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the proposed Department of  Operational Support, it cannot be stressed enough that the focus of the management  reforms is on the empowerment of the nearly 100 discrete departments, offices,  regional commissions, tribunals and field operations that make up the Secretariat and  that the new management structures exist to support these client entities in delivering  their mandates effectively and accountably. Moreover, many of the services currently  provided by offices away from Headquarters and regional commissions to other  offices in the same duty stations are the type of services that will be provided by the  Department of Operational Support in the future. In order to minimize disruptions in  support and to leverage the specialized knowledge and relationships that have been  built up over time, the Secretariat envisages that the offices away from Headquarters  and regional commissions will continue to deliver location-dependent services, on the  one hand, and operational support functions to their existing clients on behalf of the  Department of Operational Support, on the other.         Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance     30. Under the new paradigm, the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance will facilitate the timelier, more effective, transparent and accountable  delivery of mandates across the Secretariat. It will provide policy leadership in all  management areas through a clear, integrated global management strategy and policy  framework and through strengthened monitoring, evaluation and accountability  mechanisms that oversee the exercise of delegated authorities in a decentralized  management paradigm. It will contribute to a culture of continuous learning and  accountability and promote innovation in business models throughout the Secretariat,  with a strong focus on the field.   31. The Department will encompass three pillars: a finance and budget pillar  responsible for policy and guidance on all strategic issues related to programme    A/72/492/Add.2    13/246  18-04386    planning, budgeting, finance, and programme and financial performance; a human  resources pillar providing strategic direction and policy leadership in the area of  human resources; and a business transformation and accountability pillar which will  combine capacities for monitoring and evaluation, risk management, organizational  performance measurement and support to business transformation and innovation.  The Department will also, jointly with the Department of Operational Support,  manage the activities of the Office of Information and Communications Technology.   32. The Office of Finance and Budget will act as the central provider of policy,  instruction, guidance and advice for all programme planning, budgeting, finance, and  programme and financial performance across the Secretariat. It will develop and  promulgate policy on financial and budgetary matters. It will ensure a culture of  responsible, transparent and accountable fiscal management, in which financial  resources are planned, utilized and reported in an effective and efficient manner.   33. The Department will play a key role in shaping the organizational culture,  including through enhancing diversity, organizational development and leadership,  learning, career support and performance management. The Office of Human  Resources will provide strategic direction and policy leadership in all human  resources matters. The Department will align the Organization's human resources  capacity with its mission and mandates through the development and refinement of a  global human resources strategy and innovative policies based on both organizational  and staff needs.   34. The Office of Human Resources will monitor emerging human resources  management issues throughout the Secretariat and manage staff-management  relations by ensuring the effective participation of staff in issues relating to staff  welfare, including conditions of work, general conditions of life and other human  resources policies. The Office will also be responsible for administrative law and  conduct and discipline matters for the entire global Secretariat.   35. Central to the activities of the Department will be the Business Transformation  and Accountability Division, which will establish and mainstream accountability  systems to drive a results-based culture and the proactive management of risk. By  leveraging the global management reporting capabilities of Umoja and other  enterprise solutions, the Division will use business analytics to provide real-time  support on performance to senior managers and other internal and external  stakeholders and will conduct management reviews and quality assurance functions  in a cycle of continuous improvement. It will review the findings and  recommendations from the oversight bodies and will support managers in self- evaluation activities from which they and the Organization can learn and improve  planning and decision-making. It will also continually seek opportunities to  modernize and innovate and will manage large-scale business transformation  projects.   36. The Department will be responsible for the development, implementation and  monitoring of an enhanced delegation of authority framework that clearly aligns  authority with responsibility and for monitoring its application. Delegations of  authority will be underpinned by a clear and simplified policy framework, which will  be reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that it is effective and efficient in  supporting the delivery of mandates and the added accountability associated with  clearly delineated roles and responsibilities across the Secretariat.   37. On management issues, the Department will represent the Secretary-General  before relevant expert and intergovernmental bodies, such as the Advisory Committee  for Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Fifth Committee and the  International Civil Service Commission, as well as inter-agency coordination  mechanisms, including the High-level Committee on Management of the United  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  14/246    Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), and in the conduct  of staff-management consultations.         Department of Operational Support     38. The proposed Department of Operational Support will be the operational arm of  the Secretariat and the client-facing interface for operational support matters in the  new management structure. It will have two main functions: to support decision- making by empowered senior managers through advisory capacities closely focused  on the point of delivery; and to support the implementation of decisions through  operational support, including shared transactional services. In addition, it will  support entities within the Secretariat, such as small offices at Headquarters or in the  field, that lack either a dedicated executive office or administrative unit or the  capacity to meet the demands of surge requirements or unusual circumstances. In  exceptional circumstances, the Department will exercise delegated authority on  behalf of entities or field operations, such as during mission start-up or when the  Secretary-General has withdrawn delegations of authority at the recommendation of  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   39. The Department will broadly be organized into four pillars: an operational  support pillar that will be responsible for advisory capacities and operational  activities that benefit from consolidated global planning and execution; a shared  services pillar that will perform location-independent and administrative tasks and  other corporate services through shared service centres; a special services pillar that  will provide cross-cutting support, such as planning and analysis, exercise delegated  authority on behalf of clients to whom authority has not been delegated or from which  delegated authority has been withdrawn, and support start-up, surge, transition and  downsizing activities; and an administration division responsible for day-to-day  support, including in facilities  management, information technology and  administrative services to clients at Headquarters. Detailed information on the shared  services pillar is presented separately in the report of the Secretary-General on the  global service delivery model for the United Nations Secretariat (A/72/801).   40. The Department will also jointly manage the activities of the Office of  Information and Communications Technology.   41. When clients require advice on the exercise of their delegated authority, their  business partners would be their first point of contact. The advisory capacities within  the Department of Operational Support will serve as a resource for business partners.  For cases requiring exceptional policy clarification, the Department of Operational  Support will seek the guidance of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance. Having a consistent approach to providing advice to clients across  the Secretariat will address many of the challenges faced today and will facilitate  analysis of trends related to the types of issues that affect clients.   42. The operational support pillar of the Department will consist of the Office of  Support Operations and the Office of Supply Chain Management, each of which will  be led by an Assistant Secretary-General.   43. The Office of Support Operations will consist of the Human Resources Services  Division, the Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and Health Division  and the Capacity Development and Operational Training Service. The Office of  Supply Chain Management will draw upon the combined resources of the existing  Logistics Support and Procurement Divisions to allow the Organization to have the  right goods and services at the right place, the right time and the right cost, all while  ensuring the requisite segregation of duties. In addition, a dedicated Uniformed  Capabilities Support Division will integrate the activities currently performed by  different parts of the Department of Field Support and the Department of Management    A/72/492/Add.2    15/246  18-04386    that support the end-to-end force generation, deployment and reimbursement process,  and will serve as a single point of entry for support issues related to military and  police contingents, thereby improving the quality of interaction with troop- and  police-contributing countries.   44. The Division for Special Activities will oversee a range of specialized or  cross-cutting operational capacities. A large part of its responsibilities will be to  support start-up, surge, transition and liquidation requirements and to exercise  authority on behalf of entities to which authority has not been granted owing to a lack  of capacity or from which authority has been temporarily withdrawn. The Division  for Special Activities will also include a cross-cutting Resource Planning and  Analysis Section, an operational planning capacity to identify and plan for emerging  support requirements and a dedicated support partnerships capacity to manage  relationships with non-Secretariat entities that the United Nations has been mandated  to support, such as the African Union or the Group of Five for the Sahel.   45. Finally, the Division of Administration will provide dedicated support to clients  at Headquarters similar to the support provided by directors of administration in the  offices away from Headquarters. Support provided by the Division will include  business partner functions for offices in New York that lack a dedicated executive  office, visa and travel services, facilities management, and local information and  communications infrastructure and technical support.         Office of Information and Communications Technology     46. A single Office of Information and Communications Technology will be  established through the consolidation of the existing Office of Information and  Communications Technology in the Department of Management and the Information  and Communications Technology Division in the Department of Field Support. As  this Office will both perform some policy- and standard-setting functions and deliver  operational support to clients throughout the Secretariat, it will retain reporting lines  to both the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support. Given that  ICT is a cross-cutting function underpinning the Organization's core mandates and  activities, a single entity to cover the Organization's operations and business  processes from end to end under a single integrated structure with a holistic approach  to the delivery of ICT services will meet client needs. ICT is driven by the rapid pace  of technological change. The placement of strategy, policy and compliance functions  within the same office as ICT operations will enable rapid and responsive service  delivery, particularly in relation to standards and architecture, and will facilitate  continual updates and improvements to the compliance framework. The unified ICT  structure will allow the Organization to leverage the gains already made and to  expedite the remaining elements of the ICT strategy. It will also enable an agile  approach and leverage technology and innovation to enable the core work of the  Organization.         Management Client Board     47. The Management Client Board, an internal management body co-chaired by the  heads of the two new departments, will serve as a feedback mechanism between the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of  Operational Support and client entities. Membership will include rotating  representatives of each of the different types of client entities across the Secretariat,  namely, departments and offices at Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters,  regional commissions, peace operations and field-based offices of special advisers  and envoys. The Board will serve as a mechanism by which the different types of  clients can ensure that the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  16/246    Compliance and the Department of Operational Support are aware of and better able  to address their particular requirements and concerns, thereby improving the ability  of the two departments to best support all Secretariat entities in achieving the  purposes of the Organization and delivering on the mandates established by Member  States. Where an operational requirement is identified, the Board will also feed into  policymaking processes, including the development of field-specific policies, if  required.         III.  Delegation of authority       48. The Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer of the United Nations,  as established in article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations. Currently, the  Secretary-General delegates administrative authority to the Under-Secretary-General  for Management, who may then subdelegate it. Under the current delegation of  authority framework, there is no consistency in how the various types of authority are  delegated and subdelegated. They may be delegated ad personam or by function. They  may be delegated fully or partially. Whether a senior manager in a particular entity  has a higher degree of delegated authority than another manager -- if that particular  manager has delegated authority at all -- is generally more a matter of past practice  than a structured assessment of risk or responsibilities. When the level of delegated  authority is insufficient for the execution of required tasks, decisions must be taken  elsewhere, where there may not be as much knowledge about the specific  requirements or context, introducing delays in implementation. Furthermore, in most  cases, authority is delegated directly to directors of administration or directors of  mission support, bypassing entirely the head of the entity, to whom mandate delivery  is entrusted. Altogether, the existing system entrenches a misalignment of the  responsibility for mandate delivery and the authority needed to manage the financial,  human and material resources required for mandate delivery. The misalignment both  impedes managerial action and dilutes accountability. The General Assembly, in its  resolutions 53/221, 64/259 and 71/314, has articulated concerns about the functioning  of the existing system of delegation of authority, and the incremental measures taken  in the past to address those concerns have largely been ineffective, as noted by the  Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Board of Auditors and the Joint Inspection  Unit. The Board of Auditors also recommended that the Administration review,  update and rationalize the current delegations of authority.   49. The General Assembly, in its resolution 71/283, stressed the need for the  Secretary-General to address the deficiencies in the current delegation of authority  system through the promulgation of well-defined roles and responsibilities of  individuals at all levels to whom authority is delegated, systemic reporting  mechanisms on monitoring and exercise of delegated authority and actions to be taken  in cases of mismanagement or abuse of authority. To that end, the Secretariat  undertook a comprehensive mapping of the flow of the current delegations of  authority. During 2018, a comprehensive review of the existing authorities and an  assessment of individual capacities and monitoring requirements will be completed.   50. To meet these challenges, the Secretary-General has decided to delegate directly  to heads of entities across the Secretariat the full administrative authority needed for  the effective stewardship of their financial, human and material resources. This step  aims to provide for a more effective delivery of mandates in a streamlined and  transparent manner, thereby also strengthening accountability. Ad personam  delegations of authority will be replaced by functional delegations of authority, so  that managers recruited against specific functions will be selected and maintained in  their positions on the basis of their ability to responsibly and accountably exercise  those delegations. Furthermore, to the extent possible, authorities should be aligned    A/72/492/Add.2    17/246  18-04386    with responsibilities in order to ensure a chain of command and accountability that is  clear and unambiguous. The scope of the delegation of authority necessary to carry  out the responsibilities entrusted to the head of an entity will be determined by the  Secretary-General, on the basis of guidance from the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation with the Department of Operational  Support, from a rational, risk-based menu of options. Under the established risk  framework, the risk assessment will be supported by analytics and individual  oversight data, while the exercise of delegation of authority will be supported,  monitored and designed so that form follows function. The default starting position  will be full delegation, but specific delegation portfolios will be tailored to each entity  based on its capacity and capability to exercise delegations in an accountable manner.  In circumstances in which capacity gaps exist, the Department of Operational Support  will exercise the delegated authorities and, where appropriate, work with the senior  manager concerned until such time as the required capacity has been developed to the  satisfaction of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   51. To ensure a clear line of responsibility and accountability, heads of entities will,  in turn, be responsible for subdelegating their authorities to others in the entity, based  on functional responsibilities.   52. The requirements for the implementation of each delegation will be established  by the Secretary-General upon review and recommendation by the Under-Secretary- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation with the  Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support. The Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance will be responsible for monitoring and evaluating  compliance with the delegation of authority framework, including whether  circumstances have arisen that justify the curtailment of any delegation, in whole or  in part. In such cases, upon the recommendation of the Under-Secretary-General for  Management, Strategy, Policy and Compliance, the Secretary-General will take  remedial action, including by limiting, redirecting or withdrawing the authority in  question. The Department of Operational Support will then work with the entity in  question to enhance its capability until such time that the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance is confident that the entity can responsibly exercise  the delegated authority.   53. To reflect the direct delegation of authority from the Secretary-General and the  fact that the Department of Management will no longer exist, the relevant financial  and staff rules will be revised to reflect the change in modalities for the delegation of  authority. In accordance with standard practice, all amendments to the financial and  staff rules will be presented for the information of the General Assembly.   54. Greater delegation of authority to managers, supported by strengthened risk  management and accountability frameworks, will enable the responsible stewardship  of the resources of Member States, a more responsive and proactive United Nations  and, therefore, improved programme and mandate delivery.         IV. Accountability      55. Today it is often difficult to hold individual managers accountable for specific  decisions or actions, owing in large part to the complex nature of policies and  processes and the convoluted delegations of authority that result in many layers in the  decision-making process. Senior managers throughout the Secretariat often point out  that, while they are responsible for implementing mandates and delivering results,  they do not have control over all the resources they need to manage their programmes.  The Secretariat cannot be effective with decisions being controlled away from the  operational realities, or with responsibility for resources delegated to anyone other  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  18/246    than those entrusted with mandate delivery. By greatly simplifying resource  management policies and processes and aligning resource management delegations  of authority with programme and mandate delivery authorities and responsibilities,  managers can be held to full account for what they achieve and deliver and the  resources expended and decisions taken to that end. In return, the Secretary-General  will require full accountability and transparency. The Secretary-General will delegate  authority directly to senior managers and they will be directly accountable to him.   56. The Secretary-General is determined to create a culture of empowerment and  accountability, ensuring that leaders, managers and staff have the ability and tools to  achieve their goals as they conduct their own work and take collective action.  Managers must have the necessary authority to fulfil their responsibilities to  contribute their part to mandate implementation. It must be communicated clearly to  managers what is expected of them and that their performance will be measured  against clear and fair standards in their exercise of delegated management authority  and programme and mandate delivery.   57. In order to better support managers, the Department of Management is  reviewing the current policy framework and procedures to ensure that they are clear  and up to date. In 2017 and 2018, several outdated administrative instructions were  abolished and others are currently being revised and simplified. Finance, human  resources and procurement manuals will be revised and updated to ensure that  managers and staff are clear on their respective roles and responsibilities and the  procedures to be followed. Senior managers and staff will be further supported  through the restructuring of the Department of Management and the Department of  Field Support into one department with responsibility for defining the Organization's  management strategy and policies and ensuring compliance, and another providing  support in the implementation of policies, as well as operational and transactional  support. The new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will  act as the Secretary-General's agent in providing the necessary horizontal quality  assessment and monitoring across the Organization and in holding United Nations  officials to account for their performance. Depending on the nature of a detected  problem, responses could range from providing additional policy guidance or  capacity-building or implementing managerial tools to revoking the delegated  authority or imposing administrative and disciplinary measures, as appropriate, in  accordance with the Staff Regulations and Rules.  58. The United Nations has in place an individual and institutional accountability  framework to promote compliance, transparency and the effective stewardship of  resources in the delivery of mandates, which is summarized in the formal definition  of accountability established by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/259. The  framework comprises a number of elements, including a body of regulations and rules  governing the activities of the Secretariat and a number of structures intended to  address different aspects of accountability within the Organization. In this regard, it  is the Secretary-General's intention with the reform proposals to simplify the existing  regulatory framework by means of a comprehensive policy framework review and the  development of clear and simplified policies and administrative guidance over the  coming year, supported by a baseline of simplified processes and procedures that can  be more easily applied by staff, thereby enabling informed, robust and accountable  decision-making.   59. Key aspects of managerial responsibility and accountability at all levels are also  detailed in the seventh progress report of the Secretary-General on accountability  (A/72/773). Managers will be delegated greater decision-making authority in the use  of resources to support programme delivery and mandate implementation. Training  and support will be provided in the proper use of that delegated authority. Senior  managers will be supported by two departments in their use of the delegation of    A/72/492/Add.2    19/246  18-04386    authority (see paras. 50-53 above). In this context, the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance will develop an organizational policy framework  that facilitates effective management and resource use in support of programme  delivery. The Department of Operational Support will provide transactional,  operational and advisory support. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance will monitor the use of the delegation of authority to ensure that it is  in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Organization, the policy  framework and internal controls.   60. The Organization as a whole, and its individual staff members, will be held  accountable for delivering agreed results, while complying with regulations, rules and  ethical standards. They will also be expected to proactively identify and manage risks  that threaten the achievement of their objectives. Performance, both programmatic  and managerial, will be systematically monitored, evaluated and reported.  Programme managers will take corrective actions in order to keep plans on track, and  lessons learned will be used to inform future planning. Programme planning and  performance information will be updated and reported to Member States on an annual  basis, in the context of the annual programme budget document. In addition,  programme and financial performance of individual programmes will be reflected on  dashboards, which will be updated on a quarterly basis. The dashboards will be  accessible to Member States and staff.  61. The strengthening of the implementation of results-based management, the  redirection of the efforts of staff at all levels towards the achievement of the  Organization's objectives and goals and the shift in the focus of the Secretariat's  efforts from inputs and activities to results and outcomes will be important elements  of the accountability framework. A dedicated results-based management function in  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will work with  individual departments, offices and missions to ensure that the results to be achieved  are reflected in all planning documents and flow from the Organization-wide planning  and budget documents, down through the senior managers' compacts and are reflected  in individual staff workplans. The Board of Auditors has repeatedly recommended the  development of a detailed plan for embedding results-based management throughout  the Organization. To that end, the implementation of an action plan to ensure that  results-based management is embedded in the work of the Organization will be  initiated in 2018. It will reflect the recommendations of the Board of Auditors  regarding the importance of visible leadership from senior management in promoting  and advancing the accountability system as a whole by setting an appropriate tone at  the top to drive forward the implementation of results-based management, the need  to build a strong culture of self-evaluation by programme managers and the  importance of using performance measures that reflect the main expected  accomplishments of a department and that are helpful to managers trying to  understand current performance (see A/69/5 (Vol.I), chap. II, para. 30, and A/71/5  (Vol. I), chap II, para. 93).   62. Transparency to Member States will be further enhanced through online  dashboards that provide programme performance information and results of self- evaluation and lessons-learned exercises and a portal presenting expenditure  information extracted from Umoja in an interactive and accessible manner.   63. Risk management will be a priority. The Secretary-General's vision supports an  approach to risk management that is pragmatic and action-oriented, taking principled  and practical action to deliver on mandates, balancing administrative and operational  risks and erring on the side of action when necessary to prevent and address human  suffering. The Secretary-General is introducing a ""three lines of defence"" model,  which will clarify essential roles and responsibilities for risk management and  internal controls within the Organization and improve the effectiveness of the risk  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  20/246    management systems. Under this model, the first line of defence is the managers and  staff who own and manage risks in their areas of operation. The second line of defence  is the centralized, business-enabling functions focusing on compliance and risk  management activities. The third line of defence is the Office of Internal Oversight  Services, which provides senior management and the General Assembly with  independent assurance regarding the effectiveness of risk management and internal  controls, including on the manner in which the first and second lines of defence  achieve their objectives. The Board of Auditors, as the external auditors of the  Organization, as well as the Joint Inspection Unit and the Independent Audit Advisory  Committee, play an important role in the control structure and will provide additional  independent assurances of the effectiveness of the controls and the use of financial  resources. While they reside outside the Organization's structure, they provide  independent, external assurances to the General Assembly.  64. With the proper implementation of an effective ""three lines of defence"" model,  and the current and additional internal control systems that will be put into effect with  the reforms, the overall level of risk will not increase because adequate capabilities  to monitor and control risk will have been created. The main change will be an  enhanced awareness among managers of their responsibility to identify and  proactively manage risks in their areas of responsibility and that they will be guided  and supported as necessary.         V. Financing arrangements      65. During its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General on shifting the  management paradigm in the United Nations (A/72/492), the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions requested information on the use of the  peacekeeping support account and how it may be adapted for the new management  structures, given that both departments will serve the entire Secretariat and not just  peacekeeping operations (see A/72/7/Add.24, para. 39 (b)). As decided by the General  Assembly in 1995 in its resolution 49/250 and regularly reaffirmed in the years since,  the support account for peacekeeping operations exists to finance the post and  non-post resources required for the backstopping of peacekeeping operations at  Headquarters, and any changes in that limitation require the prior approval of the  Assembly. The Department of Field Support and the Department of Management are  currently funded through both the regular budget and the support account. As the  resources of both departments and their associated funding sources have been  allocated on the basis of previous decisions by the Assembly, the present report  maintains the existing apportionment across funding sources for post and non-post  resources that are being drawn from the two existing departments to establish the two  new departments.  66. Once the new departments are created and they support the totality of  peacekeeping and non-peacekeeping activities of the Secretariat, the Secretary- General will submit a proposal to the General Assembly at the second part of its  seventy-fourth session to establish a clear and consistent approach to financing the  two new departments from the support account based on the initial experience gained  from the implementation of the ""whole-of-the-Secretariat"" approach.

Diversity and Outreach Section    122. The Diversity and Outreach Section will develop strategies and initiatives aimed  at building a diverse workforce across the Organization. They will address specific  workforce needs by leading a range of outreach activities tailored to staffing gaps  identified by the Strategic Workforce Planning Section. In order to achieve the  objective of equitable geographical distribution, it will coordinate Organization-wide  efforts to increase geographical and regional diversity across all departments, offices  and missions and the appropriate representation of troop-contributing countries in  peacekeeping operations. The team will collaborate with the Business Transformation  and Accountability Division to monitor progress towards parity targets, ensuring that  the Organization meets the bold targets of the Secretary General's system-wide  strategy on gender parity. It will also develop new approaches that organizational  entities can use to build a working environment that embraces the widest possible  spectrum of diversity and that empowers women and men to build an enabling and  gender-sensitive workplace. It will undertake targeted outreach campaigns to draw  upon the broadest pool of candidates for Secretariat positions, focusing on attracting  candidate populations to support operational needs and the mandates of the General  Assembly. The team will also develop innovative outreach initiatives to continuously  attract and retain a diverse workforce, which will include a focus on engaging youth  to bring fresh ideas and talent into the Organization.         Organizational Learning, Performance Management and Staff  Development Section    123. The Organizational Learning, Performance Management and Staff Development  Section will put in place an Organization-wide framework to develop staff talent  throughout the entire employee life cycle, including onboarding, learning,  performance management and career development. It will nurture a culture of  engagement, leadership and results, based on the United Nations system leadership  framework and organizational values and competencies. Through Organization-wide  change initiatives, the team will support ongoing reform and transformation,  responding to input from staff and strategic and operational priorities. The team will  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  32/246    support staff performance through a robust performance management system that will  be linked to organizational objectives and that will engage staff and managers in  carefully planning, evaluating and improving performance. It will provide tools for  recognizing strong performance, providing honest feedback and constructively  addressing underperformance. The team will also build a strong foundation of  multilingualism and core competence, ensuring that staff continuously develop and  maintain the skills and knowledge they need to deliver results. Through leadership  assessment and development programmes, the team will ensure that the Organization  builds a strong pool of leaders that demonstrate a high level of ethics and integrity  and a focus on results. The team will also provide a set of resources and tools to help  staff set career objectives so that they can continuously move forward on their career  paths.        Administrative Law Division    124. The Administrative Law Division will provide client-focused strategic, policy  and legal expertise and guidance for all aspects of human resources application within  the internal justice system, on behalf of the Secretary-General, and an integrated  approach to the implementation of the United Nations standards of conduct for all  categories of personnel serving throughout the Secretariat.   125. The Division will manage administrative appeals for human resources matters  and regularly provide input to the Global Strategy and Policy Division to update  human resources policies on the basis of lessons learned from jurisprudence and  informally resolved matters. The Division will also serve as an integrated solution  with respect to the implementation of United Nations standards of conduct for all  categories of personnel serving throughout the Secretariat by:    * Overseeing and coordinating actions required to address disciplinary cases for  staff and non-staff personnel, including those deployed in the United Nations by  Member States    * Overseeing and coordinating preventive efforts, including comprehensive risk  management, as well as accountability mechanisms, for all categories of  personnel    * Providing a rapid and Secretariat-wide coordinated response to address critical  issues that affect the welfare and safety of personnel, serious reputational risks  and/or other risks adversely impacting the Organization's core values and norms  (""critical incidents"")    * Building capacities among Secretariat entities to promote and enforce the  United Nations standards of conduct    * Interacting with departments and offices, including all those with a field  presence, to support delegated decision-making processes and strengthened  internal accountability functions, building-related capacities and interacting  with Member States in the exercise of their accountability functions     * Reporting to intergovernmental and expert bodies, including the General  Assembly, about its work  126. Incorporated within the Division are the following functional areas, which  support the overall goals of the Division: the Appeals Management Section; the  Conduct and Discipline Service; and the Critical Incident Response Service.        Appeals Management Section    127. The Appeals Management Section will represent the Secretary-General before  the United Nations Dispute Tribunal on appeals against administrative decisions. This    A/72/492/Add.2    33/246  18-04386    will include filing written submissions on legal and factual issues, reviewing written  submissions from staff members that filed the cases and appearing at case  management discussions and hearings on the merits. The team will also provide legal  advice and guidance on internal justice matters to offices and departments that are  impacted, including those with field presences, both prior to a matter being before the  Dispute Tribunal (in conjunction with Management Evaluation Unit and/or the  Department of Operational Support) and once a matter is pending before the Dispute  Tribunal. Lessons learned from jurisprudence will be collated and fed back to the  Global Strategy and Policy Division and the Department of Operational Support.         Conduct and Discipline Service    128. The Conduct and Discipline Service will develop and carry out programmes in  support of the Division's policy, strategic and legislated responsibilities in connection  with the application of the United Nations standards of conduct. The Service will  ensure that these standards are effectively harmonized and applicable to all categories  of United Nations personnel, including personnel deployed by Member States. The  Service will, together with partners, lead the development and monitor the  implementation of conduct and discipline policies, procedures and guidelines, taking  into account applicable accountability frameworks, and identify best practices to  facilitate compliance with conduct and discipline standards by personnel deployed  with the United Nations by Member States.   129. The Service will adopt an integrated approach in providing global oversight of  the application of the United Nations standards of conduct for all categories of United  Nations personnel. It will interact directly with officials throughout the Secretariat  with delegated authority to address conduct issues, as well as with Member States in  the exercise of their authority to address conduct issues.   130. Through the Service, the Division will continue to manage and oversee the  misconduct tracking system that is in place for peace operations, which is used for data  analysis, case management and reporting, including through its public website, and will  progressively deploy this system to the entire Secretariat. It will also continue to vet  United Nations personnel against a history of prior misconduct while in the service of  the United Nations and work to expand this vetting function to all Secretariat  appointments and personnel. Together with partners in learning and training, the Service  will develop training programmes on upholding United Nations standards of conduct,  including with regard to sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual and workplace  harassment and fraud, in order to further strengthen transparency and accountability.   131. The Division will also develop and implement policies and advisory support in  the areas of communication, outreach and awareness-raising strategies with public  information partners; enforcement mechanisms, together with Member States and  relevant stakeholders; and remedial action.   132. The Administrative Law Division will also manage all disciplinary matters  involving United Nations staff Secretariat-wide and will represent the Secretary- General before the Dispute Tribunal in relation to challenges of disciplinary  decisions. Through this function, the Division will gather and provide feedback on  lessons learned from the conduct of disciplinary processes and/or disciplinary matters  before the Dispute Tribunal. With regard to disciplinary matters falling under the  jurisdiction of Member States, the Division will ensure that required actions are taken  as appropriate and that information is provided to the Secretariat on the actions taken.         Critical Incident Response Service    133. Effective coordination and capacity-building will be critical to ensure that the  standards of conduct are fully integrated and consistently understood and applied  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  34/246    across the Secretariat. Regular functional briefings will be provided to heads of  departments and offices, including regional commissions and offices away from  Headquarters, with particular emphasis on consultation with and updates for  departments with field presences, such as the Department of Peace Operations, the  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Political  and Peacebuilding Affairs, with regard to issues related to conduct and discipline as  may arise in the activities overseen by those departments.   134. The integration of the conduct and discipline function to cover the entire  Secretariat and to account for all categories of personnel will require dedicated and  ongoing efforts to strengthen capacities in all offices and departments, including those  with field presences. The Division will contribute to the development of a network of  conduct and discipline practitioners to enhance consistency in the application of the  standards of conduct, as well as transparency and accountability.   135. In order to ensure that the Organization is well placed to respond to emerging  issues that raise serious concerns with respect to the application and enforcement of  the standards of conduct, the Division will develop procedures and capacities to  provide a flexible, rapid, comprehensive and coordinated response to critical  incidents related to the implementation of the United Nations standards of conduct.  This specialized team will respond to complex and critical cases and/or areas of  significant risk, including by building capacities for critical incident response, as well  as contributing directly to incident management as needed. The nature of such  incident management may include taking actions to limit and mitigate damage to  individuals and the Organization and review and strengthen risk management  measures. This function will enable the Organization to assess strategies to ensure  accountability and remedial action, in coordination with relevant stakeholders,  including the Ethics Office, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and other  investigating entities, the Department of Safety and Security and, in consultation with  the Office of Legal Affairs, national authorities.   136. Another aspect of critical incident management is the ongoing implementation  of Security Council resolution 2272 (2016), as expanded upon by General Assembly  in its resolution 71/278, with regard to the repatriation of military or police units when  there is credible evidence of widespread or systemic sexual exploitation and abuse by  those units. An internal Secretariat committee has been established, led by the Under- Secretary-General for Field Support to address this matter. The Conduct and  Discipline Unit of the Department of Field Support currently serves as secretariat for  the committee; in the future, the coordination, capacity-building and incident  management function in the Administrative Law Division will perform this role.  Under the new structure, the functions of the Chair will be exercised by the Under- Secretary-General for Peace Operations, and the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will serve as a member of the  committee.   137. The functions of the Division will also include the management of the trust fund  in support of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse, in response to the significant  impact of critical incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse. This will include  management of the programme of assistance to victims and coordination with the  Secretariat and inter-agency partners on assistance to victims.         D. Business Transformation and Accountability Division       138. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division is integral to the  Secretary-General's vision of a transformation of the Organization, based on sound  management principles, to make the United Nations more nimble, effective, efficient,    A/72/492/Add.2    35/246  18-04386    transparent and accountable. The Division will facilitate continuous learning and  improvement. It will house in one entity all the functions dedicated to monitoring and  strengthening performance and accountability, which will enable a more holistic view  of performance and constant feedback for lessons learned.   139. By mainstreaming results-based management and enterprise risk management  in the planning and daily operations of the Secretariat, the Division will help  managers clarify and communicate the results to be achieved and the risks to be  managed. It will support programme managers in their efforts to establish clear targets  and criteria for programme performance and will generate, analyse and communicate  data, conduct reviews and support self-evaluations. It will provide support to  programme managers in their monitoring, assessment and reporting of programme  performance. Such performance-related information and lessons learned will, in turn,  contribute to future planning. Programme performance will be reported in the  programme budget and peacekeeping budget documents and reflected on dashboards.  140. The Division will be the key enabler of the Secretary-General's proposal to  delegate authority closer to the point of delivery, by providing the guidance required  by programme managers to exercise their enhanced delegation of authority. With  support from the Division, managers will be empowered to determine how best to use  their resources to implement mandates. The Division, in cooperation with the  Department of Operational Support, will monitor how managers exercise the  authority. Where problems are detected, the Division will investigate the cause and  recommend additional support, corrective actions or, if necessary, recommend  withdrawal of the delegated authority. When such withdrawal occurs, the Division  will work with the Department of Operational Support on the measures deemed  necessary to enable its reissuance.  141. In addition to these performance- and compliance-related functions, the  Division will continually seek opportunities to modernize and innovate and will play  a project management role for large business transformation projects. It will also carry  out responsibilities in the area of business continuity and organizational resilience. It  will comprise three functional pillars: accountability systems; monitoring and  evaluation; and analytics and project management.  142. The secretariats of the Advisory Committee on Procurement and the Property  Survey Board and of the Vendor Review Committee will also be located in the  Business Transformation and Accountability Division and will report to the Director.        Accountability Systems Service    143. The Accountability Systems Service will be responsible for mainstreaming two  critical systems of accountability: results-based management, including the setting of  organizational targets and results to be achieved, and enterprise risk management,  which entails the management of risks that threaten the achievement of the desired  results. It will also analyse oversight body recommendations, reflect the findings in  policies and future planning exercises and hold managers accountable for the  implementation of oversight body recommendations.  144. The Results-based Management Section will be responsible for mainstreaming  the results-based approach by advising and supporting Secretariat departments,  offices and missions to ensure full implementation. It will develop, maintain and  update standards, policies and procedures for results-based management; coordinate  and standardize guidelines and training materials to ensure a cohesive approach to  results-based management concepts throughout the Organization; and conduct  training. It will support the implementation of the results-based management action  plan. The team, in close consultation with the Office of Finance and Budget, will  support departments, offices and missions in preparing the annual framework of  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  36/246    targets and deliverables that managers and the Secretariat as a whole will be held  accountable for achieving. The team will conduct macro-level organizational  planning to assist in the preparation of the plan outline covering the longer-term  objectives of the Organization to ensure an integrated, holistic and strategic approach  to the work of the Organization.   145. The Enterprise Risk Management Section will work with all departments,  offices and field missions to take a systematic and holistic approach to identifying,  assessing, evaluating, prioritizing, managing and controlling risk across the  Organization in order to increase the likelihood that it will achieve its objectives. In  line with the Secretary-General's vision for shifting the management paradigm, the  team will work to ensure that the simplified policy framework and the strengthened  delegation of authority and accountability frameworks are managed within a risk  management approach that balances operational and managerial risks. Managers and  staff at all levels are responsible for identifying and managing risks to the  achievement of their objectives, and the Organization will use risk assessments to  identify weaknesses in its internal controls. The team will conduct Secretariat-wide  risk assessments to identify cross-cutting risks that require a corporate response, and  it will assist in the conduct of project-specific risk assessments and the development  of mitigation strategies for business transformation projects. It will also report  regularly to the Management Committee, which serves as the risk committee for the  Secretariat. Enterprise risk management is an inherent core responsibility of  management. According to the ""three lines of defence"" model, it is essential that risk  management become part of the Organization's ""DNA"" and that managers consider  risks and their potential impact on their ability to achieve strategic and operational  objectives on an ongoing basis as part of their day-to-day core functions. It will be  the responsibility of the team to support them in this process.  146. The Oversight Coordination Section will serve as the Secretariat's central focal  point for engagement with the following oversight bodies: the Board of Auditors, the  Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Joint Inspection Unit and the Independent  Audit Advisory Committee. The team will review the findings and recommendations  of the oversight bodies to identify material weaknesses and reportable conditions. As  accountability for implementing oversight body recommendations will be delegated  to programme managers, the team will track rates of implementation and provide  quarterly reports on implementation and related issues to the Management  Committee, noting where action is not being taken or where a Secretariat-wide  response is required. It will draft related reports of the Secretary-General to the  General Assembly. Its findings and lessons learned will inform policies, future  planning, performance assessments and decisions related to accountability.  147. As focal point for the Joint Inspection Unit, the team will submit reports to the  Department for General Assembly and Conference Management for issuance as General  Assembly documents and prepare consolidated comments of the Secretary-General to  CEB regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the Unit. It will also  review and monitor investigation reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services  jointly with the Office of Human Resources. In addition, it will review and make  recommendations regarding requests for exception to the standards of accommodation  for air travel and will report thereon to the advisory and legislative bodies.        Monitoring and Evaluation Service    148. The Monitoring and Evaluation Service will be responsible for managing  delegation of authority, monitoring and reporting on organizational performance and  developing self-evaluation tools for use across the Secretariat.    A/72/492/Add.2    37/246  18-04386    149. A cornerstone of changing the management paradigm is the Secretary-General's  intention to delegate authority to managers as close to the point of delivery as  possible. While extensive delegations are envisaged, the capacity to support the  responsible exercise of the authority by managers must be in place, and the  Organization will closely monitor how the delegations are used, provide guidance to  managers and, where necessary, provide additional support or take corrective action.   150. The team responsible for managing the delegation of authority, which will be  issued on a functional rather than a personal basis, will produce a consolidated policy  document which clearly sets out delegations of authority and will maintain official  and updated records. The Monitoring of Delegation of Authority Section will work  with the Department of Operational Support to assist managers who have been  delegated authority to ensure that they understand what is expected of them and the  parameters of the authority. The team will be staffed with experts in the various  functional areas. In this way, it will play a preventive role. It will also assist  programme managers through the development of policies and procedures that will  govern all delegations of authority, taking into consideration the Organization's  objectives and structure.  151. In addition, the team will monitor the use of delegated authority on an ongoing  basis to ensure that managers and staff are managing and balancing operational and  managerial risk, complying with regulations and rules and using delegations  effectively as they implement their mandates. Procedures for monitoring and  oversight of the authority delegated, as well as criteria for the withdrawal of the  delegated authority and other corrective actions, will be developed. Monitoring will  be conducted through data analysis, mobile team visits to offices and missions, and  other mechanisms. When, as a result of its monitoring activities, problems are  detected, the team will engage with the relevant offices/staff to ensure an  understanding of the proper protocol and to prevent future non-compliance. When  corrective action is required, the team will alert the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance. Lessons learned from the monitoring  efforts will inform future decision-making and policy revisions.  152. The team will also monitor the segregation of duties across all the functional  areas within the Organization to ensure that the required degree of internal control is  maintained. It will define procedures for monitoring the system of segregation of  duties, outline possibilities for increased ICT system controls and prepare and  implement an internal monitoring schedule.  153. The team will also have a management review function and will identify  activities/areas of the Organization that require tests of compliance with relevant  regulations and rules, either at the policy level (e.g., compliance with the Financial  Regulations and Rules and the Staff Regulations and Rules) or at the organizational  unit level (e.g., in a peacekeeping mission or a regional commission) and assess the  effectiveness of the internal controls in place to evaluate the level of compliance  and/or deter non-compliance.  154. The Organizational Performance Measurement Section will conduct regular and  systematic monitoring of progress towards the key indicators identified in the senior  managers' compacts. The team will also provide substantive support to the  Management Performance Board and will coordinate the senior managers' compacts  and related performance assessments. It will report the results, both at the individual  level and in aggregate, to the Management Performance Board and the Secretary- General. The results will inform decisions regarding accountability, support  continuous improvement and identify systemic weaknesses that require a corporate- level response.  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  38/246    155. Starting with the 2020 programme budget cycle, the team will analyse and  capture the main findings and trends in the performance of individual programmes,  as reflected in part II of the sections of the programme budget, and report on the main  organizational performance trends in the foreword and introduction to the programme  budget. The Section will also monitor the implementation of the programme of work  for the peacekeeping budgets. It will strengthen related practices for assessing and  reporting on programmatic performance, an area that is currently self-assessed by  managers and not independently verified. It will also provide substantive servicing to  the relevant intergovernmental meetings.  156. The Secretariat has long suffered from a lack of capacity, in terms of both  resources and expertise, for conducting proper self-evaluations of its programmes and  activities. As the ability to regularly and professionally evaluate work is essential to  effective results-based management, the Evaluation Section  will provide  methodological support and skills development to staff Secretariat-wide, help draft  terms of reference for self-evaluations, and manage and/or provide quality assurance  for self-evaluation activities on behalf of departments and offices that might require  assistance. As part of this support, the team will prepare and maintain a roster of  professional evaluators who can be hired to conduct evaluations on behalf of  departments that lack in-house expertise.   157. In direct support of results-based management, the team will support  programme managers in their efforts to take self-evaluation results and lessons  learned into consideration in the preparation of the programme budget and  peacekeeping budgets. The team will ensure that the results of self-evaluation  exercises and lessons learned are made public.        Analytics and Project Management Service    158. A primary goal of the Secretary-General's reform agenda is to ensure that the  Secretariat delivers the vital mandates entrusted to it with maximum economy,  efficiency and effectiveness. With the implementation of Umoja, the Secretariat now  has integrated performance data across the entire Organization. The Analytics and  Project Management Service will continuously mine and analyse the data from Umoja  and other enterprise systems and communicate its findings regarding patterns, trends  and areas of strength and weakness to relevant stakeholders, both internal and external  to the Secretariat. Drawing on input from accountability and compliance reviews,  external review bodies and evaluations, it will systematically identify opportunities  to modernize and transform business practices and will have a robust, standing project  management capacity to ensure that change efforts are designed, communicated and  implemented in an efficient and sustainable manner and according to best practices  in project management. This new evidence-driven change management capacity is  essential to drive the management reform forward and communicate progress and  risks to all stakeholders.  159. The Analytics Section will analyse real-time business data from Umoja and  other enterprise systems and provide trend analyses and other analytical reports, such  as dashboards, to senior management, the Management Committee, individual  departments and the legislative bodies. It will use this data to determine unit costs  and the level of efficiency of services provided and will analyse and recommend ways  to improve the quality of management services through quality assurance exercises.  The findings from these reviews and exercises will inform the development of  strategies and policies by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and decision-making by senior managers across the Secretariat,  including as related to performance and accountability.     A/72/492/Add.2    39/246  18-04386    160. The team will also identify administrative services that require quality assurance  tests and perform such tests to assess if these services and the processes they entail  meet the determined quality standards. Based on its findings, the team will prepare  quality assurance reports that will include information on the strengths and  weaknesses of the services provided, weaknesses in the processes followed for the  provision of such services and recommendations for improvement.  161. The Business Transformation and Project Management Section will help the  Organization to continuously improve and ensure that its business model is aligned  with evolving mandates and changing operational environments. It will develop and  continually refine strategies based on anticipated client needs. As the Organization is  considering and designing business transformation initiatives, it must have a long- term view and ensure that it can sustain the new way of working and that the new  practices will not be out of date within a short period of time. It will take a future- oriented approach and will ensure that transformative projects do not simply aim to  improve on what the Organization is currently doing, but find ways of doing things  differently. The team will monitor new trends, such as the effect of artificial  intelligence on the workforce, and will proactively identify opportunities to innovate.  It will keep abreast of industry best practices but will also ensure an ongoing focus  beyond existing ways of doing business.   162. The team will also play a project management role and will coordinate the  Secretariat's portfolio of major transformation projects. It will ensure that the projects  are designed, communicated and implemented according to best practices in change  management, including the training required for staff leading such projects, and that  the unique requirements of field missions are carefully considered. It will also provide  project and operations management training and guidance and, in a collaborative  effort with the Department of Operational Support, will support departments in any  structural or process changes they may need to undertake in responding to new  mandates.        Secretariat of the Advisory Committee on Procurement and the Property  Survey Board        Advisory Committee on Procurement    163. The Headquarters Committee on Contracts will become the Advisory  Committee on Procurement. The Committee will support officials to whom  procurement authority has been delegated and the Assistant Secretary-General for  Supply Chain Management in their accountable exercise of procurement authority by  providing advice on the award of contracts for goods and services. As the Committee  serves an important compliance function, it is proposed that the secretariat of the  Committee -- which currently resides within the Office of the Under-Secretary- General for Management -- be located within the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division to maintain the independence of the Committee and avoid  potential conflicts of interest.        Property Survey Board    164. The Headquarters Property Survey Board will become the Property Survey  Board. The Property Survey Board and local boards established in locations away  from Headquarters will provide written advice to delegated officials with respect to  the disposal of surplus, unserviceable or obsolete property, plant and equipment,  inventories and intangible assets of the United Nations, as well as with respect to the  loss, damage or impairment of such items or other discrepancies involving such items.  The Property Survey Board will advise on the causes of loss or damage to United  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  40/246    Nations property and the degree of negligence, if any, and potential financial recovery  from staff members and other officials.        Secretariat of the Vendor Review Committee    165. This team will serve as the secretariat of the Vendor Review Committee, which  is an internal body that reviews applications to the register of vendors that do not  meet the registration criteria; complaints from requisitioners and/or other United  Nations staff against vendors who were alleged to have failed to perform in  accordance with the terms and conditions of contracts awarded; and proposals for  special approval of vendors recommended by the Procurement Division.        VII. Department of Operational Support       166. Under the new management paradigm, the Department of Operational Support  exists to support the objective of effective mandate delivery, and will do so through  the provision of operational advisory services to clients, support for the  implementation of decisions and, in exceptional cases, exercise of delegated authority  on behalf of clients across the Secretariat. In addition, the Department will provide  dedicated operational support to departments and offices located at Headquarters in  New York.        A. Office of the Under-Secretary-General       167. The Under-Secretary-General will be responsible for all activities of the  Department of Operational Support. The Under-Secretary-General will co-chair the  Management Client Board jointly with the Under-Secretary-General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance, as reflected in paragraph 47 above.  168. The Office of the Under-Secretary-General will consist of a front office to be  established through the redeployment of the front office of the Under-Secretary- General for Field Support as well as a Performance and Analytics Section, an Audit  Response and Boards of Inquiry Section and an Environment Section.        Performance and Analytics Section    169. The Performance and Analytics Section will oversee the operational  performance of all units within the Department of Operational Support and support  decision-making by senior management using custom analytics products that will  track operational performance throughout the Secretariat. These will include the  annual global client satisfaction survey, regular reports on operational performance  and analytics support to specific initiatives, such as peacekeeping reviews. In  addition, the Section will identify opportunities for operational enhancement and  capitalize upon those opportunities, in collaboration with stakeholders, through  continuous improvement of business processes and operational guidance. Because of  the need to strengthen a data-driven approach to operationally support effective  mandate implementation, it is proposed that the Performance and Analytics Section  be established through augmentation of the existing Programme Implementation  Coordination Team in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Field Support,  with additional performance and analytics capacity redeployed from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support and the Field Personnel Division.      A/72/492/Add.2    41/246  18-04386        Audit Response and Boards of Inquiry Section    170. The Audit Response and Boards of Inquiry Section will be responsible for  coordinating, developing and preparing responses to reports of United Nations  oversight bodies for the Department of Operational Support, as well as the  Department of Peacebuilding and Political Affairs and the Department of Peace  Operations; for following up on the recommendations of boards of inquiry in the field;  and for providing administrative support to boards of inquiry convened at  Headquarters. It is proposed that this Section be established through the redeployment  of the existing Audit Response and Boards of Inquiry Section from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support.        Environment Section    171. The Environment Section, which was established in the Office of the Under- Secretary-General for Field Support pursuant to General Assembly resolution 71/295,  is currently responsible for supporting the implementation of the environmental  sustainability management framework in peace operations by providing operational  support, guidance and technical assistance. The Assembly, in its resolution 72/219,  endorsed the action plan for integrating sustainable development practices into  Secretariat-wide operations and facilities management. It is proposed that the Section  be moved to the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support and  to expand its scope to encompass the entire Secretariat, drawing upon the extensive  experience it has gained through its support to peacekeeping operations in the  management of environmental impact and associated risks, while continuing to  leverage the expertise of the United Nations Environment Programme.        B. Office of Support Operations      172. The Office of Support Operations will support clients through the provision of  guidance and advisory services, direct assistance where capacity may be weak or  non-existent, capacity-building, process improvements and optimization, and  operational performance reviews. The Office of Support Operations will consist of  the Capacity Development and Operational Training Service, the Human Resources  Services Division and the Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and  Health Division.        Office of the Assistant Secretary-General    173. It is proposed that the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General for Support  Operations be established through the redeployment of resources of the Office of the  Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support, given that the existing office -- by  virtue of its current role supervising the four divisions of the current Department of  Field Support -- already has a cross-functional perspective of resource management  and performance.        Capacity Development and Operational Training Service    174. The Capacity Development and Operational Training Service will assist clients  in building and improving the capacities needed to accountably exercise delegated  authority, including structures and business processes to better integrate resources,  accountability and programme delivery in line with priorities. The Service will consist  of two teams: an Operational Training Section and a Business Processes and Systems  Support Section. In addition, seven posts from the current Policy, Evaluation and  Training Division, consisting of three posts from the Knowledge Management and  Guidance Team and four posts from the Integrated Training Service, will become part  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  42/246    of the Capacity Development and Operational Training Service, but will be embedded  in the Policy, Evaluation and Training Division in the new Department of Peace  Operations.  175. The Operational Training Section will consist of 5 posts from the Field  Personnel Division and 14 posts from the Capacity Development Section of the Field  Budget and Finance Division. It will be responsible for delivering training specific to  operational support to ensure that clients have the capacities and knowledge needed  to comply with organizational standards and policies.  176. The Business Processes and Systems Support Section will be responsible for  developing the processes and structures by which policies will be implemented across  the Secretariat and will work with other stakeholders to ensure that these are reflected  in enterprise systems. It will also provide training on Inspira, Umoja and other  business applications related to resources management. The Section will provide  support across all Secretariat entities to help ensure consistency in the execution of  processes and to ensure that the processes continue to meet the requirements of all  clients. The proposed staffing of the Section is based on assumptions concerning the  number of service requests that will be received each year based on the workload for  similar functions currently performed by the Field Personnel Division of the  Department of Field Support to support field missions. In order to address gaps in  support requirements that cannot be met because of limited resources, service-level  agreements with offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and others  will be concluded to meet training requirements in this area and to make good use of  existing learning centres in those entities.        Human Resources Services Division    177. In the proposed concept, human resources functions will be divided between the  new departments, with strategy, policy and compliance to be located in the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and all operational  support to be located in the Department of Operational Support. The Human  Resources Services Division in the Office of Support Operations will focus on short- to medium-term human resources requirements of clients, from process development  through service delivery, with the aim of avoiding the delays and redundancies that  currently exist.        Staffing Service    178. The Staffing Service, which will be established through the consolidation of  staffing functions in the Field Personnel Division of the Department of Field Support  and the Strategic Planning and Staffing Division of the Office of Human Resources  Management, will provide expertise and develop processes in the areas of staffing,  testing and examinations, operational workforce planning and organizational design  and management across entities. This will facilitate a holistic approach to operational  workforce planning with client entities during budget cycles. The integrated approach  will enable the Service to provide guidance on organizational design and staffing  structures in the context of the planning process for new entities and entities in  transition, review staffing against models and benchmarks on a regular basis and link  the operational and evolving needs of clients with staffing programmes to anticipate  vacancies and required skills/potential applicants, while ensuring consistency across  all supported entities.  179. The Service will, inter alia, develop recruitment processes for entities with  delegated authority; facilitate recruitment for entities without delegated authority;  manage rosters across all job families; ensure an integrated approach to the use of the  various staffing modalities available within the Secretariat, such as job openings,    A/72/492/Add.2    43/246  18-04386    generic job openings and recruitment from rosters; develop tools and processes to  help entities meet targets related to the effectiveness and efficiency of the recruitment  process, including with regard to gender, geographical and troop- and police- contributing country representation; develop staffing models and procedures for rapid  deployment, start-up and crisis situations; administer the young professionals  programme and the managed reassignment programme; manage the submission of  positions to the Senior Review Group and subsequent approval by the Secretary- General; advise client entities with regard to organizational design and staffing  structures; and provide guidance in the application of standards of classification and  organization management for newly established or changing functions.  180. The proposed level of staffing for the Service resulting from the consolidation  of staffing functions currently split between two departments, when combined with  simplified policies and processes, will allow the Service to better handle its heavy  workload, particularly in the area of roster management. At its current level of  staffing, the Field Personnel Division is able to refresh only 30 to 40 of the 450 rosters  each year. The proposed level of staffing will allow for additional generic job  openings to be managed each year, providing more opportunities for internal and  external candidates alike to be rostered, particularly in job families with evolving  requirements or where the number of candidates is insufficient, and ensuring focus  on gender and geographic distribution.        Operational Support and Advisory Service    181. The Operational Support and Advisory Service will serve as a primary entry  point and point of contact for clients for services not within the scope of the global  service delivery model and the shared service centres. The Service will provide the  full spectrum of consistent, standard and timely advisory services to senior managers  in the exercise of their delegated authorities. When clients require advice on the  exercise of their delegated authority, their business partners will be their first point of  contact. The advisory capacities within the Department of Operational Support will  serve as a resource for business partners. For cases requiring exceptional policy  clarification, the Department of Operational Support will seek the guidance of the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   182. For those transactional services within the scope of the global service delivery  model, the primary entry point for clients will be the shared service centres. The  Operational Support and Advisory Service will also help identify capacity-building  requirements to strengthen the ability of entities to exercise delegated authority.  Furthermore, the Service will provide dedicated advice to managers on the application  of policies and processes in consultation with local business partners. Such advice  will reduce the likelihood of mistakes in administrative decisions that could lead to  cases under the formal and informal system of administration of justice. With the  provision of consistent, clear advice relevant to the specific context of client entities,  managers will be able to make better and faster decisions, thereby allowing them to  devote more time to programme and mandate delivery and to meeting the expectations  of Member States.   183. Services to be provided by the Operational Support and Advisory Service  include advice on the implementation of the Staff Regulations and Rules and policies,  including on the authority delegated to clients; guidance and support in the  development of entity-specific human resources strategies and associated  implementation plans, where requested; analysis of client performance to identify  requirements for human resources capacity-building; feedback on and identification  of requirements for continuous process improvements and adaptation to policies and  processes based on operational requirements and trends; support to managers related  to formal and informal conflict resolution, including advice to clients related to the  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  44/246    formal and informal system of administration of justice; support for transactional  services delivered by shared service centres; and assistance in the development of  recruitment strategies and plans. Operational trends and requirements will be fed back  into the review by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance  of policies, the Staff Rules and the regulatory framework. In addition, the advice to  clients will help identify capacity-building requirements and areas where further  simplification or additional policies are required for the field.        Non-Staff Capacities Unit    184. A dedicated Non-Staff Capacities Unit will provide support to managers and  business partners in the use of non-staff personnel, such as consultants, government- provided personnel and United Nations Volunteers, to ensure compliance with the  relevant General Assembly resolutions. The dedicated unit will help clients to obtain  the capacities necessary to deliver their mandates, while ensuring adherence to the  policies and procedures applicable to the use of non-staff capacities. The proposed  level of staffing is required because while the use of non-staff personnel has increased  in recent years, no dedicated capacity currently exists for this function. A dedicated  capacity will also facilitate better coordination with Member States on issues related  to personnel contributed by their Governments under the non-staff modality and  ensure that such capacities are established in accordance with the mandates of the  General Assembly.        Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and Health Division    185. The responsibility for occupational safety and health is currently spread across  multiple departments within the Secretariat. The resulting lack of clarity in the  division of responsibilities affects the critical functions of health service  management, occupational safety and provision of medical support. The current  fragmentation can be addressed by combining existing operational capacities into an  integrated capacity within the Department of Operational Support. It is therefore  proposed to establish a Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and Health  Division through the consolidation of the existing Medical Services Division in the  Office of Human Resources Management in the Department of Management and  related functions currently shared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and  the Department of Field Support, namely, the Field Occupational Safety and Risk  Management Officer in the Office of the Chief of Staff and the HIV/AIDS Unit in the  Policy, Evaluation and Training Division.   186. The Division, which will be led by a director, will be consist of two main  functional areas: occupational safety and health and health systems administration.  The occupational safety and health component, which will be overseen by the Deputy  Director of the Division, will be responsible for occupational safety; occupational  health, including clinical services, travel medicine and health promotion; mental  health and well-being; and medical emergency response. This component will work  closely with the Department of Safety and Security in areas of common concern,  including critical incident stress management. The health systems administration  component, which will be overseen directly by the Director of the Division, will be  responsible for clinical standards and oversight, including hospital assessments;  health workforce management, including credentialing; and technical review of  compensation claims from uniformed personnel.        C. Office of Supply Chain Management      187. The Office of Supply Chain Management will bring together the logistics and  procurement capabilities currently in the Department of Field Support and the    A/72/492/Add.2    45/246  18-04386    Department of Management to create a single entity to manage the integrated end-to- end supply chain. The current provision of support and services to clients is reactive  and fragmented, with multiple interdepartmental handover points, which contributes  to delays in the delivery of goods and services. In line with the introduction of supply  chain management in the Department of Field Support and the related restructuring  of the Logistics Support Division, as approved by the General Assembly in its  resolution 71/295, this approach will be enhanced by consolidating procurement,  logistics and enabling functions under a single management, with the aim of providing  more agile, responsive, efficient and effective client-oriented services. Key planning  functions will include anticipating client requirements through demand planning and  forecasting; identifying appropriate sourcing options through global source planning  utilizing relevant logistics and procurement expertise; and planning, consolidating  and contracting freight and passenger services for delivery at the right time to the  right place. The strengthening and modernizing of the technical and commercial  aspects of the sourcing process through category management will be at the core of  ensuring that clients receive the right goods and services of the right quality for the  right cost in the right quantity and at the right time.   188. The aim of the alignment of procurement and logistics with an end-to-end  supply chain approach is to strengthen collaboration and seamless coordination  between the two functions, while maintaining the fundamental principles of public  procurement, including best value for money; fairness, integrity and transparency;  effective international competition; and the interest of the Organization. While  providing timely, effective and efficient services to clients, the Office will also ensure  the maintenance of effective checks and balances and the segregation of  responsibilities with respect to the commercial and technical aspects of the sourcing  process and ensure good stewardship over public funding.  189. The proposed structure also builds on measures taken since 2008 to address the  requirements of field missions, such as the establishment of the global high-value  contracts essential for mission operations; enhancement of accountability and the  delegation of authority, while strengthening internal control mechanisms; improved  sourcing, including further enhancement of business opportunities for vendors from  developing countries and countries with economies in transition; improved  information technology systems; comprehensive training programmes; and the  introduction of a compliance monitoring programme. The success of the compliance  monitoring programme in missions was acknowledged in 2013 by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services, which recommended that the programme be expanded to  include offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and tribunals.  190. The Office of Supply Chain Management will encompass the Logistics  Division, the Procurement Division, the Uniformed Capabilities Support Division and  the Enabling Section, which will support operations through the provision of  operational reporting, business intelligence, vendor outreach and performance  management, as well as through the establishment of baselines and the monitoring of  key performance indicators. The Uniformed Capabilities Support Division will  consolidate the functions currently split between the Department of Field Support and  the Department of Management that support the generation, deployment and  reimbursement of formed military and police units to United Nations peace  operations.   191. The Office will implement the supply chain management blueprint first  promulgated by the Department of Field Support in October 2016 and updated in  December 2017 in consultation with the Department of Management as a key strategic  partner. The blueprint includes integrated end-to-end supply chain management  processes with clearly defined functions, roles and responsibilities; offers different  supply chain solutions for different situations, requirements and challenges; provides  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  46/246    infrastructure, technology and resource solutions, including human resources  solutions and the skills necessary to support and enable the supply chain management  processes; and includes a strong performance management framework to measure,  monitor and manage the supply chain to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. The  blueprint will continue to be updated in order to reflect changes and refinements,  taking into account lessons learned, feedback from clients, global best practices and  recommendations by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and oversight bodies.  192. The Office of Supply Chain Management will introduce category management,  in which both technical and commercial teams will work closely to improve the  sourcing process but retain their respective functional reporting lines to ensure  segregation of duties. Category management is the cross-functional management of  goods and services throughout their life cycles, including the gathering of  requirements, sourcing, deployment and disposal, taking into consideration the total  cost of ownership and optimizing long-term value for the Organization.   193. The operational aspects of the integrated supply chain will be enabled by Umoja  Extension 2, which will provide new capabilities for demand planning, supply  network planning, transportation management, and tracking and tracing. With the  deployment of these four supply chain modules under Extension 2, the Organization  will have the visibility over the various process stages necessary to efficiently and  effectively manage the end-to-end supply chain and report on its performance.  Furthermore, accountability and the segregation of duties will be supported through  the assignment of transactional roles.        Office of the Assistant Secretary-General    194. The Assistant Secretary-General will be responsible for all of the activities of  the Office of Supply Chain Management and its administration and management. The  Assistant Secretary-General will provide leadership and direction relating to the  implementation and coordination of the organizational entities which together form  the Organization's integrated supply chain and uniformed capabilities support.   195. The proposed integrated supply chain management approach will allow the  Organization to deliver well-managed and agile solutions to all clients and be more  proactive by planning globally based on consolidated requirements and will provide  better visibility of operational needs.   196. It is proposed that the new Office of the Assistant Secretary-General for Supply  Chain Management be created from the existing Office of the Assistant Secretary- General for Central Support Services.        Aviation Safety Team    197. The Aviation Safety Team, which consists of aviation safety experts reporting  directly to the Assistant Secretary-General, will oversee all matters related to United  Nations aviation operations, including aircraft utilized for personnel and cargo  movements and the official travel of staff. The Team will set standards, processes and  procedures for aviation safety in line with international standards and United Nations  requirements, monitor safety in operations, assess safety risks and conduct safety  assurance activities. The Team will also provide technical oversight for aviation  safety staff in field missions and be responsible for capacity-building through training  and awareness-raising. As part of its responsibilities, the Team will support sourcing  of United Nations aviation service vendors and liaise with national authorities, troop- contributing countries and partner organizations.      A/72/492/Add.2    47/246  18-04386        Enabling Section    198. The Enabling Section will report directly to the Assistant Secretary-General and  provide a single set of performance management metrics, reporting and guidance to  serve the technical and commercial interests of the Office and its clients. The  Enabling Section will establish a performance management framework, including  baseline business intelligence, operational reporting and key performance indicators  to measure the overall health of supply chain management; review supply chain  performance to advise senior management on challenges, achievements and the  identification of further enhancements; assist with vendor registration and outreach  programmes through the organization of dedicated, multi-agency business seminars  with a strong focus on the least developed and developing countries; and develop  operational guidance and best practices on supply chain management for all clients.        Logistics Division    199. The Logistics Division will perform a central role in the implementation of end- to-end supply chain management. It will provide direction and advice on logistical  matters, monitor and assess the delivery of strategic transportation and support  services and direct the delivery of transportation and specialist support services in the  functional areas of air transport, ground transport, engineering, medical and supply,  inclusive of fuel, rations and general supplies and security equipment. The Division  will also perform and lead global integrated supply chain planning functions to  facilitate global demand, source and delivery planning across all technical areas  within its functional scope. The Division will consist of a Supply Chain Planning  Service, a Sourcing Support Service, an Air Transport Service and a Movement  Control Section.        Office of the Director    200. The Office of the Director will provide leadership and direction to the various  services, sections and units within the Division and effective coordination with clients  and other interlocutors and stakeholders. The Office of the Director will be  responsible for providing overall advice and guidance on logistical matters and  monitoring and assessing the delivery of strategic transportation and support services.  The Office will be responsible for supervising the functions of all services and  sections within the Division to ensure the timely provision of logistics support to all  clients through the timely development of global plans for demand, source planning  and delivery; ensuring that category managers are working closely with clients to  provide customized solutions; and ensuring that the technical specifications of  specialist needs of the clients are comprehensive and properly defined and that clients,  including Member States, in particular troop- and police contributing countries, are  provided with timely advice and support, including on the transport of dangerous  goods during deployment of contingents to the field missions.        Supply Chain Planning Service    201. The Supply Chain Planning Service will be responsible for developing and  managing a global plan for demand forecasting, source planning and delivery through  the identification and assessment of the needs of all clients across all Secretariat  entities. The responsibilities of the Service will include, inter alia, establishing and  planning for global, consolidated requirements for all clients; developing a long-term  plan to facilitate forecasting, source planning and delivery; continuously reviewing  and updating medium-term plans to meet client-specific needs; and facilitating  provisions for contingencies. While developing source plans, the Service will work  closely with the Procurement Division to determine the most appropriate sourcing  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  48/246    options, including alternative acquisition methods if they are in the Organization's  best interest, such as letters of assist and cooperation with or use of other United  Nations entities.   202. The Service will be established from the planning functions currently located in  the Supply Chain Planning and Enabling Service of the Logistics Support Division  and will be organized into four teams: the Office of the Chief of Service, the Demand  Planning Section, the Source Planning Section and the Delivery Planning Section.        Sourcing Support Service    203. The Strategic Support Service of the Logistics Support Division, as restructured  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 71/295, will become the Sourcing  Support Service. The Chief of the Service will provide senior-level professional,  technical and operational knowledge to all clients, with a focus on conducting a full  range of activities in support of operations in the portfolio areas of medical support,  engineering, rations, fuel, ground transportation, general supplies and security  equipment. The Service will work in partnership with the Procurement Division to  establish systems contracts that best serve the interests of all clients for the relevant  portfolios.  204. In implementing an end-to-end supply chain, the Service will adopt a category  management strategy jointly with the Procurement Division to benefit from the  combined technical and commercial expertise available. A holistic approach will be  taken to the acquisition process, with access to market intelligence, close liaison and  communication with clients and the ability to leverage the latest technologies to adopt  innovative approaches to providing effective and efficient support to all clients.  Furthermore, the adoption of a category management approach and improved  specifications and source planning will reduce risk in the supply chain and increase  overall value in the delivery of goods and services because the Service will be fully  informed of market trends and technological innovations.        Movement Control Section    205. The Movement Control Section, which will be transferred from the Logistics  Support Division, will continue to provide for the strategic air lift of military and  police personnel and contingent-owned equipment and will provide advice to troop-  and police-contributing countries on the movement of their contingents and the  readiness of cargo, including the movement of dangerous goods. With the  establishment of a strong delivery planning capacity, the Section's role will be  expanded to include the movement of United Nations-owned equipment. The  Movement Control Section will also be responsible for establishing global, regional  and country-specific (where necessary) freight-forwarding and other transportation- related contracts for United Nations equipment.        Air Transport Service    206. There will be no change in the functions and responsibilities of the Air Transport  Service. The Service will continue to provide aviation support, including for  unmanned aerial systems, to all Secretariat entities through the timely establishment  of the required contracts, in coordination with the Procurement Division, and will  provide management support to all clients to enhance cost-effectiveness and  efficiency of aviation operations. As approved by the General Assembly in its  resolution 71/294, the Strategic Air Operations Centre will continue to report to the  Chief of the Air Transport Service. The Service will be responsible for providing  aviation sourcing support, including for unmanned aerial systems, by developing  technical specifications, statements of requirements, modalities of long-term versus    A/72/492/Add.2    49/246  18-04386    short-term sourcing and letters of assist versus commercial sourcing, along with  contracting and invitations to bid versus requests for proposals, to ensure that clients'  needs are met with the most appropriate services in the most cost-effective and  efficient manner. The Service will also be responsible for improving the management  and operations of United Nations aviation support, including by determining aviation  requirements, analysing spending and utilization, and exploring new ways of  fulfilling client requirements, including through standby arrangements and sharing  within the Secretariat. This will be achieved through the provision of guidance to  ensure the right configuration of air assets, infrastructure and services in order to  facilitate the execution of mandated tasks, while ensuring that contracted services  comply with the requirements of the United Nations and the International Civil  Aviation Organization Standards and Recommended Practices. The Service will also  provide dedicated air transportation support during the start-up, sustainment,  transition and liquidation phases of missions; facilitate the planning and  implementation of training courses, workshops and seminars for the development of  aviation specialists; and establish operational guidance to support the effective and  efficient delivery of capabilities from both commercial providers and Member States.   207. The Service will work closely with the Supply Chain Planning Service to  identify client requirements, coordinate with the Procurement Division to ensure that  requirements are properly met and to jointly negotiate with Member States on letters  of assist, and engage with client entities to ensure that the Service effectively and  efficiently meets their requirements.        Procurement Division    208. The Procurement Division will perform a key role in the implementation of end- to-end supply chain management. The current Procurement Division will be  integrated into the Office of Supply Chain Management, together with the Logistics  Division, to enable a faster, less fragmented and more responsive acquisition process  and to enhance communication with clients and stakeholders. The alignment with the  Logistics Division will promote holistic client orientation and the delivering of results  as a team. Closer collaboration in the planning stage will also allow visibility with  respect to client requirements from the beginning.  209. Bringing together the procurement and logistics sourcing functions into the  same Department and Office will improve and strengthen cooperation between areas  of technical and commercial expertise to provide more agile and effective support to  clients, with the necessary safeguards to maintain segregation of duties,  accountability and risk levels. Core procurement functions, such as solicitation  exercises, commercial evaluations, recommendations of qualified offers and contract  administration, will remain independent of the requisitioners to ensure compliance  with the Financial Regulations and Rules and associated internal controls. Each  person's roles will be clearly mapped in Umoja in line with his or her respective  responsibilities in order to help ensure transparency, segregation of duties and  accountability in procurement.  210. A judicious balance will be found between centralized procurement --  benefiting from improved planning, sophisticated technical and commercial expertise  and economies of scale -- and decentralized procurement to enable greater agility on  the part of the clients. Complex and/or strategic goods and services will be procured  centrally, based on requirements, including specifications and statements of work  developed by the Sourcing Support Service in the Logistics Division. Requirements  that are more appropriately sourced locally or regionally, primarily involving low- value procurement, will be procured by the client entities themselves.   A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  50/246    211. Recognizing the importance of enabling integrated and holistic procurement  support that serves the needs of the Secretariat-wide entities, the Procurement  Division will work closely with the Logistics Division to ensure high-quality and  timely services to all Secretariat clients. The Procurement Division, together with the  Logistics Division, will also actively support start-up missions and offices, surge  requirements and humanitarian emergencies through the provision of relevant  expertise, where needed, and the expedited sourcing and delivery of appropriate  goods and services. The two divisions will exercise delegated authority in their areas  of expertise in such cases.   212. The procurement function will consist of the former procurement functions in  the Office of Central Support Services. The procurement functions will be  reorganized to align directly with the category management approach to be  implemented jointly by the Logistics Division and the Procurement Division. Based  on the category management approach, the Procurement Division will ensure  optimized acquisition of key requirements for the Organization. The category  management concept will allow a maximization of economies of scale and provide a  uniform and consolidated acquisition strategy carried out by procurement  professionals who have the required expertise. It will also allow for the enhanced  provision of procurement services to the field and for other clients. Procurement will  continue to be conducted by experienced and qualified procurement staff throughout  the global Secretariat.  213. While most of the high-value, complex and risk-prone procurement will  continue to be conducted through the central procurement function, local offices will  be given the necessary authority and capacity to conduct less complex, time-sensitive,  primarily low-value procurement at the point of delivery. The benefits include quicker  delivery, availability of off-the-shelf spare parts and local maintenance and  simplification of the processes for local requirements, such as leases and utilities.  Individual managers will be held directly accountable for decisions taken. The  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will monitor  performance and adherence to applicable policies, the Financial Regulations and  Rules and the overarching principles of best value for money, fairness, transparency,  integrity and the interest of the Organization. Umoja will provide a robust audit trail  by documenting many of the procurement process steps. Finally, a stringent risk  management framework will be put in place to avoid or mitigate financial, operational  and reputational risks.        Office of the Director    214. The Office of the Director will provide leadership and direction to the various  services, sections and units within the Division and effective coordination with clients  and other interlocutors.  215. The Office of the Director will be responsible for providing overall advice and  guidance on procurement matters, within the Office of Supply Chain Management  and the Department of Operational Support and to smaller procurement offices  worldwide. The Office will be responsible for ensuring that the principles of  procurement are reflected in day-to-day procedures and practices and that proper  internal controls are established at all levels of the Division and for identifying the  levels of risk (operational, financial and fraud). The Office will be responsible for  supervising the functions of all units within the Division to ensure that timely  procurement support is provided for all clients. The Office will also provide support  to all units on complex, innovative projects and projects that include the collaborative  engagement of other United Nations entities.     A/72/492/Add.2    51/246  18-04386    216. In addition, the Office of the Director will provide information to the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance on operational issues  and challenges associated with policy issues and will implement policy guidance from  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance in day-to-day  procurement operations. The Office of the Director will liaise with Member States, as  appropriate, on procurement matters and with the Procurement Network of the High- level Committee on Management to identify procurement synergies with other United  Nations entities.        Aviation, Major Commodities and Regional Service    217. Given the importance of providing client-oriented services for complex, high- value and strategic acquisitions, this Service will use a category management  approach to meet the procurement needs of Secretariat-wide entities in the following  categories: air, road and sea charter; various other aviation-related requirements;  global freight forwarding and logistics services; and turnkey contracts covering food,  fuel, pharmaceuticals, vehicles and other relevant strategic items. The Service will  also provide field-focused support, which will include, but not be limited to, agile  standby resources to expedite procurement for new and expanding missions, and will  leverage the local and regional networks of suppliers in support of various entities.        Real Estate, Information Technology and Corporate Service    218. Using a category management approach, this Service will provide global  procurement services in the following categories: ICT; real estate/construction  projects and infrastructure/engineering services; corporate services, including  consultancies; and critical financial services. This will include the procurement of  global ICT requirements in support of all entities at the local, regional and corporate  levels, while taking advantage of economies of scale and the cost benefits of ICT  governance. The Service will also support the expansion of a global sourcing  approach for ICT, including enterprise applications, migration to cloud computing  and further development of enterprise-wide ICT contracts that will leverage the  buying power of the entire Secretariat. Corporate services will include key  consultancies and training and implementing partners that are used for a wide array  of clients in the Secretariat, both at Headquarters and in the field. They also include  specialized, high-value services such as banking, outside legal counsel and insurance  services. Real estate, engineering and construction form another key area with  meaningful opportunities for rationalization and savings. The Service will provide  services with a global perspective in strategic capital review projects and related  infrastructure and facilities management in support of field missions and the other  Secretariat entities.   219. The Service will coordinate acquisition activities closely with the Logistics  Division, the Office of Information and Communications Technology and other  clients and stakeholders in the Secretariat for the relevant categories.        Uniformed Capabilities Support Division    220. Over 90,000 military and police personnel are currently deployed to United  Nations peace operations. Multiple organizational units across the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field Support, the Department of  Management and, in the case of special political missions, the Department of Political  Affairs, are currently involved in the end-to-end force-generation process. The current  arrangements make it difficult to obtain a holistic view of the support requirements  of and reimbursement to individual contingents and units, and the need to cross  organizational boundaries creates process delays that impede service delivery. It is  therefore proposed that all of the related functions currently residing in the  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  52/246    Memorandum of Understanding and Claims Management Section and the  Reimbursement Policy and Liaison Section of the Field Budget and Finance Division,  the Contingent-Owned Equipment Unit in the Logistics Support Division and the  Financial Information Operations Service in the Office of Programme Planning,  Budget and Accounts be consolidated into a single Uniformed Capabilities Support  Division.   221. The Division will serve as the single point of entry within the Secretariat for  support and reimbursement issues related to military and police contingents, for both  Member States and counterparts within the Secretariat, including the proposed  Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department of Peace  Operations. The consolidation of these functions will address the current  fragmentation in the support aspects of the end-to-end force-generation process and  will allow the Department to better serve the needs of other stakeholders, more  effectively analyse different sources of data to identify and address areas of concern  and more efficiently manage verification and reimbursement. It will also allow for  closer coordination with other units within the Office of Supply Chain Management  that provide support to troop- and police-contributing countries, such as the  Movement Control Section.        Memorandum of Understanding and Reimbursement Policy Section    222. The Memorandum of Understanding and Reimbursement Policy Section will be  responsible for policies and procedures related to the reimbursement to troop- and  police-contributing countries and the verification and control of contingent-owned  equipment, for support to the triennial meetings of the Working Group on Contingent- Owned Equipment and updating the Manual on Policies and Procedures Concerning  the Reimbursement and Control of Contingent-Owned Equipment (see A/72/288) and  for undertaking the quadrennial survey of personnel costs established by the General  Assembly in its resolution 67/261. The Section will also lead the negotiations with  troop- and police-contributing countries in preparing memorandums of understanding  to support the deployment of formed military and police units. It will serve as the  primary focal point for communications between permanent missions of troop- and  police-contributing countries and the Secretariat on questions related to  reimbursement and the memorandums of understanding and subsequent amendments,  where applicable.   223. The establishment of this Section will capitalize on the benefits already evident  from the restructuring of the Memorandum of Understanding and Claims  Management Section and the establishment of the Reimbursement Policy and Liaison  Section approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 69/308. The restructuring  has already allowed the Secretariat to more effectively respond to queries from  Member States regarding reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment and  formed military and police units, to support the work of the Working Group on  Contingent-Owned Equipment and to reduce the number of unsigned memorandums  of understanding, from 64 of 368 in 2015 to 35 of 271 in 2018.        Reimbursement Claims Management and Performance Section    224. The Reimbursement Claims Management and Performance Section will be  responsible for the calculation, analysis and processing of reimbursement to troop-  and police-contributing countries for contingent personnel, major equipment and self- sustainment, as well as death and disability compensation for uniformed personnel. It  will also calculate the wet lease, dry lease and maintenance rates applicable for each  formed unit in accordance with the decisions of the General Assembly and prepare  estimates for the costs associated with reimbursement to troop- and police- contributing countries for inclusion in budget proposals.     A/72/492/Add.2    53/246  18-04386    225. The new Section will also take responsibility for the verification framework for  field missions, ensuring that appropriate processes and robust controls are in place to  measure deployed and serviceable equipment capabilities in field missions. A greater  emphasis on performance information and analysis will also ensure that gaps in  operational performance can be identified and that reimbursement is appropriately  aligned with performance.   226. It is proposed that the Section be established through the consolidation of the  claims-processing and data analysis functions of the Memorandum of Understanding  and Claims Management Section, the Contingent-Owned Equipment Unit and the  Financial Information Operations Service. The consolidation will facilitate the  holistic analysis of reimbursement-related issues and more efficient processing of  claims.        D. Division for Special Activities      227. The Division for Special Activities will oversee a range of specialized and cross- cutting operational capacities. A key element of its responsibilities will be the exercise  of authority on behalf of clients that lack the capacity to do so accountably, including  the offices of special advisers and envoys at Headquarters or in the field, start-up  missions or those whose authorities have been withdrawn. The specific requirements  for different clients will be met through dedicated staffing resources or, particularly  for start-up and surge requirements, through the formation of temporary teams with  subject matter experts drawn from the Office of Support Operations, the Office of  Supply Chain Management and the Office of Information and Communications  Technology. The Division will also include the Operational Planning Service to help  identify and plan for emerging support requirements, the Support Partnerships Service  to coordinate support provided by the Department to non-Secretariat entities and an  operational training and knowledge management capacity.  228. In addition, six support officers that will support, as required, the integrated  operational teams in the regional structure of the peace and security architecture will  report administratively to the Office of the Director in a manner similar to the current  administrative arrangement for the support officers of the Department of Field  Support embedded in the integrated operational teams of the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations.        Resource Planning and Analysis Section    229. The Resource Planning and Analysis Section will take an integrated approach  in working with counterparts across the Department of Operational Support to ensure  that efforts to support client groups across the Secretariat are in line with  organizational priorities and other objectives related to value for money and resource  stewardship. With a focus on data-driven analysis, the Section will work with  counterparts in examining major resourcing drivers and practices within the  responsibilities of the Department of Operational Support to ensure cost-effective  operational support solutions.   230. The placement of the Section within the Division for Special Activities will  enable it to contribute to major operational support efforts and projects across the  Department of Operational Support. The Section will integrate and harmonize  performance and cost analysis across the various pillars of the Department and  measure the impact of the Department's major resource efficiency efforts. It will  provide support and input on best practices and practical, operational solutions to the  various entities within the Department of Operational Support to assist them in the  delivery of support to clients throughout the Secretariat. The Section will also develop  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  54/246    operational resourcing standards to guide the work of the Department of Operational  Support and its client entities and coordinate the input of the Department into strategic  mission reviews and civilian staffing reviews.        Operational Planning Service    231. Planning activities are currently conducted at all levels across the Secretariat in  a non-integrated manner, with fragmented accountability and responsibility for the  disparate planning functions. Furthermore, performance management on planning  functions has been lacking; consequently, its alignment with the strategic goals of the  Organization and compliance with the established planning policies and guidelines  have not been consistent. A dedicated and integrated planning capacity is required to  translate the needs of clients across the Secretariat into effective and efficient support  solutions.   232. Establishment of a new operational planning capacity is proposed to support  client requirements, particularly in the case of new or changing mandates; to provide  technical assistance and advice regarding support-related planning to clients; and to  maintain planning guidelines and standard operating procedures. This capacity will  build on the existing Operational Support Team in the Office of the Assistant  Secretary-General for Field Support, which currently coordinates planning for and  operational support to peace operation start-ups and transitions. It will also  incorporate human resources planning expertise currently resident within the Field  Personnel Division, which will provide support to entities on integrated human  resources planning processes in the context of the establishment of new entities and  the expansion and/or downsizing of existing entities. It will also leverage the  capacities of the Resource Planning and Analysis Section, which will be located in  the same Division, for support on financial planning in such situations. The  integration of these related functions will allow for a more holistic approach to  operational support planning by the Department of Operational Support. To address  planning requirements in peace operations contexts, this capacity would complement  and work closely with the planning capacity within the proposed Office of the Under- Secretary-General of Peace Operations.   233. The Service will work very closely with the Client Support and Special  Situations Section during periods of major activity, such as mission start-up,  transition and liquidation.        Client Support and Special Situations Section    234. The Client Support and Special Situations Section will provide advisory and  support services to entities during start-up, transition, downsizing and liquidation and  assist with overall planning and implementation. It will backstop personnel in affected  entities and provide career support through guidance to managers and staff and  assistance with the placement of downsized staff across the Secretariat. The Section  will review whether existing regulations, rules and policies are fit for purpose in  special situations and liaise with the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance to address challenges and gaps identified. The Section will establish and  maintain dedicated surge capacity support through established standby arrangements  and rosters to facilitate rapid and timely deployment and serve as a focal point for  support to entities in emergency situations and the development of action plans and  after-action reviews, thus increasing emergency preparedness across the Secretariat  and ensuring consistency in operational support in crisis management.  235. During start-up, surge and crisis situations, the Client Support and Special  Situations Section will be augmented temporarily by staff drawn from the Office of  Support Operations, the Office of Supply Chain Management and the Office of    A/72/492/Add.2    55/246  18-04386    Information and Communications Technology, as required, to meet immediate  support requirements until the crisis has ended or resources have been identified or  approved to meet the requirements on an ongoing basis.         Support Partnerships Service     236. In the past decade, the United Nations has increasingly been asked to provide  support to non-United Nations peace operations, including operations mandated or  authorized by the African Union. Currently, the United Nations supports two such  operations -- the African Union Mission in Somalia and the Group of Five for the  Sahel joint force -- in addition to its joint deployment of the African Union-United  Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. In recent years, it also supported the African-led  International Support Mission in Mali and the African-led International Support  Mission in the Central African Republic prior to their transition to United Nations  peacekeeping missions. It is also working to strengthen cooperation with regional  organizations such as the European Union and the Organization for Security and  Cooperation in Europe. Such partnerships are expected to become increasingly  important in addressing challenges to international peace and security, as United  Nations peace operations may not always be the most appropriate or effective  response to particular situations.  237. Support relationships, however, are not a one-way street; there are situations in  which the United Nations will require assistance from regional organizations or  bilateral providers in order to deliver on mandates. These can be standing  arrangements, such as the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement with the United  States of America, or situation-specific agreements, such as the specialist support for  weapons decommissioning for the United Nations Mission in Colombia provided by  the Government of Germany and support provided by the Government of France to  the missions in Mali and the Central African Republic.  238. It is proposed that the remit of the current Headquarters Support Team for the  United Nations Support Office in Somalia, which is currently responsible for  managing the mission support partnership with the African Union, be expanded to  cover all support partnerships in a new Support Partnerships Service. While the  Controller will continue to lead and be the focal point for financial aspects of all  agreements with regional organizations, the Service will be responsible for  maintaining relationships with regional organizations and bilateral support providers,  for negotiating agreements and memorandums of understanding, in consultation with  the Office of Finance and Budget, for monitoring the support provided to or received  from non-Secretariat entities and for coordinating with relevant counterparts within  the Secretariat to address support issues. In order to cover the full range of activities  that will be performed by the new Service, it is proposed that the capacities from the  current Headquarters Support Team be augmented by redeploying two additional P-5  posts to the Service: one post of Senior Support Officer from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary-General for Field Support and one post of Senior Finance Officer  from the Field Budget and Finance Division, given the financial dimensions of many  support agreements.         Integrated operational teams    239. Support officers from the Department of Field Support are currently embedded  in the integrated operational teams in the Office of Operations in the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations to provide expertise on issues pertaining to mission support.  It is proposed that six Support Officers from the Department of Operational Support  be made available to the Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations to provide  the necessary support to the integrated operational teams for peacekeeping operations  in the regional structure of the peace and security architecture, in a flexible manner.   A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  56/246      E.  Division of Administration, New York      240. Administrative services for offices and departments at Headquarters are  currently performed by the Department of Management. It is proposed that, in the  future, location-specific services be delivered by a Division of Administration in New  York in the manner of the divisions of administration at the offices away from  Headquarters. The Division will consist of the Headquarters Client Support Section,  the Headquarters Information and Communications Technology Support Section and  the Facilities and Commercial Activities Service. It will provide building  management and engineering services and information and communications  technology services for all offices and departments at Headquarters. It will also  provide financial and budgetary services and support the management of the human  resources requirements of the Department of Operational Support, the Office of  Information and Communications Technology and the offices in New York that do not  have their own executive offices or administrative units.   241. As the majority of the posts in the Division of Administration will come from  the existing Facilities and Commercial Services Division of the Office of Central  Support Services, it is proposed that the Office of the Director for Facilities and  Commercial Services be reprofiled as the new Office of the Director of  Administration.         Headquarters Client Support Section    242. Executive offices and administrative units support heads of entities and  programme managers in carrying out their financial, personnel and general  administrative responsibilities. Under the new management paradigm, and with the  transfer of transactional functions to shared service centres under the global service  delivery model, executive officers and chiefs of administration across the Secretariat  will have a more strategic business partner role in assisting heads of entities in their  exercise of delegated authorities. At Headquarters, however, many offices are too  small to have their own executive offices and are therefore supported by the executive  offices of other departments.   243. The Headquarters Client Support Section will, in the future, serve as a business  partner for not only the units of the Department of Operational Support located at  Headquarters and the Office of Information and Communications Technology, but  also 13 offices currently supported by the Executive Office of the Secretary-General,  the Executive Office of the Department of Management and the joint Executive Office  of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support.  Altogether, the Section will serve approximately 1,300 posts at Headquarters.         Headquarters Information and Communications Technology Support Section    244. New York Headquarters campus ICT operations will be transferred from the  Office of Information and Communications Technology to the Division of  Administration, as the functions of the latter are limited to the provision of support to  clients in New York. The Section will consist of a Broadcasting and Conference  Support Unit, a Headquarters Service Desk, a Headquarters Local Area Network  Operations Unit, a Headquarters Data Centre Management Unit and a Headquarters  Physical Security Support Unit. These units will directly manage and support the day- to-day ICT operations in New York, including ICT and conference support provided  to Member States, conference webcasting, public wireless networks, the operations  of electronic security systems, turnstiles, access control and surveillance systems. The  Section will also be responsible for disaster recovery and business continuity for ICT  systems at Headquarters.     A/72/492/Add.2    57/246  18-04386    245. The Section will deliver its services in line with the policies and standards set  by the Office of Information and Communications Technology and the overall  operational ICT landscape of the Secretariat.         Facilities and Commercial Activities Service    246. The proposed organizational structure of the Department incorporates all of the  local Headquarters services currently in the Facilities Management Service, with the  exception of the Global Property Management Service. It also incorporates the  components within the Commercial Activities Service, including the Travel and  Transportation Section and the Archives and Records Management Section, with the  exception of the policy capacity in both Sections, as well as the United Nations Postal  Administration.   247. As part of its responsibilities for managing local operations at Headquarters, the  Service will be responsible for the development and maintenance of the  environmental management system for New York and for the reduction of the  environmental impact of Secretariat activities in New York.        VIII. Office of Information and Communications Technology       248. The core goals of the information and communications technology strategy are  to better leverage information and communications technology as a critical enabler,  increase harmonization, and protect the Organization against the increasing risk of  cybersecurity threats. In view of its central role, the Secretary-General proposes to  establish ICT as a unified pillar led by the Assistant Secretary-General, Chief  Information Technology Officer, reporting to the Under-Secretaries-General of both  the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department  of Operational Support. That structure and placement will allow the Organization to  rapidly build upon and leverage gains already made through the implementation of  the ICT strategy and accelerate the implementation of its remaining phases and  elements, especially in ongoing harmonization efforts. The proposed unified structure  will also establish an empowered and agile organization that is ready to leverage  technological innovation, optimize resources and address significant and ever- growing cybersecurity threats.  249. A unified approach will ensure the successful implementation of the global ICT  strategy. The proposed unified ICT pillar will ensure that technology enables the core  work of the United Nations in the areas of peace and security, human rights,  international  law  and  development,  humanitarian  affairs  and  sustainable  development. It will provide expeditious services to all Secretariat clients, in  particular the field operations, through the review and implementation of updates,  policies, standards, governance and tools. This will give all entities access to uniform  delivery of ICT solutions and services as well as improved service delivery through  global, regional and local collaboration.  250. Those structural changes will facilitate nimble ICT operations that are relevant  and positioned for the rapid delivery of solutions. Advances in technology will allow  the Office to fully leverage cloud technologies and deliver under increasing financial  and time constraints. It is also proposed that cybersecurity be linked closely to  operations to ensure that the Organization will be able to respond quickly to current  and future cyberthreats.   251. Meeting cross-functional requirements of the entire Organization and Member  States is a critical requirement and a mainstay of the Secretary-General's reform  efforts. A unified ICT pillar that combines strategic and operational functions will  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  58/246    better serve those critical needs. The Organization's ability to meet all of the  requirements is enhanced when the strategic, policy and compliance functions are  placed closer to the clients and end users, which also strengthens its ability to bring  decision-making closer to the clients, a core objective of the current management  reform proposals.  252. The ultimate objective of the ICT function is to provide improved, more agile  services that address Organizational requirements at the local, regional and corporate  levels, while managing risks and ensuring user satisfaction. Client engagement at all  levels will ensure that ICT services and solutions enable the United Nations to more  effectively and accountably deliver its programmes and mandates. The driving  principle is to focus on client services and innovation for the entire Secretariat. Client  services will be coordinated from the bottom up and from the top down so that there  is local autonomy supported by a governance framework, policies and standards that  work for all.   253. A coherent service delivery model is proposed for the single ICT pillar,  leveraging existing resources and mechanisms and bringing together the various  organizational components in order to concentrate all efforts on effective delivery to  support the Organization in carrying out its substantive and operational work locally  at diverse locations around the world. The model comprises three interlinked but  distinct layers, each with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, as set out below.   254. The first layer encompasses the strategy, direction and global implementation  of activities managed at United Nations Headquarters. The second layer is focused on  supporting local operations through the implementation of globalized technology  solutions supported through the Global Service Centre at Brindisi, Italy, and Valencia,  Spain. The regional ICT framework and the regional technology centres represent and  serve the interests and needs of local offices and field operations by geographical  location. They are responsible to regional client boards, with additional reporting  lines to Headquarters. The regional entities ensure that ICT is close to its clients and  responsive to their needs, while at the same time local offices benefit from  coordinated direction from Headquarters and the leveraging of regional initiatives.  Those two layers exist solely in support of layer three, the tactical layer, comprising  the ICT teams within the local structures, which is focused on the effective delivery  of technology solutions and the provision of support to the local community of end  users.  255. While the three layers act as one technology service delivery mechanism, each  one has direct responsibilities towards each particular entity, its leadership and its  mandate. The structures, mechanisms and governance that dictate the model's internal  and external relationships are critical to its overall effectiveness. They will be aligned  with the proposed Management Client Board for the two new departments and will  be supplemented by regional client boards, service-level agreements with clear key  performance indicators, and additional reporting lines, where relevant. The single ICT  delivery model will lead to standardized delivery of services across diverse entities.  The model is designed for the clear assignment of roles and responsibilities and the  creation of linkages and mechanisms to ensure that services are delivered effectively  across a complex global span of delivery and control.  256. Limitations associated with the organizational and budgetary partition between  peacekeeping and non-peacekeeping activities have been overcome for some ICT  services through the combination of various funding mechanisms, including the  service delivery model, which encompasses directly budgeted services and services  provided to other entities, funded through cost recovery and governed by a mature  and robust service-level management framework. For example, such services as data  centre hosting and storage, connectivity, ICT security and event monitoring are    A/72/492/Add.2    59/246  18-04386    provided to peacekeeping missions as well as to 14 non-peacekeeping entities by the  Global Service Centre at Brindisi and Valencia. Similarly, geospatial information  systems services are provided both to peacekeeping operations and to bodies such as  the Security Council, including its panels of experts, the Executive Office of the  Secretary-General, the United Nations Operations and Crisis Centre and all offices  and departments of the Secretariat. Another example is the global provision of email  and collaboration tools, which are also funded through cost-recovery mechanisms. It  will therefore be necessary to expand on this integrated budgetary funding model  when the unified ICT entity assumes responsibility for the provision of technological  support and services to the entire Secretariat.  257. An important element of the single pillar model is the introduction of  normalized key performance indicators and standardized measures of achievement  that focus on the delivery of ICT support to all entities and respond to client demands.  Services provided through service-level agreements will foster enhanced  comparability, consistency and clarity concerning the performance of ICT operational  services. The indicators can be an efficient tool for measuring the effectiveness of  ICT services. They are also paramount for continuous service improvement, as they  facilitate the identification of areas that require attention or where indicators can be  refined to meet critical targets.  258. Local ICT teams will be empowered and will perform functions in compliance  with policies; governance is intended to further streamline processes using a client- based approach to foster agility. Local operations will include user support,  cybersecurity and risk management, support for local networks and ICT  infrastructure, and the use of innovative technology and the development of solutions  that address local programmatic needs.  259. The Secretariat's future systems will be secure, cost effective, standardized and  supported by interoperable platforms, in compliance with centralized ICT architecture  policies and governance. The Organization will use innovative technology to  accelerate the delivery of solutions, including frontier technologies such as artificial  intelligence and machine learning, to keep pace with rapid technological advances,  together with the evolving needs of the Organization.   260. The unified ICT pillar will provide expeditious services, support and solutions  to all Secretariat clients, in particular the field operations, through the review and  implementation of updates, policies, standards, governance and tools. This will give  all entities access to uniform delivery of ICT solutions as well as improved service  delivery through global, regional and local collaboration. The unified ICT  organization will be responsible for ensuring effective, efficient, coherent and  accountable ICT programmes and services, resource management and compliance  with ICT policies and standards.         Office of the Assistant-Secretary-General, Chief Information  Technology Officer      261. The Assistant Secretary-General, Chief Information Technology Officer, will be  accountable jointly to the Under-Secretary-General for Management, Strategy, Policy  and Compliance and the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support. The  Office of the Assistant Secretary-General will continue to provide strategic direction  and leadership for the implementation of Organization-wide ICT and for planning and  coordinating ICT activities Secretariat-wide, ensuring the effective and efficient  utilization of resources in the modernization of information systems and the  improvement of the Secretariat-wide information and communications services  worldwide to a consistent standard of functionality, quality and reliability. The Office  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  60/246    will set the overall strategic direction and provide enterprise solutions and  infrastructure with a view to achieving coherence and coordination and will support  the reform agenda, which is aimed at strengthening accountability by embedding  accountability mechanisms into enterprise systems. The Office will include  cybersecurity and enterprise programme management teams to strengthen  information security throughout the Secretariat as well as to provide a standardized  approach to the oversight of ICT programmes.  262. Any given ICT solution requires an integrated set of services. For example,  email requires infrastructure, mobile technology, application services and service  desk and cybersecurity support. It is therefore proposed that the ICT units of the  Department of Management and the Department of Field Support be transformed into  three tightly integrated areas: operations support; policy, strategy and governance;  and enterprise solutions, as described below. Those areas will report to the Assistant  Secretary-General, Chief Information Technology Officer. ICT-related activities will  be implemented within a common normative framework, with strong, agile  governance and in accordance with the ICT strategy.        Operations Support Division    263. The Operations Support Division will comprise the Office of the Director, the  Service Operations Service, the Technology Operations Service, the Regional Service  Management Service and the Technology Solutions Section.   264. The Division will be responsible for all ICT operations across the Secretariat,  including field operations. It will develop, manage, monitor and optimize the  infrastructure on which the Organization's global technology solutions, systems and  applications are delivered. This includes the United Nations data centre and the ""one  United Nations"" network. It will manage the platforms on which applications are  developed in a governed, structured and secure manner. It will configure and deliver  in a secure and intuitive manner, products and tools to enable client mobility and  flexibility and to optimize the client's digital experience.   265. By utilizing the regional frameworks, the Division will manage the delivery of  uniform client services across the Secretariat; provide leadership and engagement and  coordinate operations across a diverse Secretariat landscape; support offices and field  missions by simplifying and prioritizing operational compliance and standardization  activities; provide the regional mechanisms for managers and clients to develop and  communicate ICT requirements and formulate and track the implementation of  technologies in support of local goals and objectives; field-test proofs of concept and  pilot initiatives and promote the harmonization and optimization of core activities.   266. The Division will oversee and direct operations at the Global Service Centre  operational hubs at Brindisi and Valencia, provide round-the-clock monitoring of  operations across the Secretariat's ICT landscape from the Network Control Centre  and escalate incidents to appropriate support teams. It will ensure that economies of  scale are leveraged by providing ICT services to other offices on a cost-recovery  basis. The Division will also broker and manage cloud services and activities and  manage operational information security activities. In support of mission/office start- up and expansion, the Division will develop and implement rapidly deployable and  modularized solutions and manage and catalogue ICT services and oversee the  transition of new operational activities into production.  267. As part of the ICT service delivery framework, the Division will manage Unite  service desks and put in place mechanisms and procedures to optimize client  satisfaction, providing a virtual point of entry for clients, and to standardize the  approach to managing incidents and requests for service across entities. The Division  will also ensure visibility of the technology landscape to allow for informed and    A/72/492/Add.2    61/246  18-04386    effective decision-making, ensure that all operational activities are aligned with  enterprise architecture, integrate cross-cutting activities with operations where end- to-end solutions are required and provide non-enterprise field-specific technology  solutions, manage field-specific signals training and staff development programmes,  where applicable, facilitate the preparation and migration of current solutions to cloud  hosting, optimize the impact of the Microsoft Office 365 suite of products and  develop and support the implementation of business intelligence strategies to  facilitate self-service analytics at the local level.         Policy, Strategy and Governance Division    268. The Policy, Strategy and Governance Division will comprise the Director's  office, the Policy and Compliance Service, the Records Management Unit and the  Data Management and Privacy Unit.  269. The Division, in consultation with entities across the Secretariat as well as other  United Nations system organizations, will define, update and provide oversight for  the timely implementation of the ICT strategy, ensuring that ICT initiatives and  services are aligned with the core work of the Organization and that they provide agile  responses to organizational requirements. Innovative technology would be used to  bring about modernization and transformation across all areas and entities.  270. Policies and standards will be established covering infrastructure, hardware,  software and methodologies that will ensure that ICT work is performed in a  consistent manner across the Organization. A normative framework will be  established to facilitate agile and rapid operations within a predefined and  collaboratively agreed framework. This policy framework will minimize the risk of  duplication, achieve economies of scale to contain cost, be conducive to the sharing  of information and solutions and ensure optimal operational support. The  establishment of policies and standards will be done in coordination with entities  across the Secretariat, taking into consideration the rest of the United Nations system,  so as to achieve interconnectivity and promote collaboration.  271. The Records Management Unit will be responsible for establishing policy and  setting standards for the management of the records and archives of the United  Nations, including their use, storage and disposition, as well as public access to them,  will support Secretariat-wide efforts to strengthen and ensure compliance with digital  and physical records management policies and will provide expert advice on digital  record-keeping. The team will also facilitate the integration of records management  into the accountability framework.  272. Data management and privacy are central to ensuring that the information flow  supports operational effectiveness while ensuring privacy and the integrity of  information. As the use of integrated enterprise systems increases, the potential for  information privacy issues to have a negative impact on operations increases as well.  The Data Management and Privacy Unit will establish policies for the management  and handling of data and will monitor compliance to ensure that privacy imperatives  are integrated into technology and data solutions.  273. Governance refers to the design, implementation and continuous adjustment of  mechanisms to ensure that ICT solutions are aligned with the needs, priorities and  standards of the Organization in order to efficiently support the United Nations  programmes of work. This objective is achieved through processes that ensure that  ICT resources are used responsibly, that investments in technology are transparent  and prioritized in alignment with organizational objectives and that the requirements  are addressed in an agile and timely manner. Such processes protect the Organization  from reputational and operational risks by ensuring that the ICT infrastructure,  applications and services are designed, built, maintained and operated in compliance  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  62/246    with United Nations policies and standards. Governance will include such cross- departmental and cross-entity mechanisms as the ICT Executive Committee, the ICT  Board, the Enterprise Project Management Office and the Architecture Review Board,  among others. The representative and adequate participation of clients will be ensured  in the composition of those bodies.        Enterprise Solutions Service    274. The Enterprise Solutions Service will comprise the Office of the Chief, the  enterprise applications centres for the Americas and for Asia and the data modelling  and management team. The Service will carry out the following three main functions:    * Coordinate the governance of overarching ICT systems and solutions to ensure  that the necessary elements, such as an ""app store"", are in place to ensure the  agile development of applications at the appropriate level. The aim is to address  client requirements (at, e.g., the local, regional, departmental or enterprise  level), taking into account the needs and priorities of the Organization and  unique local requirements and to ensure that investments in solutions are  transparent and prioritized accordingly. This will be done together with local  and regional ICT and business teams, which will play a key role in systems  governance.    * Work in close collaboration with clients to design, develop and support  enterprise solutions, which are, by definition, large scale, complex, scalable,  distributed, component based and mission critical in nature. They are designed  to integrate core systems and processes across all areas of the Organization,  bridging silos to facilitate the coordination of work and the delivery of services,  reducing the duplication of effort and information. The functions will include  analysis of client requirements, architecture, design and the development of  standardized solutions that respond to the accelerated pace and dynamic  demands placed on the Organization. It will leverage cutting-edge technologies  and services, such as cloud-based software. By working with regional and local  ICT teams, the Enterprise Solutions Service will take a flexible and agile  approach to the delivery of solutions that comply with policies, standards,  architecture and information security requirements.     * Together with regional and local ICT teams and following business and ICT  governance and policies and standards, the Service will continue to enhance the  quality and availability of data, strengthening and expanding data structures and  data dictionaries and assisting clients with the documentation necessary to  empower them to use a self-service approach to producing and sharing  information.        IX. Global Shared Service Centres      275. Global shared services will be delivered under the overall purview of the Under- Secretary-General for Operational Support and led by the Director, Global Shared  Services, who will oversee the chiefs of the individual shared service centres. The  Director, supported by a team, will ensure quality, build standardization and optimize  resources and costs across global shared services. The Office of the Director will be  responsible for operational monitoring, the optimization of processes performed in  service centres and staff and client training and will include client engagement units,  which will be co-located within one of the shared service centres.  276. The Operational Monitoring Unit will monitor and report on service centre and  staff performance and provide global reporting in line with the performance    A/72/492/Add.2    63/246  18-04386    framework mechanisms, including service-level agreements and key performance  indicators. The Process Optimization Unit will support the continual improvement of  the performance of shared service centres by identifying and managing service  improvement projects and driving process re-engineering and changes, as needed. The  Staff and Client Training Unit will provide consistent training and capacity  development for shared service centre staff and will develop and deliver training for  clients of the shared service centres, particularly during transition periods. The Client  Engagement Unit will deliver clear, timely and relevant communications to  stakeholders through multiple communication channels, including online and print  media and in-person visits. The head of the Unit will be responsible for client  engagement and support across all service centres. The team will work in close  collaboration with the individual shared service centres and with Headquarters to  facilitate effective and efficient shared service operations.  277. More information regarding the Office of the Director and the service centres is  provided in the report of the Secretary-General on the global service delivery model  for the United Nations Secretariat (A/72/801).        X. Revised estimates       278. The present section contains an outline of the programmatic and financial  consequences with respect to the biennial programme plan and priorities for the  period 2018-2019 and the programme budget for the biennium 2018-2019 arising  from the reorganization of the Department of Management and the Department of  Field Support as the new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and Department of Operational Support. In particular, the changes  affecting programme 4, Peacekeeping operations, and programme 25, Management  and support services, of the biennial programme plan and priorities for 2018-2019  and the related sections of the budget, namely, section 5, Peacekeeping operations,  section 29, Management and support services, and subsections 29A to 29E, are  presented. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the resource implications  of the reorganization of the two departments, details of the post and financial  resources proposed to be funded under the support account for peacekeeping  operations, as well as the estimated resources from voluntary contributions, are  included in the tables in the present report. With respect to resources to be funded  under the support account, annex III below provides information on the impact of the  reorganization on post resources, including redeployments, reassignments and  reclassifications, and the associated financial resource requirements for the period  from 1 January to 30 June 2019. Detailed explanations on post and non-post  requirements for the period from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 are presented in the  report of the Secretary-General on the budget for the support account (A/72/790).   279. The changes required in the 2018-2019 biennial programme plan and priorities  and programme budget are set out in table 1.      A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  64/246        Table 1  Modifications required in the biennial programme plan and budget for 2018-2019    Current  Proposed      Section 5. Peacekeeping operations  A.

Programme  4,  Peacekeeping  operations,  will  no  longer  include  subprogramme 5, Field administrative support, or subprogramme 6, Integrated  support services, as the activities of those subprogrammes will be subsumed under  programme 25, Management and support services.  281. The new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will be  responsible for the enterprise resource planning project, the secretariat of the Fifth  Committee and the Committee for Programme and Coordination, the Management  Evaluation Unit, and the finance and budget, human resources, and business  transformation and accountability functions.  282. In addition, under programme 25, the Department will be responsible for  support operations, supply chain management, special activities, administration, New  York, and the Global Shared Service Centres.   283. In order to better present a holistic view of the resources of each department, it  is proposed that the budget fascicles for 2020 and onward for sections 29A to 29G be  prepared at the subsection level. The subsection 29A budget fascicle will include  components 1-4, and the subsection 29B fascicle will include components 1-5.  284. The posts approved for the current Department of Management and Department  of Field Support are proposed to be redistributed, for 2019, to the new Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and Department of Operational  Support. The resulting impacts on the resources for the biennium 2018-2019 of the  current Department of Field Support, under section 5, Peacekeeping operations, and  the Department of Management, under section 29, Management and support services,  are presented in table 2.

A/72/492/Add.2    67/246  18-04386    285. The proposed financial and staffing resources for the new Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and Department of Operational  Support are set out in table 3. The resources presented in tables 2 and 3, as well as in  the rest of the report, exclude 40 posts proposed to be abolished as a result of the  transfer of functions to the Global Shared Service Centres. The total resources  proposed for the centres are presented in the report of the Secretary-General on the  global service delivery model (A/72/801).   286. The reorganization of the Department of Management and Department of Field  Support as the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and  Department of Operational Support will result in the redeployment of 733 posts  funded from the programme budget whose functions will remain unchanged. In  addition, 31 posts funded from the programme budget have been identified whose  functions would change in the new departments and are proposed to be reassigned  accordingly. The details of those posts are presented under each office in the sections  that follow. A vacancy rate of 50 per cent for posts in the Professional and higher  categories and 35 per cent for posts in the General Service and related categories have  been applied to the costing of the 31 posts. In addition, one post (Trades and Crafts)  is proposed to be abolished.   287. As indicated in paragraph 8 above, the Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support will be constituted  from the posts approved for 2019 for the current Department of Management and  Department of Field Support. To facilitate the hiring by programme managers of the  staff required to deliver the benefits of the reorganization, it is proposed that the 5 per  cent reduction in post resources approved by the General Assembly in its resolution  72/261 under sections 29C, 29D and 29E not be applied for the year 2019 to the two  new departments. This proposal is reflected in the cost estimates set out below.  Overall, the reform will entail a reduction in post resources in the amount of  $510,100, which will be reflected in the first performance report for the biennium.

On this basis, the General Assembly is requested to take the following  actions, to take effect on 1 January 2019:    A/72/492/Add.2    191/246  18-04386      (a)  Approve the proposed reorganization of the current Department of  Management and Department of Field Support into the proposed new  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and Department  of Operational Support, as detailed in the present report;    (b)  Approve the proposed new subsections 29A to 29D of section 29,  Management and support services, of the programme budget for the biennium  2018-2019, as presented in table 1 of the present report;    (c)  Approve the related redistribution of posts and non-post resources,  including the redeployments and reassignments of posts, from the current  Department of Management and Department of Field Support into the new  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and Department  of Operational Support, as well as the abolishment of one post (Trades and  Crafts);    (d)  Take note of the reduced requirements under post resources for the  biennium 2018-2019, in the estimated amount of $510,100, which will be  reported in the context of the first performance report for the biennium;    (e)  Approve, in the context of the proposed budget for the support  account for peacekeeping operations for the 2018/19 period, the related  redistribution of post and non-post resources, including the redeployments and  reassignments of posts, from the current Department of Management and  Department of Field Support into the new Department of Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance and Department of Operational Support.

Inventory of strategic, policymaking, compliance, operational and  support activities      1.  The inventory of activities currently performed by the Department of Field  Support and the Department of Management will be provided separately to the  General Assembly on account of its length and format.         B. Analysis of scalability of the proposed Department of  Operational Support      2.  The concept of scalability applies to all activities in the Secretariat to some  degree. The resource requirements of the departments will change on the basis of the  amount of support delivered to clients across the Secretariat, but the relationship  between staffing and support requirements is not linear. Requirements in some  functions, such as those responsible for executive direction, performance  management and analytics, are largely static. For functions that are scalable, resource  requirements often depend on several factors.  3.  For the Department of Operational Support, the staffing of many functions,  particularly those related to service delivery and capacity development, depends on  the number of staff served. Certain functions, such as movement control and  reimbursement claims processing, depend on the number of military contingents and  formed police units deployed. Others, such as examinations and roster management,  depend on a variety of factors such as the number of rosters to update and the number  of applicants for generic job openings. Moreover, the level of support required by all  types of entities is not consistent across the Secretariat; for example, field missions,  because of their decentralized geographical distribution, sometimes in remote  inaccessible areas and often under dangerous and volatile conditions, require  dedicated central backstopping requirements for operational aspects that are not  evidenced in the non-field environment geographical locations. Although scalability  in these functions applies to all organizational units, the fact that volatility in the  number of staff or client entities exists primarily in field operations means that  changes in the level of staffing requirements for these functions will occur primarily  as a result of changes in the number and size of field missions.   4.  It must be noted, however, that the initial level of staffing proposed for the  Department of Operational Support is based primarily on the number of posts  available as a result of the post-neutral exercise of allocating existing resources from  the Department of Field Support and the Department of Management. Whether this  will continue to represent the staffing baseline for the delivery of services to entities  across the Secretariat under a new decentralized paradigm will become clear only  after the new structures have been in place for some time. At the same time, the level  of staffing required in clients will also need to be adjusted not only to ensure that they  have the level of resources required to discharge their responsibilities under the new  paradigm, but also to reflect a consistent approach as to how support functions are  staffed across the Secretariat.         A/72/492/Add.2    203/246  18-04386      C. Mapping of the current and envisaged delegation of authority      5.  The detailed mapping of the current and envisaged delegation of authority will  be provided separately to the General Assembly on account of its length and format.         D. Effect of the establishment of the two departments on the internal  control regime and on the roles of the Assistant Secretary-General/  Controller, the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support  Services and the Assistant Secretary-General/Chief Information  Technology Officer          Assistant Secretary-General/Controller    6.  The internal control system currently in place in the Office of Programme  Planning, Budget and Accounts that governs the transactions that have a financial  impact will evolve to recognize the new segregation of duties between the Department  of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational  Support and the new structure of delegation of authority that will flow from the  Secretary-General to the heads of offices. The implementation of the statement of  internal control will be a self-attestation tool to monitor the effectiveness of the  internal control system that exists to produce the institutional financial reports.        Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services    7.  The post of Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services will no  longer exist, but there will be additional roles created in the new Department of  Operational Support which, if staffed properly, will strengthen the internal control  regime.        Assistant Secretary-General/Chief Information Technology Officer    8.  Based on the recommendations of the Board of Auditors (see A/67/651) and on  the information and communications technology (ICT) strategy (A/69/517), efforts  have been under way to ensure an appropriate balance of operational freedom and  central control. Management reform proposes that the ICT organizations of the  Department of Management and the Department of Field Support be combined to  create a unified and coherent approach to ICT, which is in line with the decisions of  the General Assembly and the imperative to harmonize ICT while supporting  operational agility. The consolidation of ICT will strengthen control by ensuring that  the control regime supports operations and that, concomitantly, operational needs on  the ground inform the control regime. Through this approach, an optimal balance of  control and coherence with operations can be achieved. It is envisaged that the  controls will be established through a consultative process and implemented through  policy, standards and architecture, thereby allowing operations to proceed, provided  that they are undertaken within established parameters.        E. Assessment of the risks, benefits and costs of separating the  strategic, policymaking and compliance functions      9.  The proposal for two departments serving all Secretariat entities is based on the  sound management principles of unity of command and purpose; clarity of roles and  responsibilities; and empowered delegations of authority that are rational, holistic and  decentralized as far as possible within an established risk framework, in which risk  assessment is supported by analytics and individual oversight data and the exercise  A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  204/246    of delegated authority is supported, monitored and designed so that form follows  function. Strategy, policy and accountability functions will be separated from  operations enabler functions. The two departments will serve all entities with  dedicated support in the areas of strategy, policy and compliance, on the one hand,  and operational and transactional services on the other.   10. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance structure will  provide the Secretary-General with not only global best practices in management  strategy and policy but also the oversight necessary to ensure that the delegation of  authority framework is functioning as it should and that the support structures are  delivering the field orientation, client friendliness and agile and nimble services that  the Secretary-General intends to institute.   11.  The Department of Operational Support will serve as the primary client-facing  department, enabling operations by providing guidance and advisory services,  assistance to client entities where capacity may be weak or non-existent, capacity- building, process and enterprise system improvements, operational performance  reviews to improve operational performance and support services to the entire  Secretariat.        Benefits    12. In creating the two departments, the Secretary-General wishes to ensure  improved service delivery, in particular with regard to the entire field architecture.  Analysis conducted by the internal review team on management reform and  subsequently confirmed by the work of the departments has shown that the two- department structure should be retained, albeit with a different division of  responsibilities, one focused on global operations support that is counterbalanced  with a dedicated function focused on governance, accountability, transparency and  quality assurance.  13. Establishing the two proposed departments is expected to yield the overall  benefit of ensuring fast and effective services by, wherever possible, empowering  action and decision-making closer to the point of delivery, based on the rationale that  front-line senior managers are better informed of the ground realities and  requirements for delivery of programme outcomes and mandates than centralized  management. Decentralization of management authority and responsibilities to senior  managers will contribute to addressing the challenges identified in resource  management that have an impact on programme and mandate delivery and enable fair  and full accountability for results. Underpinning this decentralization and alignment  of responsibilities and accountabilities will be strengthened, streamlined and  simplified policies and procedures, clear and segregated roles and responsibilities,  mainstreamed risk management that balances operational and managerial risk, and  information technology and communications infrastructure and capacities that  support sound decision-making and action and enable real-time and transparent  business analytics and monitoring under a robust accountability framework.   14. Once the two departments are established and operational, existing duplication  of effort and identified inefficiencies caused by multiple handover points are expected  to liberate resources to take on the required overarching and strategic issues.        Specific benefits    15. Specific benefits of establishing the two departments include:    (a)  Elimination of overlap in responsibilities between the two departments:  decentralization and elimination of overlap will allow the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance to focus its resources on establishing strategies,    A/72/492/Add.2    205/246  18-04386    developing policies and establishing accountability and compliance frameworks for  the Organization with effective monitoring systems. The Department of Operational  Support, for its part, will be able to focus on operational support and on providing  dedicated advisory services to managers in entities to ensure robust and accountable  decision-making in compliance with rules and regulations;    (b)  Increased efficiency and speed in decision-making at the entity level in  line with immediate operational demands;    (c)  Streamlined policies that will remove unnecessary complexity and  introduce the clarity required to enable prompt and effective action;    (d)  More flexibility in the rules and policies that will account for vastly  different operational environments and tempos across the global Secretariat.        Risks    16. Greater integration, clear linkages, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and  improved governance are required for the new paradigm to improve mandate delivery  and enhance accountability. Also required is the strengthening or development of a  robust delegation of authority framework underpinned by the required streamlined  policy framework, capacity-building where necessary, business intelligence and  analysis to support monitoring and quality assurance, and a risk management  framework that balances operational and managerial risk. Such capacities and tools  are currently lacking in the two existing departments. The two new departments will  need to be carefully engineered in order to ensure that these requirements are met and  reflected in their structures and working methods.   17. In this regard, in order to ensure integration and unity of effort towards meeting  the goals of policy consistency, accountability and operational support effectiveness,  the Executive Senior Management Committee, co-chaired by the Under-Secretaries- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and for Operational  Support, will be established. Serving as a platform for interdepartmental coordination,  the Committee will bring together, on a regular basis, the senior management of both  departments and identify and address cross-departmental priorities and strategic  issues, including those related to the efficient and effective delivery of services to  clients.  18. The establishment of the Management Client Board provides a further standing  mechanism to ensure that feedback from the different types of client entities across  the Secretariat is systematically provided and that their particular concerns and  requirements are taken into account by both departments. Where an operational need  is identified, the Board will also feed policymaking processes.         Costs    19. The Secretary General has confirmed that the management reform proposal is  not intended as a cost-cutting exercise and that the implementation of the reform  proposals is intended to be cost-neutral. Both departments have taken on additional  work over the past years, for example the roll-out of Umoja, and have been operating  on a ""do more with less"" approach. As a result, the scope for further reducing costs is  being increasingly compromised.       A/72/492/Add.2      18-04386  206/246      F. Assessment and lessons learned from the restructuring of the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the establishment of  the Department of Field Support      20. Shortly after taking office, the former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon sent a  letter to the President of the General Assembly on sustaining the capacity of the  Organization to manage and sustain peace operations (A/61/749). The letter drew  attention to the fact that the existing structure in the Secretariat to support  peacekeeping operations was not sufficient to meet the demand for and complexity of  peacekeeping operations. The letter indicated that measures ""to better align authority,  responsibilities and resources ... with a view to facilitating clearer performance  accountability"" would lead to ""better planning, faster deployment and a more  responsive system of support"" and ""would also lead to the more effective, efficient  and transparent use of resources placed by Member States at the Secretariat's disposal  to implement legislative mandates"".   21. In its resolution 61/279, the General Assembly endorsed most of the  recommendations of the Secretary-General (see A/61/858, A/61/858/Corr.1,  A/61/858/Add.1, A/61/858/Add.1/Corr.1 and A/61/858/Add.2) and established the  Department of Field Support. However, more than 10 years after the restructuring of  the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the establishment of the Department  of Field Support, most of the concerns that prompted the submission of the letter  remain valid at present. This is why the Secretary-General proposed a shift in the  management paradigm in the Secretariat and why the present comprehensive report  has been submitted.   22. Two reports on the implementation of resolution 61/279 (A/62/741, A/63/702  and A/63/702/Corr.1) were submitted to the General Assembly, as were the results of  an audit by the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the structure for managing  and sustaining peacekeeping operations (A/63/837). However, as acknowledged by  the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in 2009,  insufficient time had elapsed for these efforts to have yielded a meaningful  assessment of the impact of the restructuring.   23. In retrospect, there are many reasons for the promise of the restructuring not  being fully met, of which three have had lasting repercussions. The first is the fact  that the proposal was not fully approved; the General Assembly deferred  consideration of the proposed transfer of responsibility and resources for field  procurement from the Department of Management to the Department of Field  Support. However, the present report provides a proposal on how to implement an  integrated supply chain within one department while maintaining the necessary  segregation of duties and safeguards. The present report proposes that both logistics  and procurement be located within the new Office of Supply Chain Management,  therefore allowing for much closer coordination between the two functions in the  sourcing process and eliminating the bureaucratic delays currently experienced when  processes cross departmental lines, all while maintaining the requisite segregation of  duties. Further safeguards are also available through technical role mapping in  Umoja, functionality that was not available when the Department of Field Support  was established. This allows for a much more responsive approach to the delivery of  goods and services while still protecting against waste, fraud and abuse.   24. Second, while many weaknesses were identified in the system of delegation of  authority, most of the steps taken did not address the fragmentation or inconsistencies  in how authority was delegated to different parts of the system. Instead, efforts taken  by the Secretariat were focused on formalizing the existing process of delegation of  authority, including through the promulgation of administrative issuances on the    A/72/492/Add.2    207/246  18-04386    delegation of authority under the Financial Regulations and Rules and Staff  Regulations and Rules. These measures alone have not been sufficient to address  certain weaknesses in the delegations, as evidenced through observations of the Board  of Auditors related to delegation of procurement authority in its report for the year  ended 31 December 2016 (A/72/5 (Vol. I) and A/72/5 (Vol. I)/Corr.1) and delegation  of authority for peacekeeping operations in its report on United Nations peacekeeping  operations for the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017 (A/72/5 (Vol. II)).  25. Third, restructuring and delegation of authority are themselves necessary but  not sufficient to improve the effective and accountable delivery of mandates. These  processes must be accompanied by the associated overhaul of administrative policies  and procedures. During an audit by the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the  management structures of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations prior to the  restructuring in 2007, the Department and many missions indicated that certain rules  and procedures ""were outdated, were too rigid and did not correspond to the current  field realities in peacekeeping missions"" (A/61/743, para. 30). However, no  meaningful review of rules and procedures was conducted following the adoption of  resolution 61/279, and the same concerns regarding the existing policy framework  have been regularly raised, including in the audit by the Office of Internal Oversight  Services following the restructuring (see A/63/837), by the High-level Independent  Panel on Peace Operations (see A/70/95-S/2015/446) and by Member States and staff  of all levels during the consultations convened in early 2017 by the internal review  team on management reform.   26. The current reform initiative builds on the lessons learned from both the  restructuring exercise itself and the past decade's worth of experience with delivery  of services to peace operations by a dedicated support entity, the Department of Field  Support. While one of the three challenges listed above is not within the ability of the  Secretariat to address, the other two, namely the challenges of delegation and the  overhaul of policies, are explicitly being addressed as part of the reforms. The  paradigm shift towards a decentralized Secretariat, where responsibility is aligned  with authority and management of resources, requires a restructuring of the  Secretariat to ensure that the management architecture has dedicated capacities  focusing on the objectives of improved effectiveness and enhanced accountability,  which are prerequisites for direct delegation. It also requires a parallel effort to ensure  that the overall policy framework is rebuilt from the ground up to facilitate the new  paradigm. As indicated in the first report of the Secretary-General on management  reform, a review and simplification of human resources policies and procedures will  be completed in 2018, and progress will be reported to the General Assembly during  the main part of its seventy-third session. Finally, strong leadership is also required  to help to implement a culture shift in the Organization. The management reform can  realize its full potential only if all elements are in place.   27. The proposed structure of the new management architecture also builds on best  practices identified as part of the 2007 restructuring. One of the fundamental reasons  for the proposal to move the Office of Mission Support out of the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations and to upgrade it to a department was a concern over the  problem of managerial overstretching and a recognition of the need for greater clarity  of departmental roles and responsibilities. Subsequent reviews concluded that the  establishment of the Department of Field Support both recognized the criticality of  support issues in the success of missions and allowed the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations to focus on substantive peacekeeping issues. Consequently, the proposed  restructuring of the management architecture also takes into consideration concerns  regarding entrusting any single department with too broad and unmanageable a span  of control. It also benefits from specialization and a clear division of roles and  responsibilities to prepare the Organization to meet future challenges.

"accountability","  United Nations    A/73/688      General Assembly    Distr.: General  28 December 2018  Original: English    18-22826 (E)    180119  *1822826*      Seventy-third session  Agenda item 135  Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial  functioning of the United Nations           Eighth progress report on the accountability system in the  United Nations Secretariat: strengthening accountability  under the new management paradigm         Report of the Secretary-General*         Summary    The Secretary-General has the honour to submit to the General Assembly the  eighth progress report on the accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat,  as requested by the Assembly in its resolution 72/303.    Section II of the report provides an update on three priority achievements that  are integral to enabling faster, more sustainable progress in strengthening the  accountability system under the new management paradigm: (a) improving the system  of delegation of authority; (b) strengthening the implementation of results-based  management; and (c) establishing the Business Transformation and Accountability  Division.    Section III gives an overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat  against the six components of the accountability system. The progress made in the  current reporting period and key deliverables going forward are outlined.    Although progress has been made, more remains to be done in 2019 to further  strengthen the accountability system in support of the Secretary-General's new  management paradigm. This is to be the primary focus of the new Business  Transformation and Accountability System Division, which will support managers and  staff in improving their understanding of what is expected of them with respect to  governance, policy, risks and internal controls in accordance with the Charter of the  United Nations, the resolutions and decisions of the principal organs of the United  Nations and the regulations and rules. The Division will also help entities to embed  the ""three lines of defence"" model in enterprise risk management processes at all levels  of the Secretariat.      * The present report was submitted late in order to reflect the most recent information.  A/73/688      18-22826  2/30      The new management paradigm is dependent on the Secretariat's ability to  undertake a more structured and rigorous implementation of the accountability system  than previously achieved. A culture shift of such significance can happen only over  time. When all the measures proposed in the present report are implemented, they will  support tangible progress going forward.            A/73/688    3/30  18-22826      I. Introduction      1.  The Secretary-General has made greater accountability of staff and managers  for the effective use of resources and improved delivery of mandates a cornerstone of  his management reform process. Increased accountability is a critical element for  achieving organizational results. The General Assembly, in its resolution 72/266 B,  stressed that accountability is a central principle of management reform.   2.  In 2010, the Secretary-General proposed to the General Assembly a framework  for the accountability system of the Secretariat, consisting of six main interrelated  components that are embedded in the definition of accountability approved by the  General Assembly in its resolution 64/259. The Secretary-General has since submitted  annual reports to the General Assembly on efforts to strengthen the accountability  system and the internal control framework of the Organization.   3.  The present progress report provides an update on accountability measures.  Following the introduction in section I, section II provides an update on three key  achievements that are integral to enabling faster progress in strengthening the  accountability system under the new management paradigm. Section III gives an  overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat against the six components  of the accountability system. Sections IV and V contain conclusions and  recommendations.   4.  In addition, the status of implementation of the recommendations of oversight  bodies during the period from 2008 to 2017 is outlined in annex I; progress in the  implementation of results-based management is described in annex II; and annex III  contains a summary of progress in the implementation of General Assembly  resolution 72/303.        II. Progress in enhancing accountability under the new  management paradigm       5.  Strengthening the accountability system and the internal control framework of  the Secretariat has been a continuous process. In recent years, for example, the  Secretariat has established an Ethics Office, instituted a financial disclosure  programme, developed senior managers' compacts and begun to embed enterprise risk  management and results-based management in its functioning. Those efforts have  been reflected in the annual progress reports presented to the General Assembly since  2010.  6.  In his report entitled ""Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations:  ensuring a better future for all"" (A/72/492), the Secretary-General highlighted the  following six key challenges that need to be addressed if the Organization is to be  more effective and responsive to those it serves:     (a)  Slow and unresponsive service delivery;     (b)  Fragmentation in management structures;     (c)  A weak performance management culture;     (d)  Gaps in resourcing of mandates and ineffective management of resources  for the implementation of mandates;     (e)  Gaps in transparency and accountability;    (f)  A trust deficit between Member States and the Secretariat.  A/73/688      18-22826  4/30    7.  In addition, in the 2017 staff engagement survey, it was found that 30 per cent  of staff members had concerns about ethical conduct and the culture of accountability  in the Organization.  8.  The six challenges noted by the Secretary-General, the perceptions of staff, the  views of the oversight bodies and resolutions of the General Assembly indicate that  there are deficiencies in the implementation of the accountability system and its  practical operation.   9.  Accordingly, the Secretary-General's new management paradigm places  improving accountability at the centre of two commitments. The first is to give senior  managers the full authority to deliver on their mandates, as long as they do so  transparently, responsibly and accountably. The second is a pledge to Member States  that the Secretariat will be transparent, responsible and accountable in its stewardship  of the resources of the Organization and in delivering on agreed mandates.  10. The General Assembly, in its resolution 72/266 B, welcomed the commitment  of the Secretary-General to improving the ability of the United Nations to deliver on  its mandates through management reform, and stressed that accountability is a central  principle of management reform. In its resolution 72/303, the Assembly welcomed  the efforts of the Secretary-General towards a strong culture of accountability  throughout the Secretariat, and stressed that an effective accountability system is  central to successful management of the Organization.  11. In his seventh progress report on accountability (A/72/773, para. 41), the  Secretary-General stressed the importance of the implementation of the following  actions for increased accountability in the context of the new management paradigm:    (a)  Updating the Secretariat's accountability system and preparing  management accountability guidance;     (b)  Strengthening the implementation of results-based management;     (c)  Placing a stronger emphasis on the ""three lines of defence"" model to  improve the risk management systems;     (d)  Strengthening the senior managers' compact system;     (e)  Adopting a statement of internal control;     (f)  Creating an improved system of delegation of authority;     (g)  Developing a new set of monitoring and compliance functions.  12. This section provides an update on three key achievements that are integral to  enabling faster, more sustainable progress in strengthening the accountability system  under the new management paradigm: (a) improving the system of delegation of  authority; (b) strengthening the implementation of results-based management; and  (c) establishing the Business Transformation and Accountability Division.   13. Progress in implementing the other new functions and processes of the  Secretariat's accountability system is described in section III.         A. Improving the system of delegation of authority      14. In paragraph 17 of its resolution 72/303, the General Assembly stressed the need  for the Secretary-General to address the deficiencies in the current system of  delegation of authority through the promulgation of well-defined roles and  responsibilities of individuals at all levels to whom authority is delegated, systemic  reporting mechanisms on monitoring and exercise of delegated authority, risk    A/73/688    5/30  18-22826    mitigation and safeguard measures, and actions to be taken in cases of  mismanagement or abuse of authority.        Progress to date     15. As the chief administrative officer, the Secretary-General holds the primary  authority and accountability for the administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules  and the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. In December 2018,  the Secretary-General issued a bulletin (ST/SGB/2019/2) for the purposes of aligning  authorities with responsibilities, decentralizing decision-making and strengthening  accountability. From 1 January 2019, to bring decision-making closer to the point of  delivery, heads of entities will exercise delegated managerial authority over human,  financial and physical resources under the Staff Regulations and Rules and the  Financial Regulations and Rules. The annexes to the bulletin set out the standard  authorities that a head of entity may receive, depending on the capacity of the entity  to receive and exercise the delegations in a responsible and effective manner. All  delegations of authority are issued and recorded through a dedicated online portal.   16. Heads of entities also received a formal document that stated that any delegation  is granted in relation to their current role and function and that set out their personal  responsibility for duly discharging the authority and accountability for incorrectly  applying or failing to correctly discharge the authority. Authority delegated to a head  of entity may be further delegated, but the head of entity remains accountable and  responsible. Subdelegations should be along reporting lines and on a functional and  not a personal basis and be consistent with responsibilities.  17. Figure I illustrates the delegation of authority, including roles and  responsibilities, based on a standard four-stage cycle for continuous improvement of  plan, do, check and act. Should circumstances arise that justify a curtailment of  delegated authority, delegations may be suspended, amended or revoked by the  Secretary-General on the advice of the Under-Secretary-General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance in consultation with the Under-Secretary-General  for Operational Support. This could result in administrative or disciplinary measures,  as appropriate, in accordance with the Staff Regulations and Rules.      A/73/688      18-22826  6/30    Figure I   Cycle of delegation of decision-making authority            Monitoring delegations of authority    18. The Monitoring and Evaluation Service of the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division will monitor key performance indicators across human  resources, finance, procurement, travel and property management by using  information from Umoja, Inspira and Unite Apps and/or requesting information from  managers and by conducting management reviews. Although it was established only  recently, the framework was designed to help heads of entities to demonstrate that  they are exercising the authorities delegated to them to ""the highest standards of  efficiency, competence and integrity"" (Charter of the United Nations, Article 101.3).  If applied effectively, the framework will:     (a)  Enable heads of entities to demonstrate that they are exercising their  delegated authority in a transparent, responsible and accountable manner by:    (i)  Complying with regulations and rules, the policy framework and internal  controls;    (ii) Effectively managing the delegation cycle;    (iii) Monitoring performance trends over time, sharing lessons on why  performance is improving or triggering an intervention when performance is  deteriorating;    (b)  Enable the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance  to monitor how heads of entities are exercising their delegated authorities and to  provide assurance to the Secretary-General by:   * * Purpose: Heads of entities and the  the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance monitor  the exercise of delegated authority,  reporting variations in performance and  non-compliance * Purpose:                                                       To resolve problems in the exercise of  delegated authority in the most effective  way to improve performance and  prevent future non-compliance and to  ensure that lessons learned are fed back  into step A, ""Plan"" * Purpose:                                                    Heads of entities exercise their  delegations of authority effectively and in  compliance with the regulatory     framework * Purpose:                                                                To ensure that the accountability of heads  of entities is clear, that delegations are  formally accepted by heads of entities and  that heads of entities are well equipped  and informed to use their delegations A. PLAN Establish delegation of  authority  (Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and  Compliance/Department of  Operational Support/head of  entity) B. DO Exercise delegation of  authority (Head of entity/Department of  Operational Support) C. CHECK Monitor delegation of  authority (Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and  Compliance/head of entity) D. ACT Correct the exercise of or  suspend/amend/withdraw  delegation of authority  (Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and  Compliance/Department of  Operational Support/head of  entity)   A/73/688    7/30  18-22826      (i)  Ensuring consistent measurement across the Secretariat to enable the  identification of systemic problems and opportunities to improve current  policies, processes and procedures;     (ii) Triggering a response to problems in how entities exercise their  delegations, for example, providing training or policy guidance or even  suspending, amending or revoking the delegated authority;    (iii) Generating lessons and good practices for continuous learning.        Going forward    19. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division will manage and  oversee the quality of the monitoring framework, ensuring that the framework is  applied consistently across the Secretariat. The Division will also ensure that the  monitoring framework continuously improves and adapts to the needs of its users  through the addition of new key performance indicators or the discontinuation of  existing ones. The framework will need to evolve as the Secretariat's organizational  performance measurement capability matures through the full implementation and  stabilization of results-based management, enterprise risk management, Umoja  Extension 2 and innovations in the Division's data analytics capability.        B. Strengthening the implementation of results-based management       20. The Secretariat is making progress in implementing the detailed action plan for  the implementation of results-based management in the United Nations Secretariat,  2018-2021, in compliance with General Assembly resolution 72/303 (see annex II).        Progress to date     21.  In response to General Assembly resolution 72/266 A, in which the Assembly  approved changes to the budget procedures and format, a change management process  was implemented to support departments and special political missions in the  preparation of part II of the 2020 programme budget documents, which will contain the  programme plan for programmes and subprogrammes and programme performance  information. A total of 28 workshops were conducted, involving 1,500 staff. During the  sessions, programme managers received assistance in drafting the programme plan and  performance information to demonstrate how the Organization's work contributes  tangibly to planned results and how programme plans build on programme performance  and lessons learned, including from evaluations. Programme performance will be  assessed using both quantitative performance measures and qualitative information.   22. In 2018, the Secretary-General issued a communication to all senior managers  on the need to shift to a culture of results and included in the senior managers'  compacts for 2019 an indicator that will assess the contributions of senior managers  to the implementation of results-based management in their entities and to ensuring  the engagement of all staff in the implementation of the results-based management  action plan. In addition, the senior managers' compacts include an indicator that  requests senior managers to use the result frameworks included in their planning  documents as the starting point for the preparation of the annual workplans of staff.   23. As the oversight bodies have repeatedly emphasized, results-based management  also requires a strong link between programme performance and financial  performance. The new Umoja Extension 2 strategic planning, budgeting and  performance management solution is scheduled to go live in January 2019. At this  stage, the solution is to be used for the peacekeeping budgets for 2019/20, for  planning for activities funded by voluntary contributions for 2019 and for the  proposed programme budget for 2020.     A/73/688      18-22826  8/30        Going forward    24. The dedicated results-based management team of the Business Transformation  and Accountability Division will continue to support the Secretariat's efforts to  embed the concept of results-based management in the daily work of staff.   25. Umoja Extension 2 will enable a better assessment of whether the Organization  is using its resources efficiently and effectively. The strategic planning, budgeting  and performance management solution will support results-based management by  enabling better planning, execution and monitoring of, and reporting on, programme  delivery and will also link different elements of the programme plans to resources.  The performance dashboards developed for that purpose will be deployed  incrementally for administrative data and subsequently for performance data.         C. Establishing the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division       26. The new management paradigm is dependent on the Secretariat's ability to  ensure a more structured and rigorous implementation of the accountability system  than previously achieved. Before the establishment of the Business Transformation  and Accountability Division, there was limited dedicated capacity and capability to  implement elements of the accountability system.         Progress to date    27. The final structure of the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance has been designed. From 1 January 2019, the Department will work to  ensure that all key policies, processes and procedures are in place and operating  effectively. The new Business Transformation and Accountability Division will  provide dedicated support to managers and staff to help them to understand what is  expected with respect to governance, policy, risks and internal controls. Only then  can staff be held fully accountable. As a new entity, the Division will take time to  achieve full operational effectiveness.         Going forward     28. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division will support the  Secretariat in the following ways:     (a)  Finalizing comprehensive guidance on the Secretariat's accountability  structures and operations;    (b)  Providing guidance and support for the delegation of authority and  systematic and frequent monitoring of the use of delegations and segregation of  duties;     (c)  Embedding the ""three lines of defence"" model in enterprise risk  management processes at all levels of the Secretariat;     (d)  Monitoring performance and compliance through data analytics and  introducing programme performance dashboards;     (e)  Strengthening self-evaluation activities, including through issuing policy  and guidelines;     (f)  Systematically conducting management reviews and quality assurance  exercises.         A/73/688    9/30  18-22826      III. Overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat      29. Pursuant to paragraph 19 of General Assembly resolution 72/303, this section  provides an overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat. The progress  made in strengthening the different elements that comprise the six components of the  accountability system is described, and key deliverables going forward are outlined.        Accountability system     30. Figure II illustrates the six components that comprise the core of the  Secretariat's accountability system, as embedded in the definition of accountability  provided in paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 64/259: (a) the Charter of  the United Nations; (b) the programme planning and budgetary documents of the  Organization; (c) results and performance; (d) internal control systems; (e) ethical  standards and integrity; and (f) oversight functions. A more detailed introduction to  the accountability system of the Secretariat, its components and interactions can be  found in the seventh progress report (see A/72/773, annex I).      A/73/688      18-22826  10/30    Figure II   Accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat       * External oversight bodies that provide independent assurance to the General Assembly.          Developing the overview of the status of accountability     31. In its related report on the accountability system (A/72/885), the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions concluded that the annual  progress reports on accountability should be enhanced to provide, in addition to  details and proposals on specific accountability policies, systems and mechanisms, an  overview of the status of accountability in the Secretariat. This could include a set of  indicators to monitor overall trends and progress resulting from the implementation    A/73/688    11/30  18-22826    of the system of accountability (ibid., para. 53). The request for such an overview was  endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 72/303.  32. In response, the Secretariat has conducted a self-assessment using the following  two alternative methodologies:    (a)  The internal audit guide on assessing the effectiveness of an organization's  accountability framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors;1     (b)  The Joint Inspection Unit benchmarks contained in its report on  accountability frameworks in the United Nations system (A/66/710/Add.1).   33. The results and methodology used in the self-assessment will be provided to  Member States as supplementary information. In addition, the Secretariat intends to  undertake a self-evaluation to assess how the existing components are functioning to  inform the overview section in future accountability reports and to aid in the  development of key progress indicators that might result from the evaluation.         A. Component I: Charter of the United Nations       34. The Charter enshrines the basic principles of the Organization and identifies its  principal organs and their roles and responsibilities as well as those of the Secretary- General. The Charter, among other things, establishes that the Secretary-General is  the chief administrative officer of the United Nations (Article 97) and entrusts him  with implementing the mandates promulgated by the principal organs of the United  Nations (Article 98). The General Assembly, in paragraph 6 of its resolution 72/303,  noted the importance of compliance with the Charter, its resolutions and the  regulations and rules as one of the essential components of accountability.  Strengthening the performance of the other five components will support this  objective.        B. Component II: programme planning and budget documents           Progress to date    35. In its resolution 72/266 A, the General Assembly decided that the proposed  programme budget document shall consist of the following three parts: (a) part I: the  plan outline, which endorses the long-term priorities and the objectives of the  Organization; (b) part II: the programme plan for programmes and subprogrammes  and programme performance information; and (c) part III: the post and non-post  resource requirements for the programmes and subprogrammes. The programme  budget for 2020 was prepared in accordance with this decision.         Going forward    36. Managers and staff members across the Secretariat will use the results-based  frameworks included in part II of the programme budget documents and other  planning and budgeting documents of the Organization (e.g., peacekeeping budgets)  as the starting point for preparing their annual workplans. Led by the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, this action will be implemented by  March 2019.    __________________    1  Marianne Avarello and Brian Bost, ""Internal audit guide on assessing the effectiveness of an  organization's accountability framework"", report to the Institute of Internal Auditors (Ottawa  Chapter), November 2003.  A/73/688      18-22826  12/30      C. Component III: results and performance         1.  Organizational performance    37. Taking into consideration the decisions of Member States and the findings and  recommendations of the oversight bodies related to results-based management,2 the  Secretary-General has identified strengthening the implementation of results-based  management in the Secretariat and holding managers and staff accountable for the  delivery of results as critical aspects for shifting the management paradigm.  38. In March 2018, the Secretary-General stated that, in order to enhance  transparency, and in line with the new competencies, leaders will be expected to use  data when establishing measurable key performance indicators. Senior leader  compacts will be linked to departmental, divisional, sectional, team-based and  individual workplans. Performance data will inform continuous performance dialogue  within departments, sections and teams and will be used to assess impact, readjust  approaches, develop staff and learn from mistakes to achieve better results  (A/72/492/Add.2, para. 15).        Progress to date    39. A new Analytics and Project Management Service of the Business  Transformation and Accountability Division has been designed to work with entities  to leverage the global management reporting capabilities of Umoja and other  enterprise solutions. The Division is to develop business analytics and visualization  tools to provide real-time support on performance to senior managers and other  stakeholders. Programme-specific performance management dashboards are under  construction to provide real-time information on resource utilization and programme  implementation that will: (a) ensure greater transparency; (b) increase awareness of  the extent to which programmes are achieving expected results; and (c) demonstrate  whether entities are using their resources effectively.        Going forward    40. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will provide  managers with timely and complete information to enable faster decision-making and  better service delivery to clients. This will be accompanied by training for staff to  improve their ability to use programme and financial information generated by  enterprise applications. The presentation of the results of the Organization's work is  being improved by including information on both planned and actual results to which  the respective subprogrammes contribute, allowing the link between results and  resources to be seen. This will be completed by 30 April 2019.  41. The data analytics team of the Business Transformation and Accountability  Division will design, develop and deploy specialized solutions to meet specific  requirements from managers and other stakeholders. The team will take advantage of  innovations in data analytics by applying statistical and algorithmic methods as well  as different approaches in data mining.       2.  Senior managers' compacts    42. The compacts between the Secretary-General and his senior managers are a key  element of the accountability system, becoming perhaps even more so following the  enhanced delegations of authority on 1 January 2019.   __________________    2  See, for example, A/69/5 (Vol. I), chap. II, A/71/5 (Vol. I) chap. II, and A/72/809.    A/73/688    13/30  18-22826    43. The compacts have been continuously improved since their introduction. For  example, in 2018, senior managers' compacts were strengthened to include: the  profile of leadership based on the United Nations system leadership framework  endorsed by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination  (CEB); a request to identify the top three risks of a department or mission and plans  for their mitigation; protections for whistle-blowers; the prevention of and response  to allegations of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment; and diversity targets.         Progress to date    44. The compacts continue to be strengthened. The 2019 compacts include the  following:    (a)  An indicator of the implementation by senior managers of results-based  management and a requirement to report on expected results, progress updates and  course corrections, if necessary;     (b)  A requirement for senior managers to exercise the authority delegated to  them in compliance with regulations and rules and all relevant policies and guidelines.  45. A 360-degree evaluation mechanism focused on the nine leadership  characteristics that are essential to fulfilling the Organization's core mandates  (A/72/492, para. 17) was developed. Pilots were launched in December 2018, and the  360-degree evaluation for senior managers will be rolled out in 2019.   46. Management arrangements have also been enhanced. The compacts are  administered through an electronic system. From 1 January 2019, a dedicated team  under the Business Transformation and Accountability Division will be tasked with  the following:    (a)  Assessing performance against 2018 compact indicators;    (b)  Reviewing draft compacts for 2019 for compliance with guidance;     (c)  Supporting senior managers when requested;    (d)  Submitting the final compacts to the Secretary-General for approval.        Going forward     47. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division will use data  analytics to improve the management of the Organization. It will monitor and assess  performance against the 2019 compact indicators, drawing on business insight from  performance dashboards and the monitoring of delegations of authority. The Division  will also work with senior managers to improve the new management arrangements,  the electronic system and the compacts themselves and make any necessary  adjustments in the 2020 cycle.       3.  Performance appraisal systems     48. The Secretary-General is committed to implementing an effective system of  incentives for strong performance, remedial action for underperformance and  sanctions for unsatisfactory behaviour and misconduct. The General Assembly, in its  resolution 70/244, requested the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) to  conduct a study on the performance management schemes in common system  organizations and to formulate recommendations on performance incentives. In  January 2018, the Assembly approved the Commission's recommendations in its  resolution 72/255.    A/73/688      18-22826  14/30        Progress to date    49. In April 2018, in response to the recommendations of ICSC, the Secretariat  consulted staff representatives and re-established the Staff-Management Committee  working group on performance management.  50. In September 2018, the Secretariat launched an online performance  management learning programme. The goal is to support managers in making  decisions when assessing performance and thus improve the current distribution of  ratings of performance.   51. The Office of Human Resources Management has conducted a gap analysis to  inform the next phases of improvement. The analysis identified major opportunities,  including the need:    (a)  To ensure staff goals align with the Organization's goals;    (b)  To strengthen the link among mobility, career development and  performance management, which will be further addressed in the mobility framework  to be presented during the seventy-fourth session of the General Assembly;     (c)  To address the perceived subjectivity of evaluations provided by managers  during the appraisal process.         Going forward     52. The Office of Human Resources Management will develop options to respond  to the gap analysis. Effective systems of incentives for good performance and for the  application of remedial action and sanctions for underperformance will be  implemented by March 2020. Options include the following:    (a)  Integrating performance management into the organizational leadership  and management model to clarify what the Organization expects of managers;    (b)  Expanding training for managers and staff to include skills development  beyond process and policy;     (c)  Expanding efforts to build the capability of human resources practitioners  across the Secretariat in complex case management, the management of  underperformance and the provision of guidance on evaluations for managers and  staff members at their locations;    (d)  Enhancing the current e-performance system to strengthen managerial  accountability for performance;     (e)  Publishing data and trends on compliance with the requirements of  performance management and on the distribution of ratings of performance across the  Secretariat.        D. Component IV: internal control systems       53. The Secretariat is making progress in strengthening its internal control systems,  while also simplifying and streamlining them as described below.       1.  Regulations, rules, manuals, administrative issuances and standard  operating procedures         Progress to date     54. The Secretariat has made progress in simplifying and streamlining its human  resources, finance and programme support policy frameworks. Policies and processes    A/73/688    15/30  18-22826    have been redrafted to reflect the Umoja integration process and to clarify their  interpretation, on the basis of input provided by Secretariat staff across all duty  stations and field missions.  55. For example, the Staff Regulations and Rules have been reorganized, simplified  and made more user-friendly by removing duplications and placing operational details  in the administrative issuances. Progress has also been made in the revision of the  Staff Regulations and Rules to achieve gender parity, as proposed by the Secretary- General.   56. The first phase of amendments to the Staff Regulations and Rules (A/73/378)  was submitted to the General Assembly for its consideration at the main part of the  seventy-third session. These efforts will be further expanded, with additional  amendments to the Staff Regulations and Rules to be proposed to the Assembly in  2019 in respect of contractual arrangements and in 2020 in respect of conditions of  service.  57. Interim amendments to the Financial Rules have been issued to facilitate the  implementation of the new delegation of authority framework, and revisions to the  Financial Regulations to improve their alignment with the new management paradigm  have been submitted to the General Assembly for consideration. The amendments to  the Financial Regulations and Rules will be accompanied by changes to related  policies in the areas of budget and finance, procurement and property management.  58. The promulgation of new administrative instructions governing procurement  and the revision of the United Nations Procurement Manual to provide clear and  detailed guidance to all staff on the subject will be completed by 31 March 2019.       2.  Updating of legal instruments for engaging third parties     59. The Umoja grant management module was deployed at the end of 2018 and  includes the functionality to create standard template agreements with implementing  partners and end beneficiaries that will include anti-corruption and anti-fraud clauses.  In addition, the revised Financial Regulations and Rules that will be submitted to the  General Assembly in the first part of its resumed seventy-third session include the  proposal of new regulations and rules on implementing partners and end beneficiaries.  These revised regulations and rules will serve as the basis for formulating a  Secretariat-wide policy on the management of implementing partners and end  beneficiaries, including transparent application and selection processes, due  diligence, capacity assessment, project execution by partners and reporting.        Going forward    60. As indicated by the Secretary-General in his reports on shifting the management  paradigm, this effort to simplify regulations, rules, policies and procedures will be  accompanied by the establishment of an online compendium covering all areas of  administrative policy and the development of detailed user-friendly and readily  available case studies and decision trees to guide and support managers in this  process. The compendium will also allow users to quickly identify the current policy  and available guidance materials for any subject. Together with an online portal for  the management of delegation of authority, the compendium will support entities in  enhancing accountability in their exercise of delegation of authority.      3.  Enterprise risk management    61. In his previous progress report (A/72/773), the Secretary-General committed  himself to implementing in the Secretariat the ""three lines of defence"" model as  adopted by CEB. The model enhances the understanding of risk management and  A/73/688      18-22826  16/30    control of an organization by clarifying roles and duties and by providing guidance  for the implemented structure and the assigned roles and responsibilities of parties to  increase the effective management of risk and control.3         Progress to date     62. A dedicated enterprise risk management team has been designed in the Business  Transformation and Accountability Division to support entities in undertaking risk  assessment exercises to identify, evaluate and manage the specific risks that might  affect the functioning of their operations. The Division, which is to be the owner of  the Secretariat's risk management framework and methodology, will have the  following three main responsibilities:    (a)  Implementing Secretariat-wide risk assessment exercises and managing  the risks at the enterprise level;     (b)  Providing support, advice, training and guidance to operational managers  and staff in the first line of defence;     (c)  Creating and managing the register for all risks that have been identified  by heads of entity, identifying trends and patterns as well as successful risk mitigation  initiatives that have been implemented, and sharing lessons learned with managers in  the first line of defence.   63. A second Secretariat-wide risk assessment is being prepared with the active  participation of all Secretariat entities on the basis of the following past three  corporate risk assessment exercises implemented by the Organization:    (a)  The Secretariat-wide enterprise risk assessment (2014);    (b)  The fraud and corruption risk assessment (2018);    (c)  The risk assessment for the implementation of the management reform  (ongoing).   64. A single draft risk register for the entire Organization was prepared as the  starting point of the second Secretariat-wide risk assessment, conducted to update,  revise and validate the results of the three prior assessments. This will constitute the  comprehensive risk register of the Secretariat.         Going forward     65. Following the enhanced delegation of authority to heads of entities on 1 January  2019, the Business Transformation and Accountability Division will support the  Secretariat in embedding the ""three lines of defence"" model, inter alia, by preparing  a pamphlet underlining the responsibilities of every line of defence, by including a  training module on the subject in the induction training of staff members at all levels  and by including a chapter on the subject in the global accountability guidelines. The  responsibilities can be summarized as follows:     * The first line of defence is management. Heads of entities must identify specific  risk owners from their senior management teams for high priority risks  identified in the specific risk assessment exercises of their respective  departments, offices or missions. Risk owners are responsible for ensuring  controls systems are in place and operating effectively to mitigate risks. They  are also expected to escalate any deficiencies that might call for a review and  __________________    3  Enterprise Risk Management Initiative Faculty and Meredith Freeman, ""COSO's take on the  three lines of defense"", North Carolina State University, 26 June 2018. Available at  https://erm.ncsu.edu/library/article/cosos-take-on-the-three-lines-of-defense.    A/73/688    17/30  18-22826    redesign of the Secretariat's policies or controls and ideas to simplify policies  and processes as applicable, and/or automate them where practical, to heads of  entities, the Department of Operational Support and the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.     * The second line of defence is the Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance, the Office of Legal Affairs, the Ethics Office, the policy and  compliance functions of the Office of Information and Communications  Technology, the Department of Safety and Security and the areas of the  Department of Operational Support that provide operational advisory services  to clients to support the implementation of decisions. This line of defence  monitors and supports the implementation of effective risk management  practices by operational management, assisting risk owners in reporting and  escalating relevant risk-related information. In the Secretariat, this line is also  responsible for issuing policies that govern the Organization.    * The third line of defence is the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).  OIOS assists the Secretary-General in protecting the Organization's assets by  providing assurance that programme activities have led to the programmed  results and have been implemented in compliance with all relevant resolutions,  regulations, rules and policies of the Organization. It also plays a key role in  preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse, malfeasance and mismanagement.  OIOS conducts audits, evaluations, inspections and investigations, and its  reports are submitted directly to the General Assembly.   66. The Secretariat has an additional level of oversight, composed of two external  oversight bodies: the Board of Auditors and the Joint Inspection Unit. In addition, the  Independent Audit Advisory Committee plays a key role.  67. A more detailed description of the ""three lines of defence"" model can be found  in section IV of the seventh progress report. The Business Transformation and  Accountability Division has developed a document outlining how the three lines of  defence work to mitigate risks, which will be provided to Member States as  supplementary information.       4.  Statement of internal control         Progress to date     68. The Office of the Controller and the internal control advisory group on  statements of internal control translated the 17 principles of the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission into the United Nations  environment and the implementation of the internal controls in Umoja. The issuance  of the statement of internal control and the deployment of the process to collect the  self-assessments from heads of entities will reflect the new delegations of authority  and their impact on business processes.         Going forward     69. A statement of internal control will be in place by the first quarter of 2021.  Under the statement, heads of entities will be required to sign a statement at the end  of each calendar year attesting to compliance with the internal control framework  under their areas of responsibility.      5.  Evaluation     70. In its resolution 72/303, the General Assembly emphasized that evaluation and  self-evaluation are essential managerial tools and that senior managers have the  responsibility to use evaluation and self-evaluation findings to improve performance  A/73/688      18-22826  18/30    and learning, and in this regard requested the Secretary-General to continue to take  concrete measures to enhance in-house capacity for self-evaluation, including  self-evaluation support within the Secretariat, taking advantage of the existing  knowledge and expertise of oversight bodies to ensure that all efforts are made to  avoid the duplication and/or overlapping of efforts.        Progress to date     71. In early 2019, the Business Transformation and Accountability Division will  issue guidelines to entities on the conduct of self-evaluations, containing the  following elements:    (a)  A clear explanation of the role of evaluation;    (b)  A clear definition of the institutional framework, roles and responsibilities;    (c)  An explanation of how evaluations are to be prioritized, planned and  budgeted;    (d)  An explanation of how evaluations are to be organized and managed and  how to ensure their quality;    (e)  The mechanisms for management response to and follow-up of  evaluations;    (f)  The dissemination and disclosure procedures for evaluations;    (g)  An explanation of how the guidelines will be operationalized;    (h)  An explanation of how evaluation capacities are to be developed and  maintained.  72. A dedicated evaluation team of the Business Transformation and Accountability  Division has been created. The team has developed a draft evaluation policy for the  Secretariat, which is due to be finalized following consultation. In addition, the  Division is to help entities to develop their evaluation plans for 2019 and 2020.         Going forward     73. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division evaluation team will  have the following responsibilities:    (a)  Owning the Secretariat's evaluation policy and procedures and overseeing  the quality of their implementation across the Secretariat, ensuring that all functioning  evaluation units adopt the new policy;    (b)  Owning the Secretariat's annual evaluation plan, built on the basis of plans  from individual entities;    (c)  Developing and continuously improving the methods and standard tool  box to be used in different types of evaluations;    (d)  Identifying or developing and delivering a suite of training materials and  opportunities and offer a mentoring service;     (e)  Developing and maintaining a roster of external and qualified internal  evaluation experts who would be released by their parent units to undertake short  evaluation and assurance assignments (June 2019);    (f)  Supporting entities in developing high-quality terms of reference and in  ensuring the quality of draft evaluation reports for departments and offices that might  require assistance;     A/73/688    19/30  18-22826      (g)  Developing a virtual ""community of practice"" in which evaluation  specialists or those interested in developing evaluation skills can communicate;    (h)  Performing trend analyses of results and findings across the Secretariat to  improve the delivery of results, extract lessons and feed into the continuum of  improvement.      6.  Oversight coordination         Progress to date     74. A dedicated team has been designed in the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division that will be responsible for providing continuous monitoring  and follow-up services regarding the implementation of oversight recommendations.  The team will inform the Management Committee and the Independent Audit  Advisory Committee of the status of implementation on a quarterly basis.         Going forward     75. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division will conduct reviews  of the reports of oversight bodies every six months to identify trends and systemic  issues that might be affecting the functioning of the Organization, to be used as the  basis for comprehensive solutions to Secretariat-wide problems. The first review will  be prepared by 30 June 2019.      7.  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat     76. In September 2016, the first Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the  United Nations Secretariat (ST/IC/2016/25) was issued. In 2017, the Secretariat  conducted a fraud and corruption risk assessment to identify the most critical areas at  risk of fraud and corruption to inform a comprehensive anti-fraud and anti-corruption  strategy, addressing a long-standing concern of the Board of Auditors that the  Secretariat had not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment regarding fraud (see  A/73/5 (Vol. I), chap. II, sect. H)        Progress to date     77. The Secretariat implemented an enterprise-wide campaign against fraud and  corruption as described in paragraphs 28 and 29 of the sixth progress report  (A/71/729). However, as noted by the Board of Auditors (A/73/5 (Vol. I), chap. II,  para. 294), there is a still a need to reinforce the awareness of staff of the fraud risks  faced by the Organization.   78. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 70/238 A, the High-Level Committee  on Management, on the basis of its consultations with the Representatives of Internal  Audit Services of the United Nations Organizations and the United Nations  Representatives of Investigations Services, adopted common definitions of fraud and  presumptive fraud in March 2017. The agreed common definitions can be employed  by individual organizations, as appropriate, within their respective regulatory  frameworks, legal instruments and policies and in accordance with their specific  requirements.        Going forward     79. Although the update and review of the Secretariat's risk register is proving to  be useful at Headquarters, there is still a need to raise awareness and understanding  of fraud and corruption risks in the field. The Secretariat is using the opportunities  for supporting the offices in the field to increase awareness of that issue. The  completion of risk assessments of most individual entities will enable the  A/73/688      18-22826  20/30    development and implementation of a Secretariat-wide anti-fraud and anti-corruption  strategy, which is at the core of a set of recommendations on the matter issued by the  Board of Auditors (see A/73/5 (Vol. I), chap. II).      8.  Conduct and discipline         Progress to date     80. In compliance with General Assembly resolution 59/287, the Secretariat  published a compendium of disciplinary measures, outlining the practice of the  Secretary-General in disciplinary matters and cases of criminal behaviour from 1 July  2009 to 31 December 2017. 4  The compendium describes long-term trends in  misconduct and/or criminal behaviour and their disciplinary consequences, including  the following:    (a)  The number of staff subject to disciplinary measures increased more than  threefold, from 24 in the 12-month period ended 30 June 2009 to 79 in the 12-month  period ended 30 June 2017;    (b)  The number of staff that have been either separated or dismissed owing to  misconduct also increased more than threefold, from 15 in the 12-month period ended  30 June 2009 to 50 in the 12-month period ended 30 June 2017;    (c)  Of the total of 428 cases of misconduct listed in the report for the period  under consideration, about 50 per cent fell under three categories of misconduct: 94  cases (21 per cent) under fraud, misrepresentation and false certification; 72 cases (17  per cent) under theft and misappropriation; and 55 cases (12 per cent) under assault  (verbal and physical).         Going forward     81. All incidents of misconduct are taken seriously by the Secretariat. The increase  in disciplinary measures and the sanctions of separation or dismissal could be the  result of a control environment that is being strengthened, including an improved  investigations function that provides the basis for the decision to sanction. The  Secretariat will continue to monitor and analyse this information and include its  conclusions in the following accountability report.        E. Component V: ethical standards and integrity       82. The Secretary-General is committed to ensuring an environment in which staff  feel safe to report wrongdoing and to protecting them against retaliation when they  do so. Staff are the first to recognize wrongdoing in the workplace; empowering them  to speak up without fear of reprisal will therefore help to prevent, detect, deter,  respond to and enable reporting on misconduct, fraud and corruption.   83. Progress had been made prior to the reporting period. A significantly  strengthened policy on protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for  cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations (ST/SGB/2017/2) was  promulgated on 20 January 2017, and a revised policy went into effect on  28 November 2017 (ST/SGB/2017/2/Rev.1).       1.  Protection from retaliation     84. The action taken by the Ethics Office towards protection against retaliation in  the period from 1 January to 31 December 2017 is detailed in the relevant report of  __________________    4  With the exception of a period of six months from 1 July 2017 to 31 December 2017.    A/73/688    21/30  18-22826    the Secretary-General (A/73/89, paras. 50-58). During that period, the Ethics Office  received 92 enquiries under the policy on protection against retaliation. Of those, 48  were not claims for protection, but rather requests for advice, while 9 were outside  the Office's jurisdiction. The Office initiated 26 preliminary reviews during the  reporting period. As at 31 December 2017, 22 cases had been completed and 1 claim  had been abandoned. With respect to the 22 completed preliminary reviews, 14 claims  did not present a prima facie case. Most of the cases concerned workplace disputes  between the complainants and their colleagues or supervisors.  85. The 2018 Leadership Dialogue, on the topic ""Speaking up: when does it become  whistle-blowing?"", was launched on 27 August 2018. Further details of the outreach,  training and educational activities undertaken by the Ethics Office during the reporting  period are provided in the report of the Secretary-General (ibid., paras. 59-66).       2.  Preventing sexual exploitation and abuse     86. In his first major report on the topic (A/71/818, A/71/818/Corr.1 and  A/71/818/Add.1), the Secretary-General set out a strategy to prevent and respond to  sexual exploitation and abuse committed by those serving under the United Nations  flag.         Progress to date     87. Progress in implementing the strategy has continued, as described in the report  of the Secretary-General on special measures for protection from sexual exploitation  and abuse (A/72/751 and A/72/751/Corr.1). The key achievements are: (a) the  extension of the mandate of the Special Coordinator on Improving the United Nations  Response to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse until 31 December 2018; and (b) the  appointment of a victims' rights advocate in September 2017 to enhance coordination  and ensure sustained high-level attention to the issue.   88. All United Nations entities with a field presence are required to develop action  plans and risk mitigation strategies against sexual exploitation and abuse and to  submit them annually to the Executive Office of the Secretary-General. Senior  managers must also submit annual certifications to the Secretary-General that all  credible allegations related to United Nations staff and affiliated personnel have been  fully and accurately reported. Certification is required regarding the provision of  training on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse and reporting allegations. A risk  management toolkit was rolled out for use in all field operations in June 2018.  89. The Secretary-General has also strengthened reporting, investigations and  transparency to ensure that there is no impunity for those who engage in those types  of activities. An incident reporting form has been introduced to ensure system-wide  uniformity in the collection of initial information on allegations of sexual exploitation  and abuse. The form is aimed at initiating a formal process within the United Nations  system in response to an allegation or report and determining the appropriate action,  such as an administrative investigation and/or a referral for criminal investigation. To  ensure transparency, the spokesperson of the Secretary General provides quarterly  public updates on allegations received by all entities that are mandated to report to  the General Assembly.5   90. In 2017, the Secretariat developed a new mandatory online training course  entitled ""Prevention of sexual harassment and abuse by United Nations personnel -  working harmoniously"", which is available to all staff members.   __________________    5  Available at www.un.org/preventing-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse/content/quarterly-updates.   A/73/688      18-22826  22/30    91. Since June 2018, a screening tool, Clear Check, has been used across the United  Nations system to prevent personnel connected with substantiated allegations of  sexual exploitation and abuse, or those who leave the United Nations during an  investigation, from being rehired. The same screening platform is being used for  sexual harassment cases. The Secretary-General has also issued the protocol on  allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse involving implementing partners.      3.  Combating sexual harassment     92. Ensuring that staff who have been subjected to or witnessed sexual harassment  feel safe and empowered to speak up is imperative, as is ensuring that appropriate  mechanisms are in place to prevent, investigate and respond to such incidents and  provide protection for victims and witnesses.   93. The Secretary-General has mobilized senior managers to improve guidance,  information and services for staff, with an emphasis on improving support for victims.  Such measures include the 24-hour ""Speak up"" helpline in the Secretariat, an updated  mandatory training programme and an information note on available reporting  mechanisms and services.   94. The Secretariat led a system-wide survey entitled ""Safe space: survey on sexual  harassment in our workplace"" across 31 United Nations and related organizations in  November 2018. The survey, administered in the six official languages, was  completed by 30,493 staff and non-staff. The results are being used to guide evidence- based policymaking.   95. Efforts are also under way to strengthen the investigation and response  capacities of OIOS in areas such as improving the quality of investigation reports and  harmonizing standard operating procedures. In February 2018, OIOS implemented a  streamlined, fast-tracked procedure to process and address all sexual harassment  complaints as category I allegations. A specialized team focusing on investigations of  sexual harassment was created.   96. The CEB task force on addressing sexual harassment promotes the  harmonization of sexual harassment policies and accelerates efforts to increase the  capacity and quality of investigations and victims' protection and support  mechanisms across the United Nations system. The task force works with Member  States to ensure mutual support for initiatives in this area. In the first year since its  inception, the task force has achieved significant progress, including the adoption of  a system-wide model policy on sexual harassment and the launch of a system-wide  sexual harassment screening tool.         F. Component VI: oversight functions       97. The status of implementation of the recommendations of OIOS and the Board  of Auditors is outlined in annex I.      1.  Office of Internal Oversight Services     98. The following three positive trends have been noted in the implementation of  recommendations issued by OIOS during the period from 2008 to 2017:    (a)  Of a total of 12,715 recommendations, 11,637 recommendations (some 91  per cent) have been either implemented or closed by the Secretariat. Only 1,078 (8.5  per cent) of recommendations remain under implementation;     (b)  Of a total of 2,586 critical recommendations, 2,559 recommendations (99  per cent) have been implemented or closed by the Secretariat;    A/73/688    23/30  18-22826      (c)  The number of critical recommendations issued by OIOS decreased during  the period.       2.  Board of Auditors     99. In respect of recommendations issued by the Board of Auditors in volumes I and  II of the financial reports and audited financial statements of the United Nations, the  following positive trends have been noted for the period from 2008 to 2017:     (a)  Of a total of 798 recommendations, 667 recommendations (82 per cent)  have been either implemented by the Secretariat or overtaken by events;    (b)  Only 131 (16 per cent) of recommendations remain under implementation.       3.  Joint Inspection Unit     100. In respect of recommendations issued by the Joint Inspection Unit, the following  trend can be reported for the period from 2008 to 2018: 6  the rate of accepted  recommendations by the Secretariat was 61 per cent, while the rate of implementation  of accepted recommendations was 83 per cent.7   101. Those rates may not reflect the real status of implementation of  recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit to the Secretariat, however, as some  recommendations, although addressed to the General Assembly and to the Secretary- General as Chair of CEB, are counted as recommendations to the Secretariat.         IV. Conclusion       102. The new management paradigm depends on the Secretariat's ability to  undertake a more structured and rigorous implementation of the accountability system  than previously achieved. Achieving a culture shift of such significance will not  happen overnight, and although progress has been made, more remains to be done in  2019 to further strengthen the system. The Secretariat looks forward to receiving  guidance from Member States to continue with this important initiative.         V. Recommendation to the General Assembly       103. The General Assembly is requested to take note of the progress made and  the plans to further strengthen the Secretariat's accountability system, as  described in the present report.        __________________    6  As at Wednesday, 14 November 2018.    7  The Joint Inspection Unit database does not allow users to extract the number of  recommendations, only the percentage.

"accountability","  United Nations    A/75/804      General Assembly    Distr.: General  8 March 2021    Original: English    21-03167 (E)    100321  *2103167*      Seventy-fifth session      Agenda item 139      Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial  functioning of the United Nations                 Tenth progress report on accountability: strengthening  accountability in the United Nations Secretariat         Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and  Budgetary Questions        I. Introduction      1.  The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has  considered the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Tenth progress report on  accountability: strengthening accountability in the United Nations Secretariat""  (A/75/686), submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 74/271. During its  consideration of the report, the Committee met online with representatives of the  Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification, concluding  with written responses received on 25 February 2021.  2.  Since its sixtieth session, held in 2005, the General Assembly has addressed the  importance of accountability and of ensuring greater accountability in the Secretariat,  including in its resolutions 60/260, 63/276 and 64/259. During the sixty-sixth session  of the Assembly, held in 2012, the Secretary-General submitted his first annual report  on progress towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat for  the consideration of Member States. To date, the Secretary-General has submitted  10 such progress reports (A/75/686, A/74/658, A/73/688 and A/73/688/Corr.1,  A/72/773, A/71/729, A/70/668, A/69/676, A/68/697, A/67/714 and A/66/692). In his  tenth progress report, the Secretary-General describes the overall framework of the  accountability system of the United Nations Secretariat and presents information on  various ongoing or planned reviews, pilots, initiatives and technical enhancements of  Umoja and other systems, as well as a description of already available qualitative and  quantitative data depositories and related statistical information. In section II below,  the Advisory Committee addresses selected matters in this regard.  3.  The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in paragraph 8 of  its resolution 64/259, decided that the definition of accountability, which remains in  effect, would be as follows:  A/75/804      21-03167  2/8    Accountability is the obligation of the Secretariat and its staff members to be  answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and to be  responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or exception.  Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a timely  and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all mandates  to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental bodies and  other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all resolutions,  regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective, accurate and timely  reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship of funds and  resources; all aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of  rewards and sanctions; and with due recognition to the important role of the  oversight bodies and in full compliance with accepted recommendations.  4.  Since the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, the Advisory Committee  has continued to provide extensive observations and recommendations in its reports  on the accountability system, as well as in a wide range of reports with an  accountability dimension.1 The Advisory Committee considers that the concept of  an accountability system should represent a critical pillar of the Organization  with a central role in all reform efforts, as well as in all organizational,  administrative and operational changes, and should be anchored by the  aforementioned definition of accountability, which has remained in place since  the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.  5.  The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General has endeavoured to  develop a strong culture of accountability that would be sustainable and holistic  throughout the United Nations Secretariat. The Advisory Committee recommends  that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to focus future  progress reports on the practical aspects of institutional and personal  accountability. In the progress reports, the Secretary-General should therefore  elaborate on the operationalization and reporting of the specific outcomes and  results of the processes and measures that are meant to promote accountability,  including statistical information, and the assessment of their impact. This should  include clearly transparent sets of parameters, including an actionable system of  measures,2 in accordance with the established definition of accountability,  relevant staff regulations and rules, and applicable policies and instructions, as  well as with the guidance provided by intergovernmental bodies, internal and  external oversight bodies, and the Charter of the United Nations.3 Furthermore,  __________________    1 These include the Advisory Committee's previous reports on accountability(A/74/741, A/73/800,  A/72/885, A/71/820, A/70/770, A/69/802, A/68/783, A/67/776, A/66/738; and A/64/683 and  A/64/683/Corr.1, A/63/457 and A/60/418) and its other related reports, including those on:  management reform (A/75/538, A/74/7/Add.32, A/74/7/Add.7, A/73/411, A/72/7/Add.49 and  A/72/7/Add.24); activities of the Ethics Office (A/74/539); special measures for protection from  sexual exploitation and sexual abuse (A/74/788, A/73/828, A/72/824 and A/71/643); the global  field support strategy (A/69/874);  the global service delivery model (A/73/791, A/72/7/Add.50,  A/71/666 and A/70/436); human resources management (A/75/765, A/73/497, A/73/183,  A/71/557, A/70/718, A/69/572 and A/68/523); disciplinary matters (A/75/776 and A/74/558);  amendments to staff regulations and rules (A/74/732 and A/73/622); financial reports and audited  financial statements and reports of the Board of Auditors (A/75/539, A/74/528 and  A/74/528/Corr.1, A/73/430, A/72/537, A/71/669, A/70/380, A/69/386 and A/68/381); the  enterprise resource planning project (Umoja) (A/75/7/Add.14, A/74/7/Add.17, A/72/7/Add.31,  A/71/628, A/70/7/Add.19, A/69/418, A/68/7/Add.7 and A/67/565); and procurement activities  (A/73/790, A/71/823, A/69/809,  A/67/801 and A/64/501).    2 As indicated in paragraph 3 of the present report, the definition of accountability includes all  aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of rewards and sanctions.     3 The conduct of staff of the Secretariat is guided by chapter XV of the Charter of the United  Nations.    A/75/804    3/8  21-03167    the Committee trusts that the findings of the ongoing evaluation by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services (see para. 6 below) will also address the  aforementioned matters.        II. Observations and recommendations of the  Advisory Committee        1.  Reviews by internal and external oversight bodies        Office of Internal Oversight Services    6.  The Secretary-General indicates that the Office of Internal Oversight Services  (OIOS) is currently conducting an evaluation of the United Nations accountability  system to determine the extent to which the system is relevant, efficient and effective  in ensuring that the Secretariat: (a) fully implements all mandates approved by the  intergovernmental bodies and subsidiary organs; and (b) produces high-quality results  in a timely and efficient manner. This review will be finalized by June 2021  (A/75/686, para. 5). For this purpose, a questionnaire with respect to the changes in  workload and responsibilities resulting from the enhanced delegation of authority was  developed and integrated into the OIOS evaluation (ibid., para. 57). Upon enquiry,  the Advisory Committee was informed that the scope of the evaluation included an  in-depth analysis of the main elements of the four components of the accountability  system, namely: component II: programme, planning and budget documents;  component III: results and performance; component IV: internal control systems; and  component V: ethical standards and integrity. The other two components, the Charter  of the United Nations (component I) and oversight functions (component VI) are not  included in the evaluation. The Committee was furthermore informed that it was  expected that the results of the evaluation would provide a road map for the  Secretariat to review and adjust any components that might not be functioning as  intended.  7.  As indicated by the Secretary-General in his report, the Business  Transformation and Accountability Division of the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance has been operationalized and has undertaken a  number of activities, including a review of the 16 key performance indicators; an  analysis of procurement functions to identify inaccurately issued subdelegations and  ensure alignment between Umoja roles requiring a subdelegation and the related  subdelegations in the delegation of authority portal; quarterly checks to identify  conflicting delegations of authority; and the introduction of a training programme for  staff with delegated responsibilities (A/75/686, paras. 50-60).  8.  The Advisory Committee looks forward to the results of the evaluation by  the Office of Internal Oversight Services, including on the role and the  functioning of the Business Transformation and Accountability Division of the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, and expects that  the related findings will be presented in the eleventh progress report of the  Secretary-General on the accountability system.        Joint Inspection Unit    9.  Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, in 2021, the Joint  Inspection Unit would conduct a system-wide assessment of the accountability  frameworks of United Nations system organizations. The Advisory Committee looks  forward to the results of the review by the Joint Inspection Unit and trusts that  the Secretary-General will address the related findings in conjunction with the  A/75/804      21-03167  4/8    results of the aforementioned evaluation, in particular as they relate to lessons  learned and best practices from other United Nations system organizations.        Board of Auditors    10. The observations and recommendations of the Board of Auditors are contained  in its annual reports on the financial reports and audited financial statements of the  United Nations, relating to volume I (United Nations) and volume II (peacekeeping  operations). The Advisory Committee recalls that it has stressed that the full and  timely implementation of recommendations of oversight bodies is an integral  part of the accountability system, in particular of performance evaluations in the  context of senior managers' compacts, and that the Business Transformation and  Accountability Division should ensure the use of lessons learned and data  analysis as a result of oversight bodies' reports (see A/74/741, paras. 36-37). A  long-term analysis of the recommendations that were issued by the Board of Auditors  over a 10-year period indicates a number of recurring issues pertaining to property  management, human resources management and financial management, as well as the  cost-effective use of resources (A/75/686, paras. 102-112). The Advisory Committee  intends to follow up on long-outstanding recommendations in its current  consideration of the report of the Board of Auditors on the financial report and audited  financial statements of United Nations peacekeeping operations for the 12-month  period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020 (A/75/5 (Vol. II), and in its consideration,  during the fourth quarter of 2021, of the report of the Board of Auditors on the  financial reports and audited financial statements of the United Nations for the year  ended 31 December 2020 (A/76/5 (Vol. I).  11.  The Secretary-General indicates that the statement of internal control will be  issued in 2021 for 2020 for all entities, including field operations of the Secretariat,  and that the Board of Auditors will be consulted in its implementation (A/75/686,  paras. 74-78). The Advisory Committee notes that the statement of internal  control has not yet been implemented and looks forward to the review of the  Board of Auditors once the statement has been operationalized.        Intergovernmental bodies    12. Progress in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 74/271 and a  summary of the status of implementation of resolutions on administrative and  budgetary matters adopted by the Assembly at its seventy-fourth session are set out,  respectively, in annexes I and II of the report of the Secretary-General. The Advisory  Committee notes that a number of matters remain a work-in-progress and  stresses the importance of timely implementation of the decisions and  recommendations of intergovernmental bodies, including the recommendations  of the Committee which were endorsed by the General Assembly in its relevant  resolutions.      2.  Activities, initiatives and pilot projects    13. A summary of the progress in the implementation of the action plan for the  implementation of results-based management in the United Nations Secretariat from  2018 to 2021 is set out in annex III of the report of the Secretary-General. The  Advisory Committee notes that the accountability system is being continuously  enhanced and refined with new measures and concepts, for example, through  streamlining policies and providing additional technical capabilities and data mining  resources, aimed at strengthening the overall accountability system in the United  Nations Secretariat. The Advisory Committee considers that it is not evident how,  and if, the totality of the activities, initiatives and pilot projects are linked to the  development of a strong culture of accountability in the United Nations    A/75/804    5/8  21-03167    Secretariat and to the ongoing oversight of the delegation of authority. The  Committee recalls its view that it is essential to align workplans with approved  programme activities arising from established mandates, while also monitoring  the performance and accountability of individuals and entities against the  implementation of mandated activities (A/75/765, paras. 27-28). The Committee  recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to  provide information, including on how the implementation of results-based  management and results-based budgeting and their potential alignment across  the three related sources of funding can come together to form a sustainable and  holistic system of accountability.  14. Furthermore, as part of the Umoja Extension 2, the performance dashboard was  rolled out to peacekeeping missions, with a visual link between the strategic plan,  programme performance and budget consumption, and post incumbency data.  (A/75/686, paras. 15-20). Also, the two-year pilot project of the Comprehensive  Performance Assessment System was completed in July 2020, in close consultation  with eight field missions, whose feedback confirmed that the system had met its  objective as an effective tool and had improved integration among the civilian, police  and military components. (ibid., paras. 15-21). The Advisory Committee recalls  that the General Assembly, in paragraph 11 of resolution 74/271, encouraged the  Secretary-General to further increase the use of data to inform decision-making  and improve organizational performance, and to report on the impact of the  effective use of data on shifting the Organization to a culture of results in his  next progress report. The Committee notes the efforts to strengthen the  accountability system with new initiatives and data mining approaches. The  Committee looks forward to the findings of the evaluation currently being  conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The Committee trusts  that information thereon will be provided in the next progress report of the  Secretary-General.      3.  Human resources        Senior managers' compacts    15. The Secretary-General indicates that new indicators have recently been included  in the senior managers' compacts, including with respect to the statement of internal  controls; providing a safe and healthy workplace for mission personnel; the  consideration of placement of qualified staff affected by downsizing; and  strengthening the area of leadership accountability on conduct and discipline,  including preventing and addressing sexual exploitation and abuse of authority. The  Secretary-General indicates that, with regard to timely submission of documentation  to the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management, in 2019,  92 per cent of senior managers have met the threshold of 90 per cent of documentation  submitted on time (ibid., paras. 26-30). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was  informed that all senior managers were required to provide all documentation for the  consideration of the Committee no later than the scheduled submission dates agreed  by the Committee.  16. The Advisory Committee notes that the indicator on the implementation of  oversight body recommendations in the compacts of senior managers will be  strengthened and trusts this will result in increased efforts by senior managers  in implementing the recommendations of oversight bodies. The Committee  considers, however, that the reported high rate of timely submission of  documentation still does not reflect the operational reality of the oftentimes  delayed submission of documents by the secretariat to the Committee. The  Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in paragraph 16 of resolution  74/271, reiterated, inter alia, that the timely submission of documents is an  A/75/804      21-03167  6/8    important aspect of the accountability of the Secretariat to Member States, and  requested the Secretary-General to ensure the continued inclusion in the senior  managers' compacts of a related managerial indicator, and to provide  information in his next progress report on how this indicator is used to improve  senior managers' accountability in the timely submission of documents (see also  A/74/741, paras. 37-39). The Committee also recalls that, in its previous report,  it stressed that failure to hold senior managers to account has a negative impact  on the enforcement of accountability among staff at every level (ibid., para. 20).  The Advisory Committee has provided further comments on senior managers'  compacts in its report on the overview of human resources management reform for  the period 2019-2020 and an outlook beyond (A/75/765, paras. 29-30).        Performance appraisal and management    17. The Advisory Committee recalls its view that the current performance ratings  distribution, with over 99 per cent of staff members rated under the two categories of  ""exceeds expectations"" or ""meets expectations"" (A/75/765, paras. 31-36), may not  be an accurate reflection of staff performance (A/74/741, para. 24). The Committee  was informed, upon enquiry, that the pilot for the so-called agile performance  management approach, aimed at improving the objectivity and credibility of the  performance management framework, has been concluded, with the outcome  currently under review and a roll-out date in the 2021-2022 performance cycle (see  also A/75/686, paras. 31-36). The Advisory Committee recalls its recommendation  in its report on the overview of human resources management reform for the  period 2019-2020 and an outlook beyond, that more information and clarification  should be provided to the General Assembly on the current pilot implementation  phase of the performance management system improvements, such as the  consideration of introducing a grading curve for performance ratings, as well as  the financial implications, if any (see also A/75/765, paras. 35-36).        Staff engagement survey (2019)    18. The Secretary-General indicates that more than 18,000 staff members (or 52 per  cent of staff) participated in the second staff engagement survey conducted in 2019  (A/75/686, paras. 47-49). The results showed that only 49 per cent of staff responded  favourably to the question ""People at all levels in the United Nations Secretariat are  treated with respect"". The Advisory Committee stresses that senior managers are  responsible and accountable for ensuring that staff are treated with respect and  work in a conducive environment.      4.  Managing the risk of fraud and corruption        Cross-functional task force and preparation of the anti-fraud and  anti-corruption guidebook    19. A fraud and corruption risk assessment conducted in 2019, as part of the overall  Secretariat-wide risk assessment, highlighted six critical risks related to fraud and  corruption: (a) organizational culture; (b) information and communications  technology governance and cybersecurity; (c) implementing partners; (d) the Umoja  system control environment; (e) the theft of fuel, rations and inventory; and  (f) procurement fraud. After the task force, which was established to prepare an  anti-fraud and anti-corruption guidebook, was suspended owing to the coronavirus  disease (COVID-19) pandemic, all issues related to the examination of anti-fraud and  anti-corruption matters were assigned to a working group of the Secretariat-wide risk  assessment. In addition, in March 2020, the High-Level Committee on Management,  at its thirty-ninth session, endorsed the establishment of a cross-functional task force  on managing fraud risk, which has also considered the best practices on fraud risk    A/75/804    7/8  21-03167    management, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021, the  Secretariat plans to, inter alia: (a) define risk treatment and response plans for all  critical risks, inducing fraud and corruption risks by the end of the first quarter of  2021; and (b) prepare the aforementioned anti-fraud and anti-corruption guidebook  and strategy by the end of the second quarter of 2021, as also recommended by the  Board of Auditors (A/75/686, paras. 69-75).  20. The Advisory Committee looks forward to an update, in the context of the  next progress report of the Secretary-General, on the work of the  cross-functional task force on managing fraud risk. Furthermore, the Committee  trusts that details with respect to the anti-fraud and anti-corruption guidebook  and strategy, including how the guidelines will be disseminated and how their  implementation will be monitored, will be presented in the next progress report.  The Advisory Committee intends to further follow up on fraud- and corruption-related  matters during its consideration, in the fourth quarter of 2021, of the report of the  Board of Auditors on the financial reports and audited financial statements of the  United Nations for the year ended 31 December 2020.        Guidelines for implementing partners    21. The Advisory Committee recalls that that the guidelines for agreements with  implementing partners were to be issued in March 2020 (see A/74/741, para. 29) and  notes that issuance of the final version of the guidelines is now planned for the second  quarter of 2021 (A/75/686, paras. 61-62). Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed  that the guidelines would be issued specifically for United Nations Secretariat entities  and would take into account the Secretariat's legislative framework, regulations,  rules, policies and business processes, and also address fraud-related risks. The  Advisory Committee trusts that an update on the details with respect to the  guidelines for agreements with implementing partners, including how they will  be disseminated and their implementation monitored, will be presented in the  next progress report.      5.  Environmental sustainability    22. The Advisory Committee notes that the subject of an environmentally  sustainable Secretariat has not been included in the present progress report of the  Secretary-General but recalls that the subject was addressed in the ninth progress  report, in which a number of related steps were described, including: (a) the  promulgation of an environmental policy for the United Nations Secretariat (see  ST/SGB/2019/7); and (b) the adoption by the Secretariat of its own climate action  plan, including a 45 per cent reduction in the Secretariat's carbon footprint by 2030.  Concerning the carbon neutrality of the United Nations, at that time, the Committee  was informed, upon enquiry, that the Organization's annual performance on  greenhouse gas emissions was measured as part of the United Nations system  environmental inventory initiative, which is coordinated by the United Nations  Environment Programme4 (A/74/741, paras. 16-17). Upon enquiry, the Committee  was informed that the efforts to achieve an environmentally sustainable Secretariat  currently included the second phase (2020-2023) of the implementation of the  environment strategy for field missions; and standard operating procedures for peace  operations on waste management plans and on energy infrastructure management  plans. The Committee was furthermore informed, also upon enquiry, that the main  achievements of the Business Transformation and Accountability Division included  promulgating an environmental policy for the United Nations Secretariat in  __________________    4 The most recent report on greenhouse gas emissions is available at www.greeningtheblue.org/  reports/greening-blue-report-2020.  A/75/804      21-03167  8/8    September 2019; the adoption by the Secretariat of its own climate action plan, which  sets eight targets, including a 45 per cent reduction in the Secretariat's carbon  footprint by 2030; and the achievement in 2019 of the Secretariat's carbon neutrality  certificate for its global operations.  23. The Advisory Committee trusts that environmental sustainability will  extend to the entire United Nations Secretariat. The Committee recommends that  the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to include in future  progress reports specific information on outcomes, results and financial  implications, including costs and benefits for the United Nations Secretariat and  for peacekeeping operations. The Committee will continue to address the matter of  environmental sustainability and management in various contexts, including in the  context of its report on the proposed programme budget for 2022 and in its report on  observations and recommendations on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping  operations, as well as in its reports on individual peacekeeping missions.      6.  Impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic    24. As described in the report of the Secretary-General, the onset of the COVID-19  pandemic in 2020 has impacted the progress in some accountability-related measures,  such as the implementation of the second phase of the agile performance management  pilot, which was temporarily delayed but has now proceeded (A/75/686, para. 32).  The Secretary-General also indicates that the Secretariat plans to engage with the  main groups of Member States on the format of the proposed programme budget for  2022 and that the respective budget proposals and performance reports will  incorporate information on the impact of the liquidity crisis and the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, as per General Assembly resolutions 75/243 and  75/252. The Committee was furthermore informed that the COVID-19-related impact  on the accountability efforts and their progress was a result of the change of working  methods, with mandatory telecommuting, as well as the need to redirect internal  human resources capacity to address a number of urgent administrative needs  regarding COVID-19, such as the preparation of new COVID-19-related  administrative guidelines and policy guidance.  25. The Advisory Committee recalls its comments and recommendations on the  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its first report on the proposed programme  budget for 2021, including its request that the Secretary-General provide more  information on the impact of the pandemic in the next proposed programme budget,  inter alia, on lessons learned, best practices, efficiency measures, harmonization and  cooperation across the United Nations system (A/75/7, chap. I, paras. 12-15).        III. Recommendations      26. The action requested by the Secretary-General to be taken by the General  Assembly is set out in paragraph 115 of the report of the Secretary-General. With  respect to the evaluation of the United Nations accountability system, currently  conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and to be concluded in  June 2021, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly  request the Secretary-General to present the findings, including any financial  implications, in the eleventh progress report on the accountability system.  Subject to its observations and recommendations in the paragraphs above, the  Committee recommends that the Assembly request the Secretary-General to  present in future progress reports, the specific outcomes (including specific  instances when staff and senior managers were held accountable and the  resulting actions), quantitative and qualitative results, and associated costs, as  they pertain to the various components of the accountability system.

They shall provide an independent view through inspec- tion and evaluation aimed at improving management and meth- ods and at achieving greater co-ordination between organiza- tions.  3. The Unit shall satisfy itself that the activities under- taken by the organizations are carried out in the most eco- nomical manner and that the optimum use is made of resources  available for carrying out these activities.  4.  Without prejudice to the principle that external evalua- tion remains the responsibility of appropriate intergovern- mental bodies, the Unit, with due regard to its other respon- sibilities, may assist them in carrying out their responsibilities  for external evaluation of programmes and activities.

In the  case of the United Nations, the Unit shall, when possible, in- dicate to which organs of the United Nations a report is of  essential concern and the Secretary-General shall take this into  account when distributing it. The Advisory Committee on Ad- ministrative and Budgetary Questions shall receive all reports  for information. As it deems appropriate, the Advisory Com- mittee may choose to issue comments and observations on any  of the reports which fall within its competence;  ( e)  When a report concerns more than one organization,  the respective executive heads shall, normally within the frame- work of the Administrative Committee on Co-ordination, con- sult with one another and, to the extent possible, co-ordinate  their comments. The report, together with the joint comments  and any comments of the respective executive heads on matters  that concern their particular organizations, shall be ready for  submission to the competent organs of the organizations not  later than six months after receipt of the Unit's report for  consideration at the next meeting of the competent organs  concerned.

Notes and confidential letters shall be submitted to  executive heads for use by them as they may decide.  Article 12  Executive heads of organizations shall ensure that recom- mendations of the Unit approved by their respective competent  organs are implemented as expeditiously as possible. Such im- plementation may be subject to verification by the competent  organs of the organizations, which may also request the Unit  to issue follow-up reports.

"accountability","  United Nations    ST/IC/2016/25      Secretariat    9 September 2016      16-15827 (E)    190916      *1615827*         Information circular*      To: Members of the staff      From: The Under-Secretary-General for Management      Subject: Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the   United Nations Secretariat      1.  The purpose of the present information circular is to inform all staff of the  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat,  which has been prepared in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 69/249  and 70/255.  2.  The objective of the Framework is to assist the Secretariat in promoting a  culture of integrity and honesty within the Organization by providing guidance and  information to staff members and other United Nations Secretariat personnel 1 on  how the Secretariat acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption.  3.  Staff members at all levels are expected to become familiar with the contents  of the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework and to comply with the guidance  and principles established therein. They must also be aware that committing acts of  this nature will lead to disciplinary measures that may range from written censure to  dismissal.  4.  The issuance of this policy will be accompanied by a communications  campaign Secretariat-wide to raise awareness about fraudulent acts and on how the  Secretariat's acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption, and to ensure that relevant risks are effectively mitigated.         __________________    * Information circulars will be subsequently issued to inform staff members of updates to the  Framework that might be introduced through changes in the Secretariat's regulations, rules,  administrative instructions and standard operating procedures.     1 Other United Nations Secretariat personnel include officials other than Secretariat officials and  experts on mission, individual contractors, consultants, interns, gratis personnel, participants in  advisory meetings, ""when actually employed"" personnel and United Nations Volunteers.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  2/32    Annex       Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the  United Nations Secretariat         Summary    Combating fraud and corruption in the United Nations Secretariat is a primary  responsibility of staff, including management, and other United Nations Secretariat  personnel, and is a responsibility that the Secretariat also applies to its relationship  with third parties.     The Secretariat takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption  involving its staff members, other personnel and third parties in relation to their work  with the Secretariat. This means that all allegations of fraudulent acts committed by  any individual or entity involved in a contractual relationship with the Organization  will be vigorously pursued.    ""Fraudulent acts"" include both ""fraud"" and ""corruption"". Fraud encompasses  any act or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or  conceals a material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself,  herself, itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment.  Corruption encompasses any act or omission that misuses official authority or seeks  to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue benefit for  oneself or a third party.    Fraudulent acts are considered misconduct. In the case of staff members, such  acts will lead to disciplinary measures that may range from written censure to  dismissal. Other measures may include the financial recovery of losses to the  Organization and the referral of credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing to  national authorities, when appropriate. Other United Nations personnel may also be  the subject of sanctions for this type of misconduct as defined in the Framework.    Staff members -- and other United Nations personnel -- have the duty to  report any and all possible cases of fraudulent acts either to the Head of Office/  Mission or responsible officer, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management or the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). OIOS has a  dedicated hotline whereby cases may be reported in a confidential manner:  https://oios.un.org/page?slug=reporting-wrongdoing.     The Secretariat is obliged to protect the confidentiality of those reporting  alleged cases of fraudulent acts. It has in place a protection against retaliation policy  that applies to staff members, interns and United Nations Volunteers who have  reported misconduct. Other United Nations personnel should adhere to the provisions  of their respective contracts in this respect.    OIOS is the main entity typically responsible for conducting investigations of  high-risk cases involving complex matters and/or serious criminal cases, including  serious or complex fraud. Lower-risk cases are typically handled by programme  managers or other dedicated investigative bodies.    ST/IC/2016/25    3/32  16-15827      The Secretariat reports to Member States on all cases of fraud through reports  to the General Assembly and the Board of Auditors. In its reports, OIOS refers to  specific investigations of possible misconduct, including fraudulent acts. In addition,  the Secretariat reports on a yearly basis cases of misconduct and/or criminal  behaviour and the disciplinary consequences thereof, as well as cases involving  credible allegations of criminal conduct against United Nations officials and experts  on mission that have been referred to their States of nationality.

The Charter of the United Nations states that the ""paramount consideration in  the employment of the staff and in the determination of the conditions of service  shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence  and integrity..."" (Article 101). The promotion and maintenance of a culture of  integrity and honesty is a basic requirement for combating fraud and corruption and  a primary responsibility of staff, including management, in the United Nations  Secretariat.  2.  The Secretariat takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption  involving its staff members, other personnel or third parties in relation to their work  with the Secretariat. ""Zero tolerance"" means that the Secretariat will pursue all  allegations of fraudulent acts involving any individual or entity covered by the  regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies, procedures and agreements  described in the Framework and that appropriate administrative/disciplinary  measures or contractual remedies will be applied if wrongdoing is established. In  addition, certain matters involving credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing may  be referred to national authorities when appropriate.        II. Purpose      3.  The purpose of the Framework is to assist the Secretariat in promoting a  culture of integrity and honesty within the Organization by providing guidance and  information to staff members and other United Nations Secretariat personnel2 on  how the Secretariat acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption. Other United Nations Secretariat personnel include officials other than  Secretariat officials and experts on mission, individual contractors, consultants,  interns, gratis personnel, participants in advisory meetings, ""when actually  employed"" personnel and United Nations Volunteers. The Framework describes the  Organization's existing regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and  procedures in these areas, including the roles and responsibilities of personnel and  the applicable sanctions.3 In addition, the Framework refers to third parties, who are  obliged to comply with all obligations related to fraudulent acts that are included in  their applicable agreements with the Secretariat.  4.  The Framework should be read in conjunction with the documents and  provisions referenced in annex I, ""Relevant sections of United Nations official  documentation related to fraudulent acts""; annex II, ""List of important treaties,  instruments, regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and manuals  governing fraudulent acts in the United Nations""; and annex III, ""Categories of  non-United Nations personnel not covered by the Framework"".      __________________    2 This category does not include: United Nations military experts on mission, including military  observers, military advisers and military liaison officers; United Nations police officers;  members of formed police units; government-provided personnel; and contingent personnel.  Information related to these categories of non-United Nations personnel is included in annex III  to the Framework.    3 See, in particular, the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Towards an accountability system  in the United Nations Secretariat"" (A/64/640).    ST/IC/2016/25    5/32  16-15827      III. Definitions      5.  For the purpose of the Framework, the term ""fraudulent acts"" in the United  Nations Secretariat is intended to include both ""fraud"", which encompasses any act  or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or conceals a  material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself, herself,  itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment; and  ""corruption"", which encompasses any act or omission that misuses official authority  or that seeks to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue  benefit for oneself or a third party.   6.  Examples of fraudulent acts may include, but are not limited to, the following  acts, which are listed below for illustrative purposes:4    (a)  Submitting falsified documentation;    (b)  Improperly creating and using a document that purportedly authorizes a  staff member or a third party to remove property belonging to the Organization;    (c)  Misrepresenting educational qualifications;    (d)  Making material omissions or false inclusions in personal history profiles  (PHPs);    (e)  Knowingly submitting an education grant, a medical, travel or other  entitlement claim and documentation containing false information;    (f)  Knowingly  including  false  information  in  movement-related  documentation submitted to the Organization;    (g)  Declaring private telecommunications charges to be official;    (h)  Improperly assisting a person external to the Organization to secure  United Nations employment in exchange for money or other favours;     (i)  Improperly assisting a vendor in a procurement process;    (j)  Manipulating a procurement or recruitment process to ensure a certain  outcome;    (k)  Misusing United Nations resources to benefit oneself or a third party;     (l)  Soliciting or accepting bribes;     (m) Revealing internal confidential information in order to obtain a benefit  for oneself or a third party;    (n)  Participating in the recruitment process of a family member or a person  with respect to whom one has an undisclosed conflict of interest;     (o)  Participating in a procurement and/or contract management process  involving a person or entity with whom/which one has an undisclosed conflict of  interest;  __________________    4 Additional examples more specifically related to ""third parties"" are included in sect. X, para. 61,  below.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  6/32      (p)  Manipulating administrative processes to disburse payments to benefit  oneself or a third party, such as by creating fake contracts, fake third-party  beneficiaries or ghost employees;    (q)  Improperly altering the labelling on the salary envelopes of individual  contractors and removing cash from the envelopes, all without authorization;    (r)  Taking property of the United Nations Secretariat without authorization.   7.  Established ""fraudulent acts"" in the United Nations Secretariat are considered  to be ""misconduct"", and article X of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules,  ""Disciplinary measures"", and staff rules 10.1 and 10.2 clearly state the actions that  the Secretariat takes with regard to staff who engage in this type of behaviour. In  addition, sections IX and X below clearly define the actions that are taken in cases  involving other United Nations Secretariat personnel and third parties (including  implementing partners, vendors and non-State donors).        IV. Scope      8.  The Framework is applicable to fraudulent acts throughout the United Nations  Secretariat, which includes peacekeeping missions and special political missions.  The roles of particular actors within the Secretariat are summarized below:    (a)  The Secretary-General, as the chief administrative officer of the United  Nations, is ultimately accountable for the establishment and management of an  effective system for the prevention and detection of, as well as the enforcement of  measures against, fraudulent acts; response to allegations of fraudulent acts; and the  effectiveness of the system of related internal controls in this regard within the  United Nations;5     (b)  Heads of department/office and programme managers are accountable to  the Secretary-General and have the delegated responsibility for ensuring that the  existing internal control system, including all measures aimed at preventing and  detecting fraudulent acts, is functioning effectively; that all measures aimed at  preventing and detecting fraudulent acts are put in place; and that an appropriate  and robust internal control environment is maintained, including those components  related to integrity and ethical values, compliance requirements and disclosure. The  Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management is responsible for reviewing  and updating the Framework as required;     (c)  All staff members are expected to be aware that fraudulent acts, whatever  their extent and form, are contrary to the standards of conduct expected of  international civil servants and, if established, constitute misconduct, as provided  for in staff rule 10.1 of chapter X, ""Disciplinary measures"", of the Staff Regulations  and Rules, for which a staff member may be sanctioned and even dismissed (see  staff regulation 10.1 and staff rule 10.2). In addition, pursuant to staff rule 1.2 (c),  staff members have the duty to report cases of suspected misconduct, including  suspected fraudulent acts, to either a head of department/office, the Assistant  __________________    5 See Charter of the United Nations, Articles 97, 100 and 101; and the report of the Secretary- General entitled ""Towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat""  (A/64/640).    ST/IC/2016/25    7/32  16-15827    Secretary-General for Human Resources Management 6 or the Office of Internal  Oversight Services (OIOS);    (d)  Other categories of United Nations Secretariat personnel7 are governed  by the relevant applicable provisions, in particular consultants and individual  contractors,8 interns,9 United Nations Volunteers under the applicable rules of the  United Nations Development Programme,10 officials other than Secretariat officials  and experts on mission, 11 gratis personnel, 12 participants in advisory meetings, 13  personnel on non-reimbursable loans from sources external to the United Nations  common system14 and ""when actually employed"" personnel;15    (e)  The four internal and external oversight bodies that cover the United  Nations Secretariat are: OIOS, the Board of Auditors, the Joint Inspection Unit and  the Independent Audit Advisory Committee. Those bodies have been established by  the General Assembly to assist in promoting a culture of compliance and integrity  and in deterring fraudulent acts by independently assessing the adequacy and  effectiveness of the internal control systems and, in the case of OIOS, undertaking  investigations into possible cases of fraudulent acts, as appropriate.        V. Prevention measures for fraudulent acts      9.  The Organization has established a comprehensive framework of measures to  prevent cases of fraudulent acts, as listed below.        A. Standards of conduct      10. All United Nations staff members must uphold the standards of conduct that  are prescribed, in particular in the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff  Regulations16 and Rules and the relevant administrative issuances as listed in annex  I to the Framework. Under Article 100 of the Charter, the staff ""shall not seek or  receive instructions from any government or from any other authority external to the  Organization. They shall refrain from any action which might reflect on their  position as international officials responsible only to the Organization"".  __________________    6 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    7 See sect. IX below.    8 See ST/AI/2013/4, on consultants and individual contractors.    9 See ST/AI/2014/1, on the United Nations internship programme.    10 See Conditions of Service for International United Nations Volunteers and the memorandum of  understanding between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the United Nations  Volunteers.    11 See Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat  Officials, and Experts on Mission (ST/SGB/2002/9).    12 See ST/AI/1999/6, on gratis personnel.    13 See ST/AI/2013/5, on participants in advisory meetings.    14 See ST/AI/231/Rev.1, on non-reimbursable loans of personnel services from sources external to  the United Nations common system.    15 See ST/SGB/283, on the use of ""when actually employed"" contracts for special representatives,  envoys and other special high-level positions"".

Under staff regulation 1.1, staff members must make a written declaration that  they will, inter alia, exercise ""in all loyalty, discretion and conscience"" the functions  entrusted to them as international civil servants of the United Nations, discharge  those functions and regulate their conduct ""with the interests of the United Nations  only in view"" and respect the obligations incumbent upon them as set out in the  Staff Regulations and Rules.   12. Under staff regulation 1.2, staff members must uphold the highest standards of  efficiency, competence and integrity. It is specified that ""the concept of integrity  includes, but is not limited to, probity, impartiality, fairness, honesty and  truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and status"". Moreover, staff  regulation 1.2 (g) provides that staff members ""shall not use their office or  knowledge gained from their official functions for private gain, financial or  otherwise, or for the private gain of any third party, including family, friends and  those they favour. Nor shall staff members use their office for personal reasons to  prejudice the positions of those they do not favour"".  13. Standards of conduct are repeated and explained further in the Staff Rules 17  and in the Secretary-General's bulletin on the status, basic rights and duties of  United Nations staff members.18 Staff shall also be guided by the International Civil  Service Commission Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service. 19  14. Similar high standards of conduct are required of other United Nations  personnel, as outlined in the Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and  Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission 20 or in  the applicable administrative issuances (see para. 8 (d) above) and provisions  contained in their respective contracts.  15. Standards of conduct for other United Nations Secretariat personnel and third  parties are set forth in their respective contracts.         B. Protection against retaliation      16. The Secretary-General issued a specific administrative issuance prohibiting  retaliation for reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits  or investigations.21 It sets forth protective measures for staff members, interns and  United Nations Volunteers under threat of, or experiencing, retaliation for duly  reporting misconduct or for cooperating with duly authorized audits or  investigations. The protective measures may include measures to safeguard the  interests of the complainant pending the completion of the investigation, such as  temporary suspension of the implementation of the action reported as retaliatory and  temporary reassignment of the complainant.22 If the Ethics Office finds that there is  a credible case of retaliation or threat of retaliation, it will refer the matter in  writing to OIOS for investigation and immediately notify the complainant in writing  __________________    17 See Staff Rules and Staff Regulations of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2016/1).    18 ST/SGB/2016/9.    19 See http://icsc.un.org/resources/pdfs/general/standardsE.pdf.    20 ST/SGB/2002/9.    21 ST/SGB/2005/21.    22 Ibid., sect. 5.6.    ST/IC/2016/25    9/32  16-15827    of that referral. All complaints are handled according to specific procedures that  ensure confidentiality and prompt and proper attention.  17. Any retaliatory measures by a United Nations staff member against a  contractor or his or her employees, agents or representatives, or any other individual  dealing with the United Nations, as a result of that person's reporting misconduct by  a United Nations staff member will likewise be considered misconduct that, if  established, will lead to disciplinary or other appropriate action.  18. The Secretariat is obliged to protect the confidentiality of the individual's  identity and all communications related to misconduct that have been made through  the channels established in paragraph 16 above to the maximum extent possible. 23        C. Risk management      19. Enterprise risk management is a comprehensive process designed to identify,  assess and respond to risks, including fraudulent acts, that could affect the ability of  the Secretariat to effectively achieve its mandates and objectives.  20. While the ultimate responsibility for effective risk and internal control  management within the Secretariat resides with the Secretary-General, every  manager in the Secretariat is responsible for identifying and mitigating the risks that  might affect the operations under his or her responsibility. Systematic fraud risk  assessments should be undertaken in accordance with the Secretariat's enterprise  risk management and internal control policy and methodology. 24 Such analysis  should include known fraud risk factors, potential fraud schemes, control gaps, red  flag identification and mapping. Technical advice on the implementation of  enterprise risk management is available from the Office of the Under-Secretary- General for Management.         D. Internal control system      21. The United Nations internal control system25 is composed of regulations, rules,  administrative issuances, policies, processes and procedures of the Secretariat,  which staff members are obliged to respect, and is designed to provide assurance  regarding the achievement of organizational objectives, adequate resource  utilization, reliable financial reporting and compliance with relevant regulations,  rules and policies, including preventing and detecting fraudulent acts. The system  includes, but is not limited to:    (a)  The regulations, rules and administrative issuances of the Secretariat,  which include:  __________________    23 Ibid., sect. 3. The established internal mechanisms for reporting misconduct are OIOS, the  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, the head of the department or  office concerned or the focal point appointed to receive reports of sexual exploitation and abuse.    24 The enterprise risk management policy is set out in the report of the Secretary-General on  progress towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat (A/66/692), and  information on the enterprise risk management methodology is available on iSeek.    25 See the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Towards an accountability system in the United  Nations Secretariat"" (A/64/640) and General Assembly resolution 64/259.

The latter comprises two levels of independent judicial review: the  United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal. Relevant  legislation includes the statutes and rules of both Tribunals;39    (e)  The four internal and external oversight bodies that cover the Secretariat  are described in section IV, paragraph 8 (e), above. Of these four, OIOS is the main  internal body that conducts investigations in the Secretariat. OIOS has established a  mechanism to enable allegations to be reported directly to it at https://oios.un.org/  page?slug=reporting-wrongdoing. OIOS is typically responsible for investigating  serious misconduct, including serious or complex fraudulent acts.40        E. Fraud and corruption awareness programme      22. To ensure that the risk of fraud and corruption is effectively mitigated, the  Secretariat implements a communications campaign to raise awareness about  fraudulent acts and their prevention. The Ethics Office promotes an anti-fraud/  anti-corruption culture by fostering an organizational culture of integrity,  transparency and accountability, providing confidential ethics advice to all staff,  including managers, on appropriate standards of conduct and including fraud and  corruption awareness components in its ethics training programmes.  23. In addition, the United Nations intranet site provides information related to the  prevention of fraudulent acts, including common or frequently asked questions and  answers, hotlines, training materials and relevant documentation such as the  Organization's administrative instructions and Secretary-General's bulletins. All  staff members are encouraged to visit the intranet site and familiarize themselves  with its contents.   24. All staff members are expected to complete the mandatory online anti-fraud  training when it is available.     __________________    37 See ST/SGB/2016/7, on terms of reference for the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and  Mediation Services.    38 The Management Evaluation Unit is within the Department of Management and evaluates  managerial decision-making to ensure that it is in accordance with the relevant regulations, rules  and administrative issuances and identifies emerging trends and systemic problems so that  management can take swift corrective action.    39 See General Assembly resolution 62/228; ST/SGB/2010/3, on the organization and terms of  reference of the Office of Administration of Justice; and ST/SGB/2010/9, on the organization of  the Department of Management (sect. 10).    40 See General Assembly resolution 59/287.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  12/32      F. Prevention of conflicts of interest      25. As stated in staff regulation 1.2 (m), a conflict of interest occurs when a staff  member's personal interests interfere with the performance of his or her official  duties and responsibilities or with the integrity, independence and impartiality  required by the staff member's status as an international civil servant. When an  actual or possible conflict of interest does arise (see examples set out in sect. III,  paras. 6 (o) and (p), above), the conflict shall in the first instance be disclosed by  the staff member to his or her head of office, mitigated by the Organization and  resolved in favour of the interests of the Organization.  26. Staff regulation 1.2 (n) further establishes that all staff members at the  D-1 level and above shall be required to file financial disclosure statements 41 on  appointment and at intervals thereafter as prescribed by the Secretary-General, in  respect of themselves, their spouses and their dependent children, and to assist the  Secretary-General in verifying the accuracy of the information submitted when so  requested. The same obligation to file financial disclosure statements is imposed on  certain categories of other staff, including those designated by their heads of  department/office by a subsequent administrative issuance. 42        VI. Reporting fraudulent acts      27. Staff rule 1.2 (c)43 states:  ""Staff members have the duty to report any breach of the Organization's  regulations and rules to the officials whose responsibility it is to take  appropriate action...""  28. Fraudulent acts constitute a violation of the Staff Regulations and Rules and  relevant administrative issuances and, as a result, under staff rule 1.2 (c), any staff  member with information regarding possible wrongdoing in this regard that involves  United Nations property, assets, personnel or third parties is obliged to report the  matter either to the head of office/mission or the responsible officer, 44 the Assistant  __________________    41 The purpose of the United Nations Secretariat's financial disclosure programme, as administered  by the Ethics Office, is to protect the integrity and reputation of the Organization by ensuring  that potential conflicts of interest arising from the financial holdings, private affiliations or  outside activities of staff members can be identified and properly managed.    42 ST/SGB/2006/6 imposes this duty on staff at the D-1 or L-6 level and above, all staff of the  Ethics Office and other staff designated by their heads of department/office (including staff  whose principal duties involve procurement or investment of assets and other staff with direct  access to confidential procurement or investment information (sect. 2.1 (b), (c) and (d)) and  describes how the Organization may proceed against any staff member who fails to comply with  the filing of obligations under the disclosure programme.    43 See Staff Rules and Staff Regulations of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2016/1).    44 See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures. In the case of  peacekeeping missions, in addition to the above, cases can be reported to the commanding  officers in the missions or the heads of civilian, police or military components for onward  transmission to the head of mission and his or her supporting Conduct and Discipline Team or  the conduct and discipline focal point. The focal points on sexual exploitation and abuse are also  authorized to receive reports of cases of this nature.    ST/IC/2016/25    13/32  16-15827    Secretary-General for Human Resources Management45 or OIOS. OIOS can provide  advice on potential fraudulent acts and receive reports in a confidential manner  through the dedicated hotline, accessible at https://oios.un.org/page?slug=reporting- wrongdoing.  29. As noted above, the Secretariat has an established protection against  retaliation policy applicable to staff members, interns and United Nations  Volunteers who allege that they have been subjected to retaliation or the threat of  retaliation as a consequence of reporting misconduct or cooperating with a duly  authorized audit or investigation.46 Other United Nations personnel should adhere to  the provisions of their respective contracts in this regard.  30. United Nations military experts on mission, including military observers,  military advisers and military liaison officers; United Nations police officers;  members of formed police units; government-provided personnel; and contingent  personnel, information about whom is included in annex III to the Framework, are  not considered United Nations personnel. They are subject to the investigation and  disciplinary authorities and procedures of the contributing Member State.  Nonetheless, any staff member with information regarding any possible misconduct  involving this category of non-United Nations personnel is obliged to report the  matter to either the head of office/mission or a responsible officer,47 the Conduct  and Discipline Team 48 or OIOS.49 The United Nations, for its part, is obliged to  report, without delay, alleged misconduct, including fraudulent acts, by national  contingent members to their respective Governments.         VII. Investigations of allegations involving United Nations staff      31. Staff rule 1.2 (c), ""Basic rights and obligations of staff"", establishes that:  ""Staff members have the duty to report any breach of the Organization's  regulations and rules to the officials whose responsibility it is to take  appropriate action and to cooperate with duly authorized audits and  investigations. Staff members shall not be retaliated against for complying  with these duties.""  32. All allegations of misconduct -- including fraudulent acts -- are reviewed and  investigated, as appropriate, by the Secretariat. As stated in the administrative  __________________    45 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    46 See ST/SGB/2005/21. Protection against retaliation requests are to be filed with the Ethics  Office. If the Ethics Office determines a prima facie case of retaliation, it will refer the matter to  OIOS for investigation. The policy provides for interim and final retaliation protection measures,  and further prohibits retaliation against contractors or other third parties that report misconduct  by United Nations staff members (further information about the policy may be found in annex II  to the Framework).    47 See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures.    48 In the case of peacekeeping missions, in addition to the above, cases can be reported to the  commanding officers in the missions or the heads of civilian, police or military components for  onward transmission to the head of mission and his or her supporting Conduct and Discipline  Team or the conduct and discipline focal point.    49 See revised draft model memorandum of understanding (A/61/19 (Part III), annex).  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  14/32    instruction on revised disciplinary measures and procedures (ST/AI/371 and  Amend.1),50 heads of office/mission or responsible officers are obliged to undertake  investigations where there is reason to believe that a staff member has engaged in  possible misconduct for which a disciplinary measure may be imposed.   33. OIOS will typically conduct all investigations considered to be high-risk,  complex matters and serious criminal cases, including serious or complex fraudulent  acts.51        VIII. Actions based on investigations of allegations involving  United Nations staff      34. The Secretariat takes appropriate action (disciplinary/administrative and/or  referral to national authorities) against staff members on the basis of the results of  investigations into alleged misconduct.  35. Article X of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, ""Disciplinary measures"",  states, in regulation 10.1 (a), the following: ""The Secretary-General may impose  disciplinary measures on staff members who engage in misconduct"".  36. Staff rule 10.1 (a), ""Misconduct"", states that: ""Failure by a staff member to  comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff  Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances or to observe  the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant may amount to  misconduct and may lead to the institution of a disciplinary process and the  imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct.""  37. Financial rule 101.2 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations provides that ""[a]ll United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the  Financial Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in  connection with those Regulations and Rules. Any staff member who contravenes  the Financial Regulations and Rules or corresponding administrative instructions  may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions.""  38. Possible disciplinary measures range from written censure to dismissal. Other  measures may include the financial recovery of losses to the Organization and the  __________________    50 Currently under revision.    51 See the report of OIOS on strengthening the investigation functions in the United Nations  (A/58/708), which describes ""category I"" and ""category II"" cases, as classified by OIOS.  ""Category II"" cases are described as being of lower risk to the Organization and include the  following: personnel matters, traffic-related inquiries, simple thefts, contract disputes, office  management disputes, basic misuse of equipment or staff, basic mismanagement issues,  infractions of regulations, rules or administrative issuances and simple entitlement fraud. Such  cases can be handled by programme managers. If, however, there is an indication that the case  might involve possible illegal activity and the use of trained professional investigators is  considered essential, then the case should be handled by OIOS. Where programme managers are  entrusted with conducting investigations, the results of their investigations should be reported to  OIOS (see General Assembly resolution 59/287). ""Category I"" cases are classified as high-risk,  complex matters and serious criminal cases, including the following: serious or complex fraud,  other serious criminal act or activity, abuse of authority or staff, conflict of interest, gross  mismanagement, waste of substantial resources, cases involving risk of loss of life to staff or to  others, and substantial violation of United Nations regulations, rules or administrative issuances.  Such cases should be brought to the attention of, and investigated by, OIOS.    ST/IC/2016/25    15/32  16-15827    referral of credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing to national authorities, when  appropriate.   39. In addition, in General Assembly resolution 62/63, on criminal accountability  of United Nations officials and experts on mission, as well as subsequent  resolutions on the same topic, the Assembly requested that, where credible  allegations reveal that a crime may have been committed by United Nations officials  or experts on mission, they be brought by the Secretary-General to the attention of  the States against whose nationals such allegations are made. In addition, those  States should provide an indication of the status of their efforts to investigate and,  as appropriate, prosecute crimes of a serious nature, as well as the types of  appropriate assistance States may wish to receive from the Secretariat for the  purposes of such investigations and prosecutions.  40. In accordance with article 45 bis of the Regulations, Rules and Pension  Adjustment System of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, in cases where a  Pension Fund participant is the subject of a criminal conviction by a competent  national court for fraud against the United Nations, the Fund may, at the request of a  United Nations member organization, remit to the relevant United Nations member  organization a portion of the pension benefit payable to the participant.        IX. Investigation of allegations involving other United Nations  Secretariat personnel      41. Other United Nations Secretariat personnel are governed by the respective  applicable administrative issuances, in particular officials other than Secretariat  officials and experts on mission,52 consultants and individual contractors, 53 interns54  and United Nations Volunteers under the applicable rules of the United Nations  Development Programme.  42. Cases of possible misconduct -- including fraudulent acts -- involving these  categories of personnel should be reported to either the head of office/mission 55/  responsible official, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management56 or OIOS and should be investigated as appropriate, in accordance  with applicable procedures.  43. In the case of officials other than Secretariat officials and experts on mission,  their status, basic rights and duties are established in the Regulations Governing the  Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and  Experts on Mission. 57  The Regulations establish, among other principles, their  standards of conduct and to whom they are accountable. Such officials may also be  subject to applicable provisions established in their respective contracts.  __________________    52 Experts on mission include, e.g., United Nations police officers, members of formed police units,  corrections officers and military observers; see Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights  and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission (ST/SGB/2002/9).    53 See ST/AI/2013/4, on consultants and individual contractors.    54 See ST/AI/2014/1, on the United Nations internship programme.    55 Cases involving missions can also be reported to the Conduct and Discipline Team.    56 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    57 ST/SGB/2002/9.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  16/32    44. In addition, the obligations described in section VIII, paragraph 39, above in  relation to General Assembly resolution 62/63 apply to United Nations experts on  mission.   45. Special representatives, envoys and other special high-level positions may be  contracted by the Organization on short-term appointments or other types of  contracts 58 and on a ""when actually employed"" basis. In the case of short-term  appointments, the oath of office shall be attached to the letter of appointment for  signature by the holder. The oath of office states that, as a staff member, he or she is  subject to the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations during the days of  his or her service, with all the rights, obligations and accountability measures that  that entails. In the case of other types of contracts, the conditions of service are  stated in paragraph 46 below.  46. Other personnel can be contracted with special service agreements, as well as  on a ""when actually employed"" basis. Their conditions of service are set out in the  contract document and the provisions of the administrative instruction on  consultants and individual contractors.59 In addition, if the individual concerned also  has the status of expert on mission, he or she will also be subject to the Regulations  Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat  Officials, and Experts on Mission.   47. Finally, the provisions of the Secretary-General's bulletin governing the use of  ""when actually employed"" contracts for special representatives, envoys and other  special high-level positions 60 apply to short-term appointments or other types of  contracts as applicable.  48.  With respect to consultants and individual contractors, their duties, obligations  and systems of sanctions are defined in the administrative instruction governing the  contracting of consultants and individual contractors in the United Nations  Secretariat61 and in the general conditions of contracts for the services of consultants  and individual contractors that apply to this category of personnel and that are  incorporated into their individual contracts.   49. In the case of gratis personnel,62 the standards of conduct and accountability  measures to which they are subject are established in sections 11 and 12 of the  administrative instruction governing their relationship with the Secretariat.63  50. In the case of participants in advisory meetings, their terms and conditions are  set out in section 2 of the administrative instruction governing the relationship of  the Secretariat with this type of other United Nations personnel.64  __________________    58 Contract for the services of a consultant or individual contractor.    59 ST/AI/2013/4.    60 ST/SGB/283.    61 ST/AI/2013/4.    62 ""Gratis personnel"" refers to personnel who are provided to the United Nations by a Government  or other entity responsible for the remuneration of the services of such personnel and who do not  serve under any other established regime such as that applicable to interns, associate experts,  personnel provided on a non-reimbursable loan under the provisions of ST/AI/231/Rev.1 and  personnel provided to the United Nations Special Commission under the regime reported by the  Secretary-General to the Security Council in document S/22508 of 18 April 1991 (see  ST/AI/1999/6).    63 ST/AI/1999/6.    ST/IC/2016/25    17/32  16-15827    51. In the case of United Nations Volunteers, the basic terms of their conditions of  service, as well as their duties and obligations, including those related to  misconduct and disciplinary procedures, are established in the document entitled  ""Conditions of Service for International United Nations Volunteers"" and the  memorandum of understanding between the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations and the United Nations Volunteers.  52.  In the case of interns, their responsibilities, obligations and systems of sanctions  are established in the administrative instruction establishing the conditions and  procedures for the selection and engagement of interns at the United Nations,65 as well  as in the internship agreement governing their contractual relationship with the United  Nations.  53. All of these categories of other United Nations Secretariat personnel are  required to cooperate fully with OIOS or other mandated investigations.        X. Third parties (including vendors, non-State donors and  implementing partners)      54. The Secretariat recognizes that, generally, to legally bind a third party to  comply with certain obligations, such obligations need to be included in a  contractually binding document between the United Nations and that third party. In  this connection, in the case of vendors, the United Nations General Conditions of  Contract, which are to be included as part of all procurement contracts for goods  and/or services entered into by the Secretariat, contain provisions intended to deter  and address fraudulent acts. For example, the ""Observance of the Law"" clause  requires contractors to comply with all relevant laws regarding their performance of  the contract, and includes an express provision requiring contractors to maintain  compliance with all obligations relating to their registration as a qualified vendor of  goods or services to the United Nations, as set forth in the United Nations vendor  registration procedures; the ""Officials not to Benefit"" clause requires contractors to  warrant that they have not, and shall not, offer any United Nations representative,  official, employee or agent a benefit related to the contract or any other contract  with the United Nations or the award of such contracts or for any other purpose  intended to gain an advantage for the contractor; the ""Audits and Investigations""  clause includes an obligation on the part of contractors to cooperate with  investigations/audits; and the ""Responsibility for Employees"" clause includes a  requirement that contractors' personnel respect local laws and conform to a high  standard of moral and ethical conduct.  55. The United Nations awards contracts to vendors registered with the  Secretariat. Vendors seeking to register with the Secretariat must, as part of the  vendor registration process, declare that they meet certain prerequisites. In addition,  vendors are informed that non-adherence to the principles set forth in the United  Nations Supplier Code of Conduct, which, inter alia, describes the Organization's  anti-corruption policies, will be a factor in considering their eligibility to be  registered as a United Nations supplier or to do business with the United Nations.   __________________    64 ST/AI/2013/5.    65 ST/AI/2014/1.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  18/32    56. Chapter 4 of the United Nations Procurement Manual, ""Ethical Standards in  Procurement"", describes the ethical standards and responsibilities expected in  United Nations procurement and includes information regarding corrupt, fraudulent  and unethical practices (chap. 4.10).  57. Chapter 7 of the United Nations Procurement Manual, ""Vendor Registration  and Management"", describes the Vendor Review Committee, which is an internal  review body that reviews and renders advice to the Assistant Secretary-General for  Central Support Services on vendor registration status, including the suspension or  removal of vendors from the ""Register of Vendors"". Upon receipt of  recommendations from the Vendor Review Committee, the Assistant Secretary- General for Central Support Services decides on any changes to a vendor 's  registration status, including suspension or removal from the ""Register of Vendors"".  Vendors are notified of such a decision and are informed that they may request its  review.   58. In the case of non-State donors and implementing partners, the Secretariat's  departments and offices should ensure that adequate due diligence is carried out  prior to engaging in a contractual relationship with them. They are expected to use  resources efficiently and for the intended purpose, and to refrain from, prevent and  mitigate all possible fraudulent acts.   59.  Non-State donors66 and implementing partners must ensure that proper procedures  are in place to address incidents of fraudulent acts. Non-State donors and implementing  partners are also expected to disclose to the Organization any potential conflict of  interest, and also to disclose if any official or professional under contract with the  United Nations may have an interest in or a financial tie to the non-State donor  organization or implementing partner's business.   60. All agreements with implementing partners should contain appropriate  anti-fraud and corruption clauses and clauses stating that they are subject to regular  monitoring activities, verifications and external (including forensic) audits for their  use of United Nations funds and sanctions in the case of proven allegations of fraud.  61. Examples of fraudulent acts by vendors, non-State donors and implementing  partners may include: the forging of documents; making false statements to obtain a  financial or other benefit to which the entity is not entitled; offering something of  value to improperly influence a procurement process; ""collusion"" or other  anti-competitive scheme between suppliers during a tender process to obtain undue  benefits; deliberate substandard compliance with contractual terms; diversion or  misappropriation of funds; purported delivery of diverted goods; billing twice or  multiple times for the same items or services; falsifying internal records that are  used to support claims; failing to report known overpayments and credit balances by  or to the Organization, ""extortion"" or ""coercion"" (the act of attempting to influence  the process of procuring goods, services or works, or executing contracts by means  of threats of injury to person, property or reputation); and so forth.      __________________    66 The term ""non-State donors"" refers to individuals, trusts and foundations, and companies.    ST/IC/2016/25    19/32  16-15827      XI. Reporting to Member States      62. The annex to the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations  (ST/SGB/2013/4), entitled ""Additional terms of reference governing the audit of the  United Nations"", entrusts to the Board of Auditors the responsibility of reporting to  the General Assembly all cases of fraud or presumptive fraud in the context of its  reports to the intergovernmental bodies.   63. OIOS also submits annual reports to the General Assembly on its activities in  peacekeeping and regular budget areas, with references to specific investigations of  possible misconduct, including fraudulent acts.  64. In addition, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/63, on  criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission, and  subsequent resolutions on the same topic, the Secretary-General reports to the  Assembly on an annual basis the number and nature of cases involving credible  allegations of criminal conduct against United Nations officials and experts on  mission, which have been referred to the States of nationality. In accordance with  Assembly resolution 70/114, the Secretary-General's reports also include  information on the United Nations entity involved; the type of crime and summary  of allegations; and the status of any investigation, prosecutorial and/or disciplinary  action taken by national authorities.   65. Finally, cases of misconduct and/or criminal behaviour involving Secretariat  staff members, and the disciplinary consequences thereof, are made public by the  Secretariat on a yearly basis in accordance with General Assembly resolution  59/287, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that all  staff of the Organization are informed of the most common examples of misconduct  and/or criminal behaviour and their disciplinary consequences, including any legal  action, with due regard for the protection of the privacy of the staff member(s)  concerned.        ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  20/32    Annex I    Relevant sections of United Nations official documentation  related to fraudulent acts        A. The Charter of the United Nations      1.  The Charter of the United Nations is the foundational treaty of the  Organization. It establishes, inter alia, that in the performance of their duties, ""the  Secretary-General and the staff shall not seek or receive instructions from any  government or from any other authority external to the Organization"", and also  states that they shall ""refrain from any action which might reflect on their position  as international officials responsible only to the Organization"" (Article 100).  Furthermore, the Charter states that the ""paramount consideration in the  employment of the staff and in the determination of the conditions of service shall  be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and  integrity"" (Article 101).        B. Oath of office      2.  Every United Nations staff member is called upon by the Charter of the United  Nations to uphold the highest levels of efficiency, competence and integrity. This  commitment is reflected in the United Nations oath of office, which every staff  member must take when he or she begins his or her career in the Organization and  which reads as follows:  ""I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and  conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the  United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the  interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept  instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government  or other source external to the Organization.  ""I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations incumbent  upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules.""        C. Outside activities      3.  Staff regulation 1.2 (o) establishes that staff members ""shall not engage in any  outside occupation or employment, whether remunerated or not, without the  approval of the Secretary-General"". Staff rule 1.2 (s) to (v) further establishes  policies with regard to which outside activities may be performed by a staff member  and under what circumstances. Further elaboration on the internal procedures to  follow in regard to these provisions may be found in the administrative instruction  on outside activities (ST/AI/2000/13).        ST/IC/2016/25    21/32  16-15827      D. Gifts and hospitality      4.  Staff regulation 1.2 (j) and (k) establishes that staff members shall not accept  any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from any Government, except in  very limited circumstances under which a staff member may receive these on behalf  of the Organization. Staff regulation 1.2 (l) establishes that staff members shall not  accept  any  honour,  decoration,  favour,  gift  or  remuneration  from  any  non-governmental source without the prior authorization of the Secretary-General.  The administrative instruction on reporting, retaining and disposing of honours,  decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration from governmental and non-governmental  sources (ST/AI/2010/1) provides further elaboration on the processes to follow.  Different provisions apply to staff members involved in the procurement process (see  sect. 4.8 of the United Nations Procurement Manual for guidance).         E. Use of the United Nations emblem      5.  The use of the United Nations emblem and name, including any abbreviation  thereof, is reserved for the official purposes of the United Nations, in accordance  with General Assembly resolution 92 (I) of 7 December 1946. That resolution  expressly prohibits the use of the United Nations name and emblem in any other  way without the express authorization of the Secretary-General, and recommends  that Member States take the measures necessary to prevent the use of the United  Nations emblem and name without the authorization of the Secretary-General.  Article 6 ter of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (the  ""Convention""), revised in Stockholm in 1967, provides trademark protection in  respect of the emblems and names of ""international organizations"" and requires  States parties to the Convention ""to prohibit by appropriate measures the use,  without authorization by the competent authorities"", of the emblems and names of  international organizations. Pursuant to resolution 92 (I), some Member States have  promulgated legislation protecting the United Nations name and emblem, including  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of  America. If any entity other than the United Nations, its funds and programmes and  other subsidiary organs wishes to use the United Nations emblem and name, it is  required to seek prior authorization from the Office of Legal Affairs.        F. Use of property and assets      6.  Staff regulation 1.2 (q) establishes that United Nations assets and property  shall be used only for official purposes and with reasonable care. Moreover,  financial rule 106.7 (a) and (b) authorizes the Under-Secretary-General for  Management to request any staff member to reimburse the United Nations, either  partially or in full, for the loss of assets, including cash, receivables, property, plant  and equipment, inventories and intangible assets, if the staff member is responsible  for such loss.  7.  Further elaboration on the internal procedures related to property and assets of  the Organization may be found in the administrative instructions on the management  of property (ST/AI/2015/4) and on the control of United Nations property covered  by personal property receipts (ST/AI/97/Rev.2).     ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  22/32      G. Financial responsibility of staff members for gross negligence      8.  Staff rule 1.7, ""Financial responsibility"", requests staff members to ""exercise  reasonable care in any matter affecting the financial interests of the Organization, its  physical and human resources, property and assets"". In addition, staff rule 10.1 (b),  ""Misconduct"", establishes that where the staff member's failure to comply with his  or her obligations or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an  international civil servant is determined by the Secretary-General to constitute  misconduct, such staff member may be required to reimburse the Organization, in  full or in part, for any financial loss suffered as a result of the staff member's  actions, if such actions are determined to be wilful, reckless or grossly negligent.  Under financial rule 101.2, ""Responsibility and accountability"", any staff member  ""who contravenes the Financial Regulations and Rules or corresponding  administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and financially  liable for his or her actions"".        H. Relevant provisions of the United Nations General Conditions   of Contract      9.  The United Nations General Conditions of Contract, which are to be included  as part of all procurement contracts for goods and/or services entered into by the  Secretariat, contain provisions intended to deter fraud, as follows:    (a)  The ""Observance of the Law"" clause requires contractors to comply with  all relevant laws regarding their performance of the contract, and includes an  express provision requiring contractors to maintain compliance with all obligations  relating to their registration as a qualified vendor of goods or services to the United  Nations, as set forth in the United Nations vendor registration procedures;     (b)  The ""Officials not to Benefit"" clause requires contractors to warrant that  they have not, and shall not, offer any United Nations representative, official,  employee or agent a benefit related to the contract or any other contract with the  United Nations or the award of such contracts or for any other purpose intended to  gain an advantage for the contractor;     (c)  The ""Audits and Investigations"" clause includes an obligation on the part  of contractors to cooperate with investigations/audits;     (d)  The ""Responsibility for Employees"" clause includes a requirement that  contractors' personnel respect local laws and conform to a high standard of moral  and ethical conduct.        I. Post-employment restrictions      10. The  Secretary-General's  bulletin  on  post-employment  restrictions  (ST/SGB/2006/15) establishes the following restrictions on the post-employment  activities of staff members involved in procurement and the sanctions for violations  of those restrictions:    (a)  For a period of one year following separation from service, former staff  members may not seek or accept employment with, or accept any form of    ST/IC/2016/25    23/32  16-15827    compensation or financial benefit from, any vendor which conducts or seeks to  conduct business with the United Nations and with whom such staff members have  been personally involved in the procurement process during the last three years of  service with the Organization;    (b)  For a period of two years following separation from service, staff  members may not knowingly communicate with, or appear before, any staff member  or unit of the Organization on behalf of any third party on any matters that were  under their official responsibility relating to the procurement process during the last  three years of their service with the Organization;     (c)  While in service, staff members may not solicit or accept, directly or  indirectly, any promise or offer of future employment from any vendor which  conducts, or seeks to conduct, business with the Organization and with whom such  staff members have been personally involved in the procurement process during the  previous three years of service with the Organization.        J. Entities conducting investigations in the United Nations Secretariat      11.  The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established to assist the  Secretary-General in fulfilling his internal oversight responsibilities, in particular  with regard to investigation, inspection and evaluation, monitoring and internal  audit.a It is the primary office charged with investigating high-risk, complex matters  and serious criminal cases -- including complex fraud and corruption cases --  which it has classified as ""category I"" cases. In respect of cases considered to be of  lower risk to the Organization -- classified by OIOS as ""category II"" casesb -- a  number of entities in the Secretariat may conduct investigations and/or  administrative inquiries, as described below:    (a)  Heads of department/office/mission and programme managers: heads of  department or responsible officers shall undertake investigations where there is  reason to believe that a staff member has engaged in unsatisfactory conduct for  which a disciplinary measure may be imposed;c    (b)  Department of Safety and Security: the investigative capability of the  Department of Safety and Security rests within the special investigation units at, for  example, Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters and regional commissions,  which also investigate category II cases;  __________________    a See General Assembly resolution 48/218 B.    b See the report of OIOS on strengthening the investigation functions in the United Nations  (A/58/708), which describes ""category I"" and ""category II"" cases, as classified by OIOS.  ""Category II"" cases are described as being of lower risk to the Organization and include the  following: personnel matters, traffic-related inquiries, simple thefts, contract disputes, office  management disputes, basic misuse of equipment or staff, basic mismanagement issues,  infractions of regulations, rules or administrative issuances and simple entitlement fraud.  ""Category I"" cases are classified as high-risk, complex matters and serious criminal cases,  including the following: serious or complex fraud, other serious criminal act or activity, abuse of  authority or staff, conflict of interest, gross mismanagement, waste of substantial resources,  cases involving risk of loss of life to staff or to others, substantial violation of United Nations  regulations, rules or administrative issuances, and complex proactive investigations aimed at  studying and reducing risk to life and/or United Nations property.    c See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures. See also General  Assembly resolution 59/287, para. 7.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  24/32      (c)  Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field  Support:d    (i)  Panels convened by heads of mission: heads of mission can undertake  investigations where there is reason to believe that a staff member has engaged  in unsatisfactory conduct for which a disciplinary measure may be imposed;e    (ii) Special investigation units of the security sections of field missions are  mandated to investigate all category II cases -- and other, similar  allegations -- occurring in the missions or referred to missions by OIOS for  investigation. Field mission special investigation units can investigate  allegations against all personnel of a mission, but they conduct predominantly  investigations involving civilian personnel, i.e., staff members, United Nations  Volunteers, consultants, independent contractors and employees of United  Nations contractors.        K. Other review mechanism      12. In addition, the Ethics Office conducts ""preliminary reviews"" of retaliation  complaints to ascertain whether a prima facie case of retaliation exists. Such a  ""preliminary review"" is not considered to be an investigation. However, if the  Ethics Office finds a prima facie case of retaliation, it then refers the matter to  OIOS for a complete investigation.f        __________________    d This section does not include areas of the Organization that cover military and police serving in  peacekeeping operations and special political missions, such as: the United Nations military  police (force provost marshal), who usually conduct investigations of possible misconduct by  military personnel (members of contingents, staff officers and United Nations military observers)  in instances where Member States do not exercise their primary jurisdiction to conduct such  investigations or in support of Member State investigations or the United Nations police, who  may investigate breaches of conduct and allegations involving United Nations police personnel  (formed police units and individually deployed United Nations police personnel). Finally, field  mission special investigation units can investigate allegations against all personnel of a mission,  but they predominantly conduct investigations involving civilian personnel.     e See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures. See also General  Assembly resolution 59/287, para. 7.    f See ST/SGB/2005/21, on protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for  cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations.

"accountability","  United Nations    ST/SGB/2019/2      Secretariat      17 December 2018       18-21528 (E)    211218      *1821528*         Secretary-General's bulletin         Delegation of authority in the administration of the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules        The Secretary-General, for the purposes of decentralizing decision-making,  aligning authorities with responsibilities and strengthening accountability, and to  delegate to managers the necessary managerial authority over human, financial and  physical resources to allow for effective mandate delivery, promulgates the following:        Section 1      Establishment of the new framework for delegation of authority    1.1 The Secretary-General hereby rescinds all existing delegations of authority and  subdelegations of authority under the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial  Regulations and Rules issued to any official of the United Nations, other than the  executive heads of separately administered and funded subsidiary organs, institutions,  funds and programmes of the United Nations. The Secretary-General hereby  establishes the framework for the reissuance of new delegations of authority directly  to heads of entity1 to implement specified aspects of the Staff Regulations and Rules  and the Financial Regulations and Rules.   1.2 All delegations of authority, including any limitations, will be issued and  managed through an online portal, described below.   1.3 The matters reserved exclusively for the decision of the Secretary-General are  set out in the annexes to the present bulletin. Where authority over a matter is not  delegated, the matter is reserved for the decision of the Secretary-General.        Section 2      General principles of delegation (including subdelegation) of authority in the  administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial  Regulations and Rules    2.1 As the chief administrative officer of the Organization under the Charter of the  United Nations, the Secretary-General holds the primary authority and accountability  for the administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial  __________________    1  ""Head of entity"" means the head of a department or an office, including an office away from  Headquarters; the head of a special political or peacekeeping mission; the head of a regional  commission; a resident or regional coordinator; or the head of any other unit tasked with  programmed activities.  ST/SGB/2019/2      18-21528  2/23    Regulations and Rules. The Secretary-General's authority may be delegated in  accordance with the principles and procedures set out in the present bulletin.  2.2 The annexes to the present bulletin set out the standard authorities that a head  of entity may receive, depending on the capacity of the entity to receive and  implement the delegations in a responsible and effective manner. The capacity of any  entity may change over time, and the assessment of that capacity and the appropriate  level of specific delegations of authority shall be the responsibility of the Under- Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation  with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support and the head of entity  concerned.  2.3 A core principle of delegation of authority is the delegation of centrally held  decision-making closer to the point of service delivery. The exercise of a delegated  authority is the taking of a decision within the authority delegated and is separate  from the execution of that decision, which may require a specific administrative  capacity. Delegation of authority should not lead to the creation of new duplicative  administrative capacities in entities which lack the structural capacity to execute  decisions. Consequently, where the head of entity has the capacity to take a decision  under delegated authority but the entity lacks the appropriate capacity to execute the  decision, another entity will be assigned by the Under-Secretary-General for  Operational Support, in consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the head of entity concerned, to  execute the decision on the entity's behalf as a service provider.  2.4 Where the Secretary-General has delegated the authority to administer the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules to heads of entity,  such delegation shall be understood to be on a functional, rather than personal, basis  unless the Secretary-General has expressly indicated otherwise.   2.5 All delegations of authority shall be made formally through the dedicated online  portal.2   The authorities delegated shall be clearly stated and accepted by both the  delegator and the delegatee, including that such delegation may be suspended,  amended or revoked as provided in section 4.4 below. The delegation should include  the description of the authority being delegated and any specific limitations imposed,  including but not limited to restrictions on further subdelegation and essential  segregations of duties where applicable. Delegatees shall inform themselves of the  delegation and the relevant regulations, rules, policies, practices and standards  applicable to any decision or action to be taken under the authority delegated and  cannot claim ignorance of such in defence of any decision or action taken in the  exercise of any delegated authority. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support shall be available to  support delegatees in this regard.   2.6 When an officer-in-charge or an officer ad interim is assigned to a function, the  authorities of the official holding that function shall automatically be delegated on a  temporary basis to the officer-in-charge or the officer ad interim, unless otherwise  specified formally by the official who designated the officer-in-charge or the officer  ad interim.  2.7 A delegation of authority by the Secretary-General to a head of entity entails  personal responsibility for duly discharging the authority and personal accountability  for incorrectly applying or failing to correctly discharge the authority. On the advice  of the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance in  __________________    2  Where circumstances require delegation to be made outside the online portal, such delegation  shall be made in writing, with a copy provided to the Under-Secretary-General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance.    ST/SGB/2019/2    3/23  18-21528    consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support, the  Secretary-General has the discretion at any time to enquire about and to provide input  on the exercise of delegated authorities and to suspend, amend or withdraw the  delegated authorities, and any such resulting action shall be reflected in the online  portal.  2.8 Within an entity, delegated authority may be further delegated, unless such  further delegation has been excluded by the delegator in the delegation or  subdelegation. Delegators remain accountable and responsible for the exercise of  delegated authority that they subdelegate. Any such subdelegation should be along  reporting lines and on a functional and not a personal basis and therefore be consistent  with the anticipated responsibilities to be performed. The original delegator has the  discretion at any time to enquire about and to provide input on the exercise of  delegated authorities and to suspend, amend or withdraw the delegated authorities,  and any such resulting action shall also be reflected in the online portal.  2.9 A delegatee shall promptly and fully comply with all reporting requirements set  by the delegator and the Under-Secretaries-General for Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance and for Operational Support.   2.10 Any staff member to whom authority is delegated or subdelegated, as the case  may be, in accordance with the present bulletin is accountable for exercising the  highest standards of professionalism and integrity in accordance with the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the standards of conduct for the international civil service.  The exercise of such authority shall be based on considered professional judgment,  in full conformity with the Staff Regulations and Rules, the Financial Regulation and  Rules, policies, practices and standards and overall interests of the Organization and  subject to the United Nations Secretariat accountability system. 3   2.11 For the purposes of the present bulletin, ""accountability"" is the obligation of  staff members to be answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and  to be responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or  exception. Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a  timely and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all  mandates to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental bodies  and other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all resolutions,  regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective, accurate and timely  reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship of funds and resources; all  aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of rewards and sanctions;  and with due recognition to the important role of the oversight bodies and in full  compliance with accepted recommendations.        Section 3      Delegations of authority to be held centrally    3.1 The Secretary-General shall delegate certain authorities to be held and exercised  centrally by the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance or the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support for reasons  including oversight and assurance, coordination of inter-entity operational support  matters, and administration of human resources and physical assets shared between  Secretariat entities. In addition, the Under-Secretaries-General for Operational  Support and for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance may, in consultation  with each other, apply temporary exceptional measures for application in  extraordinary situations.  __________________    3  See A/64/640 and A/72/773.  ST/SGB/2019/2      18-21528  4/23    3.2 The authorities to be centrally held and exercised are set out in the annexes to  the present bulletin.         Section 4      Management of authorities delegated to heads of entity    4.1 Heads of entity will receive notification of their delegations of authority from  the Secretary-General and any actions relating to such delegations, such as  amendment, suspension or revocation, through the online portal. The heads of entity  will acknowledge receipt of the delegations to them in their capacity as head of entity  through the portal.   4.2 Through the online portal, the heads of entity will be provided with a description  of the authority being delegated and any specific limitations imposed, including but  not limited to restrictions on further subdelegation and essential segregations of duties  where applicable. Heads of entity will use the online portal to subdelegate authority  and shall be able to view all subdelegations within their entity.   4.3 The authorities delegated to heads of entity are specific to that function and are  not personal in nature. When heads of entity cease to hold the appointment for that  function, they will no longer hold or be able to exercise the authorities delegated to  that function. Pending the appointment of an officer-in-charge, an officer ad interim  or a replacement head of entity, all subdelegations will remain in effect. When the  head of entity is succeeded by another, the duly appointed successor will ordinarily  be afforded the same level of delegations as the predecessor and shall be notified of  and accept the delegations through the online portal. All subdelegations issued by the  predecessor shall remain valid, with the accountability transferring to the successor  unless otherwise withdrawn or modified by the successor.  4.4 The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance is responsible  for monitoring and evaluating compliance with the present bulletin, including  whether any circumstances have arisen that justify the suspension, amendment or  revocation of any delegation, in whole or in part; this may also result in the imposition  of administrative or disciplinary measures. Delegations of authority granted to a head  of entity may be suspended, amended or revoked at any time by the Secretary-General  on the advice of the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance in consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational  Support. The decision to suspend, amend or revoke (in whole or in part) the  authorities delegated to the heads of entity, including the reasons therefor, shall be  recorded through the online portal. A record of the decision and the reasons for such  action shall be maintained by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance.   4.5 In the event that certain delegated authorities of the head of entity are  suspended, amended or revoked or otherwise revised pursuant to section 4.4, the  Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in  consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support, shall make a  recommendation to the Secretary-General on which head of entity should exercise  those authorities until such time as the circumstances giving rise to the suspension,  amendment or revocation of the authorities no longer apply. Where appropriate, the  Department of Operational Support shall work with the entity concerned to enhance  its capability until the required capacity has been developed to the satisfaction of the  Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   4.6 The Under-Secretaries-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and for Operational Support shall be able to view all delegations and  subdelegations of authority made through the online portal.      ST/SGB/2019/2    5/23  18-21528        Section 5      Management of subdelegations of authority by the heads of entity    5.1 Within entities, the heads of entity shall subdelegate selected authorities vested  in them, in accordance with any limitation set out in the individual delegation of  authority, to their staff, aligning authorities with responsibilities while ensuring key  segregation of duties, to ensure the most effective and responsible use of the resources  under their authority to deliver their mandates. They should decide on the scope and  limit of the authorities to be delegated and the effective date of delegation. The further  delegation of authorities from the head of entity shall be made through the online  portal.  5.2 In circumstances where it is determined by the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation with the head of entity concerned,  that the mandate of that entity requires the subdelegation of specific authorities to the  head of another entity, such subdelegation shall be made through the online portal.   5.3 Authorities subdelegated by the head of entity may be suspended, amended or  revoked, in whole or in part, by the head of entity at any time when circumstances  have arisen that justify such action. The head of entity shall do so through the online  portal and shall communicate the reasons for such action in writing to the delegatee.  A record of the decision and reasons for such action shall be maintained by the head  of the human resources unit of the entity concerned.  5.4 Should there be any changes to the authorities delegated to the head of entity,  whether for policy reasons or to reflect a change in circumstances, the head of entity  shall ensure that concomitant changes are made to any subdelegations to align those  subdelegations with the revised authority vested in the head of entity. Such changes  shall be made through the online portal.         Section 6      Monitoring the exercise of delegated authority      The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will monitor  the use of delegated authority, including through the use of key performance  indicators, to ensure that the delegatees are complying with the applicable legal and  policy framework and internal controls.

Introduction    The United Nations faces a considerable level of risk owing to the complexities of its  operations and increased scope of its mandates.  Risk management is therefore an area already  considered at various levels, and embedded in different processes and operations of the United  Nations Secretariat.  Capital Master Plan1, Information and Communication Technology2,  Security3, Organizational Resilience4, among other areas, have already successfully adopted and  implemented risk management methodologies and practices.    The General Assembly fully recognized the importance of the implementation of a  systematic approach to risk management and internal control in the United Nations, and provided  a clear mandate to the Secretary-General to enhance ""the current capabilities in the Secretariat  responsible for risk assessment and mitigation and internal control on the basis of [...] annex II  to the report of the Secretary-General [A/64/640]""5.    Following the mandates of the General Assembly, and fully in line with the benchmarks  on enterprise risk management implementation recommended by the Joint Inspection Unit  (""JIU"")6, this Policy further expands and strengthens the approach to risk management already  embraced by different areas of the Organization, adopting an integrated Enterprise Risk  Management and Internal Control Framework (""the framework"") that provides a consistent and  comprehensive risk management methodology that can be applied across the entire Secretariat.    Given the operational nature of the work of the Organization and the resultant broad  array of its activities, the framework allows for a strong operational component, and outlines a  flexible structure which can be easily adhered to across the spectrum of activities and work  environments, without resulting in additional administrative overhead for staff members.    The Secretary-General strongly believes enterprise risk management is the inherent core  responsibility of management.  With the adoption of an enterprise risk management and internal  control process as a strategic initiative, the Secretariat defines a consistent methodology for  assessing, treating, monitoring and communicating risks.  The framework is designed to address  both the strategic risks associated with the execution of the mandates and objectives as defined  by the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the risks inherent in the daily operations that  support the achievement of those mandates, defining a flexible methodology that is fully  compatible with the different risk management practices already adopted by the Organization,                                                    1 ""Capital Master Plan Risk Management Framework"", April 2008.  2 Adoption of ISO 27001, ISO 27002 and Octave Risk Assessment Methodology by the Information and  Communications Technology Board of the Secretariat, April 2008.  3 ""Policies and Guidelines on Security Risk Management and Minimum Operating Security Standards"", April  2009.  4 ""Organizational Resilience Policy for the United Nations Headquarters, New York"", June 2010.  5 Resolution A/RES/63/276 of 26 June 2009 and Resolution A/RES/64/259 of 5 May 2010.  6 ""Review of enterprise risk management in the United Nations system: Benchmarking framework"",  JIU/REP/2010/4, Joint Inspection Unit, 2010.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 4 of 15  May 2011  e.g. with regard to security risks.  Properly implemented, it provides insight into potential risks as  well as new opportunities, and shall become a key part of the strategy and planning processes.      II.  Definition    Consistent with the best international standards7 enterprise risk management is defined  as the process of coordinated activities designed to direct and control an organization with regard  to risk, the effect of uncertainty on objectives.  It is applied in strategy-setting throughout the  Organization.    An effective system of internal control is encompassed within and an integral part of  enterprise risk management.  As defined by the best international standards, enterprise risk  management is broader than internal control, expanding and elaborating on internal control to  form a more robust conceptualisation and tool for management.      III.  Purpose    The Secretary-General is convinced that the implementation of this framework will  introduce significant enhancements in the governance and management practices of the  Organization, some of which are outlined below.    (i)  Focus on Objectives - Increased effectiveness in the achievement of the  defined objectives and mandates through a consistent identification, assessment,  and management of risks among Secretariat entities, and the systematic  measurement of risk and performance.  (ii)  Internal Controls - Embedded risk and internal control management activities,  enabling risk management to become an integral part of the processes and  operations of the entire Organization, and determining the type of risk mitigation  or corrective measures necessary to manage the identified risks.  (iii)  Efficient Use of Resources - Improved performance against objectives,  contributing to reduced waste and fraud, better value for money, and a  significantly more efficient use of available resources.  (iv)  Accountability - Enhanced accountability and performance management  through the definition of clear risk management roles and responsibilities.  (v)  Results Based Management - Promotion of a risk driven culture through a  more informed risk based decision-making capability, as the significance of risks  and the effectiveness of designed controls are explicitly considered when  evaluating programmes and relevant budget allocations, according to an  effective results based management approach.  (vi)  Transparency - Improved transparency within the Organization and towards  member states, as risks are clearly communicated internally and externally                                                    7 ""Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework"" and ""Thought Papers on Enterprise Risk  Management"", Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, 2004, 2009, 2010 and  2011;  ""Guidelines for Internal Control Standards for the Public Sector"", Internal Control Standards Committee of  the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, 2004 and 2007; and  ""Risk management - Principles and Guidelines"" - International Organization for Standardization, 2009.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 5 of 15  May 2011  through periodic formal reporting by management to the Independent Audit  Advisory Committee (""IAAC"") and the General Assembly.  (vii)  Assurance - Improved assurance over internal controls through the formal  recognition of management's responsibility for effective controls, and the  appropriate management of risks.  (viii)  Oversight - The ability to enhance governance and oversight functions.  (ix)  Governance - An increased capability of senior management to make informed  decisions regarding risk/reward tradeoffs related to existing and new  programmes, through the adoption of a structured approach for the identification  of opportunities to enhance the allocation of resources throughout the  Organization, and reduce related costs.      IV.  Principles    The enterprise risk management and internal control programme is guided by the  following core principles:    (i)  Embedding - Risk management must be explicitly embedded in existing  processes.  Appropriate flexibility needs to be applied in the execution of  strategies and allocation of relevant resources through the proper consideration  of the risks that could affect the achievement of the objectives applicable to each  project, organizational unit, and the Secretariat at entity level.  (ii)  Consistency - The Organization shall adopt, as part of its decision-making  process, a consistent method for the identification, assessment, treatment,  monitoring and communication of risks associated with any of its processes and  functions, in an effort to efficiently and effectively achieve its objectives.  (iii)  Integration - The enterprise risk management and internal control framework  must be fully integrated with the major operational processes, as strategic  planning, operational and financial management.  Risk management shall be in  particular integrated with the adoption of an effective results based management  approach. Enterprise risk management complements results based management  by enabling to effectively achieve set objectives with a clear, shared  understanding of the internal and external uncertainties that may impact  activities.  High priority risks and the effectiveness of related controls shall be  also fully considered in the evaluation of programmes and relevant budget  allocations.    The effective implementation of the framework within the Secretariat shall rely as well  on:    (iv)  Management Ownership  - Risk owners and management across the  Organization must have a sound understanding of the risks impacting their  operations, and the level of flexibility provided to appropriately determine the  available and appropriate course of action to manage those risks, increasing  accountability.  (v)  Risk Aware Culture - A risk-focused and results-oriented culture shall be  nurtured, moving the Organization from the current predominantly risk averse  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 6 of 15  May 2011  culture, where the focus is merely on risk avoidance, to a risk aware culture,  where decisions are driven by a systematic assessment of risks and rewards.   The dissemination of information and best practices with regard to risk and  internal control management principles shall be supported across the  Organization, developing appropriate communication and training programs.  (vi)  Communication - Adequate information shall be provided to senior  management, the Management Committee, the Secretary-General and the  General Assembly.  The governing body, with the advice of the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (""ACABQ"") and the IAAC,  as may be relevant, will be then in a position to effectively fulfil its  responsibilities of determining the risk tolerance of the Organization.    Commitments    The strong support and commitment of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General and  senior management are essential for the establishment of effective risk and internal control  management processes.  A sustainable framework shall therefore be based on:    (i)  Support - The endorsement and consistent support from senior management,  confirmed by visible actions, is critical for the successful implementation of the  framework.  (ii)  Accountability - The adoption of an effective framework relies on the full  ownership and accountability of management at each level throughout the  Organization for risk management and internal control activities.  (iii)  Resources - Risk and internal control management shall be supported by  experienced resources, at Department, Office, Commission, Mission and Tribunal  level, as well as at entity level.    United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 7 of 15  May 2011  V.  Process    Enterprise risk m anagement, as defined before, is a process owned and executed by  management.  The main components of the risk management process are illustrated in Figure 1  below, and further described in this section of the document.  The definition of all the relevant  technical terms is included in the Annex of this Policy - Glossary of Terms and Definitions.    Figure 1 - Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control Process    In particular:    (1)  Establishing the Context - Establishing the context encompasses the  definition of the Organization's overall risk management approach, as outlined by  a dedicated policy articulating the purpose, governance mechanisms, and  principles that guide the adoption of the framework.  (2)  Consideration of Risks and Objectives - Risks shall be mapped and aligned  to objectives, mandates and strategic initiatives at both the UN Secretariat and  functional level (Departments, Offices, Commissions, Missions and Tribunals) in  order to measure and prioritise the risk exposure.  Specific measurement criteria  for risk evaluation shall be as well defined.  (3)  Event Identification and Risk Assessment - Risks are assessed in the  context of the objectives, mandates and strategic plans through risk  questionnaires, interviews, workshops with relevant management and staff,  analysis of historical data, and other sources.  Identified risks shall then be  measured and scored according to the weighting of perceived impact, likelihood  and level of internal control effectiveness.  Once the assessment is completed,  the ability to appropriately link risks to both organizational strategies and  objectives, and the underlying processes and activities, is critical to the  identification and implementation of effective risk mitigation measures.

According to best practices,  residual risk is the risk remaining after management has taken action to alter the  risk's likelihood or impact, and shall therefore be the starting point for  determining the appropriate treatment response.  An effective system of internal  control is an integral part of enterprise risk management.  (5)  Information and Communication - Ongoing reporting on results of risk  assessments, including risk treatment plans and actions, shall be established,  supported by adequate information systems. Appropriate communication and  training programs shall be developed across the Organization to nurture the  development of a sound risk aware culture and build adequate capacity and  critical skills.  (6)  Monitoring and Assurance - Ongoing monitoring of risks and internal controls  shall be as well implemented.    A detailed description of the specific steps to be followed in the definition of an effective  enterprise risk management and internal control framework, and of the necessary tools, is  provided in the Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control Methodology paper, that  complements this Policy.      VI.  Risk Governance Structure, Roles and Responsibilities    Proper risk governance mechanisms are critical for the adoption of an effective risk  management framework.  This section provides a description of the roles and responsibilities of  the different functions involved, followed by an illustration of the risk management and internal  control governance structure (Figure 2).    General Assembly    The General Assembly, with the advice of the ACABQ and IAAC, is responsible for  determining the risk tolerance of the Organization9.    Secretary-General    Ultimate responsibility for effective risk and internal control management within the  Secretariat resides with the Secretary-General.  The Secretary-General annually reviews with the  Management Committee the significant risks faced by the Organization, and the proposed  strategies designed to effectively mitigate the identified risks at a consolidated entity level, and  accordingly reports to the General Assembly and the IAAC.                                                    8 ""Activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services for the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011"",  A/66/286, 9 August 2011.  9 ""Resolution adopted by the General Assembly - Progress towards an accountability system in the United  Nations Secretariat"", A/RES/66/257, 12 April 2012.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 9 of 15  May 2011  Management Committee    The Management Committee, acting as Enterprise Risk Management Committee for the  Secretariat, annually reviews the results of the risk assessments at entity level, and has an active  role in the promotion of the best practices in risk and internal control management in the  Organization, involving other Committees, as may be appropriate.  The Management Committee  shall as well monitor the effectiveness of the enterprise risk management and internal control  framework and recommend any changes that may be required.    Under-Secretaries-General (or equivalent positions)    At the level of each Department, Office, Commission, Mission, or Tribunal, responsibility  for the effective implementation risk management and internal control practices, as described by  this framework, resides with the respective Head of Department, Office, Commission, Mission, or  Tribunal.    As part of the existing senior management compacts with the Secretary-General, each  Under-Secretary-General (or equivalent position) shall annually confirm through a Certification  Report their responsibilities for the proper application of the principles and requirements of this  framework, and the establishment and maintenance of a strong internal control environment as a  result of the risk assessment process.    Local Risk and Internal Control Focal Points    The responsibilities of local Risk and Internal Control Focal Points include the provision of  assistance to local management in the implementation of the risk management requirements  described by this framework, in particular the identification of relevant risks, objectives and  mandates at the Department, Office, Commission, Mission or Tribunal level; the completion of  the risk assessment and reporting on its results; the proposal of the activities that should be  included in the Risk Treatment and Response Plan; and the provision of monitoring and reporting  to senior management on risk management and internal control measures within their area of  responsibility.    In addition, local Risk and Internal Control Focal Points shall customise the Secretariat- wide Risk Universe so that reflects the risks relevant to the Department, Office, Commission,  Mission or Tribunal; prepare reports on all risk management matters, and distribute them to the  Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function, and the responsible Under-Secretary- General, or equivalent position; and monitor the effectiveness of risk management and internal  control measures.    Risk Owners    Risk owners are responsible, amongst other matters, for:    (i)  Regularly reviewing the risks owned by them, informing the local Risk Focal Point  of any identified changes, and escalating the risks for which the relevant impact  or likelihood is perceived having increased.  (ii)  Determining where internal control deficiencies relating to their risks may be  identified, proposing any appropriate risk mitigation measures, and monitoring  risk treatments implementation relating to the risks for which they have  responsibility.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 10 of 15  May 2011  (iii)  Updating relevant risk information and contributing to risk reporting as may be  required.    Risk Treatment Owners    The design and implementation of risk treatment and response plans identified during  the risk assessment process is the responsibility of risk treatment owners.  Their responsibilities  involve implementing the risk treatments for which they are responsible, and reviewing their  effectiveness.    Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function    Enterprise risk management is the inherent core responsibility of management.  Under  the framework, embedded risk and internal control management activities are an integral part of  the processes and operations of the entire Organization.    As recommended by benchmark 4 of the JIU review of enterprise risk management in the  United Nations system10, an Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function shall  assist senior management in the process of establishment of the described framework, and  provide the appropriate level of implementation and execution oversight.    The Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function, that for the short term  shall be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management, shall move  towards a future state design stage of separate management function led by a senior  management official reporting to the highest level of the Organization and the Management  Committee, once the function is supported by adequate resources.    Without establishing a new high-level full-time responsible official for risk in the  Organization, a senior management official, acting in this capacity, shall coordinate all the  activities of the Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control function.  He or she will act  independently and objectively in the execution of his/her duties and responsibilities, fully in line  with the JIU recommended benchmarks 11.    The main responsibilities of the Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control  function shall involve, amongst other matters:    (i)  Promoting the application of sound risk management and internal control  policies, and providing oversight for the implementation of related activities  within the UN Secretariat, defining an overall vision and direction for enterprise  risk management and internal control measures.  (ii)  Defining a comprehensive enterprise risk management and internal control  framework across the Organization to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks  and internal controls, supporting the Secretary-General and management in their  efforts to embed and sustain risk management activities in the daily operations  of the Secretariat.                                                    10 Paragraph 84 and 88, ""Review of enterprise risk management in the United Nations system:  Benchmarking framework"", JIU/REP/2010/4, Joint Inspection Unit, 2010.  11 Paragraph 91 and 94, JIU/REP/2010/4.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 11 of 15  May 2011  (iii)  Maintaining the Risk Register, and facilitating the performance of the risk  assessment through assistance in interviews, development and review of  questionnaires, and facilitation of workshops, as may be needed.   (iv)  Providing the necessary expertise and resources to support the different steps in  the risk management process, including assistance and advisory in the design,  assessment, and monitoring of appropriate risk mitigation activities.  (v)  Developing and maintaining the methodology and practices related to the  implementation of risk and internal control management activities, including the  administration of the tools, training, reporting and other related requirements,  and supporting the local Risk and Internal Control Focal Points in conducting  appropriate risk and control monitoring activities.  (vi)  Preparing reports on risk management and internal control activities, including a  consolidated entity level risk assessment report for the UN Secretariat, for  distribution to the Management Committee, Secretary-General, and on behalf of  the Secretary-General to the General Assembly and the IAAC, as may be  required.  (vii)  Assisting in the provision of monitoring and oversight of risk management and  internal control activities at the Department, Office, Commission, Mission and  Tribunal level, and advising as appropriate on the development of adequate Risk  Treatment and Response Plans.  (viii)  Implementing and maintaining the necessary systems and data management  capabilities to properly support the risk management and internal control  programme.  (ix)  Supporting the dissemination of information and best practices with regard to  risk and internal control management principles and measures across the  Organization, and developing as appropriate communication and training  programs, to enhance the Secretariat's risk management culture.  (x)  Assessing the risk of not implementing non-accepted recommendations and  advising the Management Committee on possible courses of action.    Staff Members    The management of risks and internal controls in accordance with the principles as  defined by this framework is the responsibility of all the UN managers and staff members.  All  staff members, in accordance with their specific role and function, must embed risk management  in operational decision making, identifying, managing and monitoring risks with regard to day-to- day operations within their respective areas of responsibility.    Office of Internal Oversight Services    In accordance with its mandate, the Office of Internal Oversight Services shall continue  to be responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the internal control environment, including  the periodic assessment and evaluation of the implementation of an effective enterprise risk  management and internal control framework.    The Office of Internal Oversight Services is as well responsible for the review of the  results of the risk assessments process, and shall consider its outcomes into its audit planning  exercise, as deemed appropriate.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 12 of 15  May 2011  Joint Inspection Unit    The Joint Inspection Unit, as the oversight body of the United Nations system mandated  to conduct system-wide evaluations, shall identify enterprise risk management and internal  control best practices, propose benchmarks, and facilitate information-sharing throughout the  system.    Board of Auditors    The Board of Auditors, as part of its assurance activities on the financial reporting of the  Organization, is expected to utilise the results of the risk assessment as an important element of  its evaluation of the Organization's system of internal controls, as described by its mandate 12.

Conclusions    This Policy defines the enterprise risk management and internal control programme that  is formally implemented within the United Nations Secretariat to allow the Organization to  improve its accounta bility and decision making process.  The adoption of this Policy and the  maintenance of an enterprise risk management and internal control process shall provide  reasonable assurance as to the Organization's ability to effectively achieve its mandates and  objectives.    The Policy, as complemented by the Methodology describing the activities to be  performed for the effective implementation of the enterprise risk management and internal  control framework, shall be individually applied to each Department, Office, Commission, Mission,  or Tribunal according to the level and context of risk and risk assessment, and shall be reviewed  for effectiveness on an ongoing basis.  It is the responsibility of management to comply with this  Policy and related procedures.    It shall be noted that the full implementation of this Policy and of the Methodology will  require the establishment of a centralized dedicated capacity for Enterprise Risk Management and  Internal Control within the Secretariat, supported by an adequate level of resources, as  recommended by the JIU review of enterprise risk management in the United Nations system13.                                                      13 JIU/REP/2010/4.  United Nations  Enterprise Risk Management  and Internal Control Policy  Page 14 of 15  May 2011  Annex    Glossary of Terms and Definitions 14      Term  Definition    Enterprise Risk Management    The process of coordinated activities designed to direct and  control an organization with regard to risk, the effect of  uncertainty on objectives.  It is applied in strategy-setting  throughout the Organization.      Internal control is encompassed within and an integral part  of enterprise risk management.    Inherent Risk  The risk to an entity in the absence of any actions  management might take to alter either the risk's likelihood or  impact.    Internal Control  A process, effected by governing bodies, management and  other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the achievement of objectives in the following  categories:  (i)  Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;  (ii)  Reliability of financial reporting;  (iii)  Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.    Impact  Result or effect of an event.  There may be a range of  possible impacts associated with an event.  The impact of an  event can be positive or negative relative to the entity's  related objectives.    Likelihood  The possibility that a given event will occur.     Reasonable assurance  The concept that enterprise risk management, even if well  designed and operated, can not provide a guarantee  regarding the achievement of an entity's objectives, due to  the limitations of the human judgement; resource constraints  and the need to consider the cost of controls in relation to  expected benefits; and the possibility of management  override and collusion.    Residual Risk  The remaining risk after management has taken action to  alter the risk's likelihood or impact.                                                      14 Consistent with the best international standards, as ""Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated  Framework"" and ""Thought Papers on Enterprise Risk Management "", Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission, 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2011;  ""Guidelines for Internal Control Standards for the Public Sector"", Internal Control Standards Committee of  the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, 2004 and 2007; and  ""Risk management - Principles and Guidelines"" - International Organization for Standardization, 2009.

"accountability","  United Nations    ST/AI/2021/3      Secretariat      6 August 2021    21-11077 (E)    160821      *2111077*         Administrative instruction         Evaluation in the United Nations Secretariat        The  Under-Secretary-General  for  Management  Strategy,  Policy  and  Compliance, pursuant to section 4.2 of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2009/4  and for the purpose of prescribing instructions and procedures for the implementation  of article VII, Evaluation, of the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme  Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation  and the Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2018/3) promulgates the following:          Section 1     Purpose and scope       1.1 The present instruction describes the Organization's requirements and  procedures for the management, conduct and use of evaluations and sets out the  operational guidelines for article VII, Evaluation, of the Regulations and Rules  Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the  Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation. It puts into effect the  Secretary-General's intention to strengthen the evaluation capacity of the Secretariat  so as to better inform programme planning and reporting on programme performance,  among other proposals contained in his report on shifting the management paradigm  in the United Nations (A/72/492), which the General Assembly took note of in its  resolution 72/266 A.  1.2 In view of the mandates of the Inspection and Evaluation Division of the Office  of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), as set forth in Secretary-General's bulletins  ST/SGB/273 and ST/SGB/2002/7, and its role as the central evaluation unit referred  to in ST/SGB/2018/3, the present instruction clarifies the architecture of the  evaluation function in the Secretariat. It also outlines the governance arrangements  and accountabilities, as well as performance standards, for evaluation functions in the  Secretariat.   1.3 Evaluation is a shared function across Secretariat entities. The Secretariat  entities are the departments and offices, including offices away from Headquarters,  special political and peacekeeping missions, regional commissions, resident or  regional coordinators' offices and any other unit tasked with programmed activities.  1.4 The Secretary-General's report (A/72/492) and related resolutions and reports  refer to evaluation undertaken by both oversight bodies and entities and to self- evaluation as referenced and defined in section VII of ST/SGB/2018/3. The term  ST/AI/2021/3      21-11077  2/6    ""evaluation"" is used in the present instruction in reference to both. The provisions of  the instruction apply to all Secretariat entities. Accordingly, all entities are required  to have an evaluation policy that is consistent with the present instruction.  Forthcoming guidance will address transitional measures.         Section 2     Evaluation procedures          Evaluation planning and coverage norms    2.1 Each entity must develop an annual evaluation plan and ensure adequate  allocation of funds for evaluation capacity to deliver the plan. The results of  evaluations and lessons learned must be considered in the preparation of plans and  budgets for future cycles and reported in the budget documents.   2.2 Secretariat entities undertake various types of evaluation, including programme,  thematic and cross-cutting evaluations. The types of evaluation activity undertaken  by each entity depends on its role, mandate and evaluation capacity. The Regulations  and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget,  the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation note the need for  all programmes and subprogrammes to be evaluated on a regular, periodic basis,  irrespective of the source of funding.  2.3 The Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS, as the central evaluation unit,  conducts its programme and subprogramme evaluations at least once every eight  years, as specified in the table below. Specifically, the types of evaluation and  evaluative activities and their coverage norms are as follows:    (a)  Programme evaluations assess the overall relevance, effectiveness, impact  and efficiency of a single Secretariat programme or subprogramme or of a  peacekeeping operation or special political mission. As endorsed by the General  Assembly,1   each Secretariat programme is normally evaluated at least once every  eight years;    (b)  Thematic evaluations assess high-risk cross-cutting themes or activities  across multiple Secretariat entities, or the cumulative effects of multiple programmes  sharing common objectives and purposes, or the effectiveness of coordination and  cooperation among different entities. There is normally at least one thematic  evaluation on a cross-cutting theme among the priority areas of work of the  Organization each biennium;    (c)  Inspections are short, focused and targeted reviews of an organizational  unit, issue or practice perceived to be of high risk, in order to determine the extent to  which it adheres to established norms, good practices or other pre-determined criteria,  and to identify corrective action as needed. These are ad hoc and conducted as and  when identified through regular risk assessments;     (d)  Reports on strengthening the role of evaluation and the application of  evaluation findings on programme design, delivery and policy directives together  with the evaluation dashboard are the main products through which the Inspection  and Evaluation Division seeks to strengthen evaluation capacity within the  Secretariat. The reports are produced biennially (ST/SGB/2018/3, regulation 7.4);   __________________    1  In its resolution 65/244 the General Assembly endorsed the recommendation of the Committee  for Programme and Coordination at its fiftieth session (A/65/16) to approve the proposal of  OIOS for a cycle of eight years to cover all Secretariat programmes so as to improve the  programme evaluation cycle (A/65/6 (Prog. 25), para. 25.6).    ST/AI/2021/3    3/6  21-11077      (e)  Triennial reviews are assessments undertaken three years after a General  Assembly mandated inspection or evaluation to review the status of implementation  of report recommendations. All such mandated inspections and evaluations are  subject to triennial reviews (A/37/38, para. 362).   2.4 All entities are subject to the requirement that all programmed activities shall  be evaluated by the entity itself, by OIOS or by an external entity such as the Joint  Inspection Unit and other external bodies as approved by the General Assembly, as  specified in regulations 7.2 and 7.3 of the Rules and Regulations. Evaluation coverage  norms and criteria for consideration in establishing the periodicity of evaluations are  outlined in the table below. As such, Secretariat entities shall establish clearly, within  their respective evaluation policies, the specific regular periodic basis within which  all programmes and subprogrammes under their responsibility are evaluated. OIOS  and the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance shall provide  guidance on evaluation planning to ensure coordination and adequate evaluation  coverage of the Secretariat.

The norms and standards for evaluation of the United Nations  Evaluation Group provide additional non-binding advice on the conduct and  management of evaluations.   2.6 Evaluations shall follow key minimum parameters to ensure useful and credible  results:  ST/AI/2021/3      21-11077  4/6      (a)  Management arrangements for each evaluation shall ensure impartiality  and independence. The designated evaluation manager and team members shall not  be part of the team that designs or manages the implementation of the assessed policy,  plan or programme;    (b)  Entities shall develop an inception report or terms of reference that will  contain an evaluation objective, evaluation questions and evaluation design and  methods;    (c)  Evaluation results, lessons learned and recommendations shall be  incorporated and reflected in planning and budget documents so as to inform strategic  and transparent programme delivery (as specified in ST/SGB/2018/3, rule 107.4).        Quality assurance    2.7 The Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS, in consultation with the  Business Transformation and Accountability Division of the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, develops and provides guidance and  tools to support the conduct of evaluations.   2.8 Heads of entities are responsible for the existence of an appropriate quality  assurance system in their respective entities. The quality assurance system shall  include a clear process, with specific and transparent standards, for assessing the  overall quality of evaluation using agreed professional standards for the conduct of  evaluation. OIOS and the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance will provide guidance on minimum quality standards. When Secretariat  entities need assistance in conducting quality assurance at key points in the conduct  of an evaluation, they may request such assistance from the Inspection and Evaluation  Division of OIOS. Key points include identifying evaluation resources such as  consultants; preparing terms of reference, including developing potential  methodology; during the inception phase when finalizing the evaluation design; at the  time of the draft inception report; and at the time of the draft evaluation report.           Section 3     Use of evaluation data, findings and follow-up      3.1 Heads of entities shall promote the use of evaluation data, findings and follow- up through an interactive process that involves programme managers in the entity  being evaluated, end users and other relevant officials. Heads of entities shall also  ensure that recommendations, findings and lessons learned are considered in planning  and in the preparation of budgets for future cycles and are integrated into policies and  programmes.         Management response to evaluation recommendations    3.2 Management in all entities is required to prepare a response to each evaluation.  Management responses to recommendations shall be discussed with programme  managers and include specific, time-bound actions. In instances where Management  decides to adopt recommendations made pursuant to an evaluation, it shall do so by  clearly assigning responsibilities to units that will implement the recommendations.  Management responses shall be made public, except for circumstances in which such  response would divulge confidential information.         ST/AI/2021/3    5/6  21-11077       Section 4     Complementarity with other learning and oversight functions      4.1  The Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS and the evaluation units of  Secretariat entities rely on data and information from other functions such as programme  and performance monitoring, research and audit. While maintaining independence, the  Division and Secretariat evaluation units coordinate with internal and external oversight  bodies such as the Internal Audit Division of OIOS, the Board of Auditors and the Joint  Inspection Unit to ensure that evaluations can take advantage of efficiencies in the  generation and use of data and evidence for assessing organizational effectiveness.   4.2 Secretariat entities may request the Inspection and Evaluation Division of OIOS  and the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance to support the  utilization of relevant performance monitoring systems and data for evaluations and  facilitate the sharing of information and lessons learned.         Section 5     Provisions on roles and responsibilities of the Evaluation  Management Committee, the Evaluation Advisory Committee and  Secretariat entities          Evaluation Management Committee    5.1  The Evaluation Management Committee will be a subcommittee of the  Secretary-General's Management Committee, chaired by the Under-Secretary- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance. The Business  Transformation and Accountability Division of the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance will serve as the secretariat to assist the Committee  in exercising its mandate.  5.2 The Evaluation Management Committee advises the Secretary-General (or  designate) on issues relating to the planning, budgeting and policies related to  evaluation. It is intended to foster demand and use of evaluation within the  Organization, to raise awareness of the added value of evaluation and to ensure that  accountabilities for uptake and use of evaluation results are exercised, including  management response and follow-up on the implementation of recommendations.        Evaluation Advisory Committee    5.3 The Evaluation Advisory Committee is an independent external body, appointed  by the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services to advise the Director  of the Inspection and Evaluation Division on issues relating to the evaluation  function, including implementation of the evaluation policy; risk-based planning of  evaluations; recommending improvements to evaluation methodologies, procedures,  quality assurance mechanisms and management response; and ways to enhance the  use of evaluations. The Business Transformation and Accountability Division has  observer status in the Evaluation Advisory Committee.        Secretariat entities    5.4 Evaluation is an integral part of the management of the programme planning  and budgetary cycle. Each head of entity is responsible for ensuring the establishment  of the entity's evaluation policy and an adequately resourced evaluation capacity.   5.5 All heads of Secretariat entities shall:    (a)  Ensure that the conduct of evaluation is functionally independent within  the entity;  ST/AI/2021/3      21-11077  6/6      (b)  Ensure the integration of respect for gender equality and disability  inclusion in evaluation procedures and practices;    (c)  Use qualified external and internal evaluators with relevant professional  competencies and experience, including evaluators from the roster developed and  maintained by the Inspection and Evaluation Division where in-house capacity is  lacking;    (d)  Ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place for management to monitor  and respond to evaluation recommendations, including outlining concrete actions that  are to be undertaken, and to follow up on recommendation implementation;      (e)  Conduct joint evaluations with other Secretariat entities on cross-cutting  areas, including those that contribute to the implementation of the Sustainable  Development Goals, with coordination by the Inspection and Evaluation Division as  required.         Section 6     Resources      6.1  Heads of entities shall ensure adequate capacity and resources to manage and  conduct evaluations and provide effective quality assurance. Heads of entities shall also  ensure that there is adequate capacity to deliver these key roles. Some of these services  may be provided directly by the entity itself, or they may be provided through other  arrangements such as consultancies or long-term agreements with centres of excellence.2  6.2 Secretariat entities shall take into consideration the general view of the Joint  Inspection Unit that funding for evaluation activities should fall within the range of  0.5 to 3 per cent of entity expenditure, depending on the mandate of the entity, its  size, types of evaluation undertaken and the role of evaluation in the entity  (JIU/REP/2014/6, para. 77).          Section 7     Implementation, reporting and review      7.1 The present instruction will come into force at the time of its issuance.   7.2  In accordance with rules 107.2 and 107.3 of the Regulations and Rules Governing  Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of  Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation, the Inspection and Evaluation Division  of OIOS, as the central evaluation unit, will provide further guidance, with support from  the Business Transformation and Accountability Division of the Department of  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, on the implementation of the present  instruction. Nothing in the instruction shall be construed as limiting the operational  independence of OIOS with regard to its mandated activities.  7.3 The instruction will be reviewed two years from the date of issuance.      (Signed) Catherine Pollard  Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy,  Policy and Compliance    __________________    2  Centres of excellence include research institutions, academic institutions and the like that have  evaluation expertise and could provide evaluation services to Secretariat entities.

They must be  prepared to submit any supporting documents, explanations and justifications  requested by the Under-Secretary-General for Management.    (c)  In cases where the goods/services received and the invoice received are  consistent with the details of the commitment, the certification may be deemed to  have taken place at commitment.        20    13-40857    ST/SGB/2013/4         Approving officers          Rule 105.6      (a) Approving officers are designated by the Under-Secretary-General for  Management to approve the entry into the accounts of commitments, disbursements  and expenses relating to contracts, agreements, purchase orders and other forms of  undertaking after verifying that they are in order and have been certified by a duly  designated certifying officer. Approving officers are also responsible for approving  the making of payments once they have ensured that they are properly due,  confirming that the necessary goods and services have been received in accordance  with the contract, agreement, purchase order or other form of undertaking by which  they were ordered and, if the cost exceeds $4,000 (or its equivalent in other  currencies), in accordance with the purpose for which the relevant financial  commitment was established. Approving officers must maintain detailed records and  must be prepared to submit any supporting documents, explanations and  justifications requested by the Under-Secretary-General for Management.    (b)  Approving authority and responsibility is assigned on a personal basis  and cannot be delegated.

(c)  In cases where the goods/services received and the invoice received are  consistent with the details of the commitment, the approval may be deemed to have  taken place at commitment.           Establishment and revision of commitments          Rule 105.7      (a) Apart from the employment of staff against an authorized staffing table  and consequential commitments under the Staff Regulations and Rules and  allocations made to executing agencies, no undertaking, including by contract,  agreement or purchase order, for an amount exceeding $4,000 (or its equivalent in  other currencies) shall be entered into until the appropriate credit(s) has (have) been  reserved in the accounts by the certifying officer. This shall be done through the  recording of commitments against which relevant payments or disbursements may  be made. A commitment shall remain open until such point as it is liquidated,  cancelled or recommitted in accordance with regulations 5.4 and 5.5, as appropriate.    (b)  If, in the time that elapses between the establishment of a commitment  and the processing of final payment, the cost of the relevant goods or services has,  for whatever reason, increased by less than $4,000 (or its equivalent in other  currencies) or 10 per cent of the commitment, whichever is lower, no change need  be made to the amount of the original commitment. If, however, the increase in  costs exceeds $4,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies), the original commitment  must be revised to reflect this increase in requirements and further certification is  required. All increases in commitments shall be subject to the same procedures as  apply to the incurring of original commitments.    13-40857  21      ST/SGB/2013/4      Review, recommitment and cancellation of commitments          Rule 105.8      (a)  Outstanding commitments must be reviewed periodically by the  responsible certifying officer(s). If a commitment is determined to be valid but  cannot be liquidated during the period set forth in regulation 5.3, the provisions of  regulations 5.4 and 5.5 shall, as appropriate, be applied. Commitments that are no  longer valid shall be cancelled from the accounts forthwith and the resulting credit  surrendered.    (b)  When any commitment previously recorded in the accounts is, for any  reason, reduced (other than by payment) or cancelled, the certifying officer shall  accordingly ensure that appropriate adjustments are recorded in the accounts.           Commitment documents          Rule 105.9      A commitment must be based on a formal contract, agreement, purchase order  or other form of undertaking, or on a liability recognized by the United Nations. All  commitments must be supported by an appropriate commitment document.           Peacekeeping reimbursements      Regulation 5.10. Member States that contribute troops and formed police to  peacekeeping operations shall be reimbursed at rates approved by the General  Assembly.

(b)  When a determination is made pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the  Under-Secretary-General for Management shall record the reasons in writing and  may then award a procurement contract, either on the basis of an informal method of  solicitation or on the basis of a directly negotiated contract, to a qualified vendor  whose offer substantially conforms to the requirement at an acceptable price.    13-40857  25      ST/SGB/2013/4      Cooperation          Rule 105.17      (a)  The Under-Secretary-General for Management may cooperate with other  organizations of the United Nations system to meet the procurement requirements of  the United Nations, provided that the regulations and rules of those organizations  are consistent with those of the United Nations.

The Secretary-General shall establish  the composition and the terms of reference of such committees, which shall  include the types and monetary values of proposed procurement actions subject  to review.      (c)  Where the advice of a review committee is required, no final action  leading to the award or amendment of a procurement contract may be taken  before such advice is received. In cases where the Secretary-General decides  not to accept the advice of such a review committee, he or she shall record in  writing the reasons for that decision.          Rule 105.14        Consistent with the principles set out in regulation 5.12 and except as  otherwise provided in rule 105.16, procurement contracts shall be awarded on  the basis of effective competition, and to this end the competitive process shall,  as necessary, include:      (a)  Acquisition planning for developing an overall procurement strategy  and procurement methodologies;      (b)  Market research for identifying potential suppliers;      (c)  Consideration of prudent commercial practices;      (d)  Formal methods of solicitation, utilizing invitations to bid or  requests for proposals on the basis of advertisement or direct solicitation of  invited suppliers, or informal methods of solicitation, such as requests for  quotations.

Such formal and informal methods  of solicitation may be conducted by means of electronic data interchange,  provided the Secretary-General has ensured that the electronic data interchange  system is capable of ensuring authentication and confidentiality of the  information transmitted;      (e)  Public bid openings; for purposes of bidding by means of electronic  data interchange, the virtual opening of bids is considered public.          Rule 105.15        (a)  When a formal invitation to bid has been issued, the procurement  contract shall be awarded to the qualified bidder whose bid substantially  conforms to the requirements set forth in the solicitation documents and is  evaluated to be the one with the lowest cost to the United Nations.      (b)  When a formal request for proposals has been issued, the  procurement contract shall be awarded to the qualified proposer whose proposal,  all factors considered, is the most responsive to the requirements set forth in the  solicitation documents.      (c)  The Secretary-General may, in the interest of the United Nations, reject  bids or proposals for a particular procurement action, recording the reasons for  rejection in writing. The Secretary-General shall then determine whether to  undertake a new solicitation, to directly negotiate a procurement contract pursuant  to rule 105.16 or to terminate or suspend the procurement action.          Rule 105.16        (a)  The Secretary-General may determine for a particular procurement  action that using formal methods of solicitation is not in the best interest of the  United Nations:      (i)  When there is no competitive marketplace for the requirement, such  as where a monopoly exists, where prices are fixed by legislation or  government regulation or where the requirement involves a proprietary  product or service;      (ii) When there has been a previous determination or there is a need to  standardize the requirement;      (iii) When the proposed procurement contract is the result of cooperation  with other organizations of the United Nations system, pursuant to rule  105.17;      (iv) When offers for identical products and services have been obtained  competitively within a reasonable period and the prices and conditions  offered remain competitive;      (v)  When, within a reasonable prior period, a formal solicitation has not  produced satisfactory results;      (vi) When the proposed procurement contract is for the purchase or lease  of real property and market conditions do not allow for effective  competition;      (vii) When there is an exigency for the requirement;      (viii) When the proposed procurement contract relates to obtaining  services that cannot be evaluated objectively;  ST/SGB/2013/4/AMEND.1      18-21493  10/12        (ix) When the Secretary-General otherwise determines that a formal  solicitation will not give satisfactory results;      (x)  When the value of the procurement is below the monetary threshold  established for formal methods of solicitation.      (b)  When a determination is made pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the  Secretary-General shall record the reasons in writing and may then award a  procurement contract, either on the basis of an informal method of solicitation  or on the basis of a directly negotiated contract, to a qualified vendor whose  offer substantially conforms to the requirement at an acceptable price.          Rule 105.17        (a)  The Secretary-General may cooperate with other organizations of the  United Nations system to meet the procurement requirements of the United  Nations, provided that the regulations and rules of those organizations are  consistent with those of the United Nations. The Secretary-General may, as  appropriate, enter into agreements for such purposes. Such cooperation may  include carrying out common procurement actions together or the United  Nations entering into a contract relying on a procurement decision of another  United Nations organization or requesting another United Nations organization  to carry out procurement activities on behalf of the United Nations.      (b)  The Secretary-General may, to the extent authorized by the General  Assembly, cooperate with a Government, non-governmental organization or  other public international organization in respect of procurement activities and,  as appropriate, enter into agreements for such purposes.          Rule 105.18        (a)  Written procurement contracts shall be used to formalize every  procurement action with a monetary value exceeding specific thresholds  established by the Secretary-General. Such arrangements shall, as appropriate,  specify in detail:      (i)  The nature of the products or services being procured;      (ii) The quantity being procured;      (iii) The contract or unit price;      (iv) The period covered;      (v)  Conditions to be fulfilled, including the United Nations general  conditions of contract and implications for non-delivery;      (vi) Terms of delivery and payment;      (vii) Name and address of the supplier.      (b)  The requirement for written procurement contracts shall not be  interpreted to restrict the use of any electronic means of data interchange. Before  any electronic means of data interchange is used, the Secretary-General shall  ensure that the electronic data interchange system is capable of ensuring  authentication and confidentiality of the information transmitted.          Rule 105.19        (a)  Except where normal commercial practice or the interests of the  United Nations so require, no contract or other form of undertaking shall be  made on behalf of the United Nations which requires a payment or payments on    ST/SGB/2013/4/AMEND.1    11/12  18-21493    account in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of contractual  services. Whenever an advance payment is agreed to, the reasons therefor shall  be recorded.      (b)  In addition to paragraph (a) above and notwithstanding rule 105.2,  the Secretary-General may, where necessary, authorize progress payments.          Rule 105.20        The Secretary-General is responsible for the management of the property,  plant and equipment, inventories and intangible assets of the United Nations,  including all systems governing their receipt, valuation, recording, utilization,  safekeeping, maintenance, transfer and disposal, including by sale, and shall  designate the officials responsible for performing property management  functions.          Rule 105.21        Physical verification shall be carried out and records maintained of  property, plant and equipment, inventories and intangible assets of the  Organization, in accordance with policies established by the Secretary-General.          Rule 105.22        (a)  The  Secretary-General  shall  establish  review  bodies  for  Headquarters and other locations to render written advice in respect of loss,  damage, impairment or other discrepancy regarding the property, plant and  equipment, inventories and intangible assets of the United Nations. The  Secretary-General shall establish the composition and terms of reference of such  review bodies, which shall include procedures for determining the cause of such  loss, damage, impairment or other discrepancy, the disposal action to be taken  in accordance with rules 105.23 and 105.24 and the degree of responsibility, if  any, attaching to any official of the United Nations or other party for such loss,  damage or other discrepancy.      (b)  Where the advice of a review body is required, no final action in  respect of United Nations property loss, damage, impairment or other  discrepancy may be taken before such advice is received. In cases where the  Secretary-General decides not to accept the advice of such a body, he or she  shall record in writing, the reasons for that decision.          Rule 105.23        Property, plant and equipment, inventories and intangible assets of the  United Nations that are declared surplus, unserviceable or obsolete following a  recommendation by a review body shall be disposed of, transferred or sold after  competitive bidding, unless the review body:      (a)  Estimates that the sales value is less than an amount to be specified  by the Secretary-General;      (b)  Considers that the exchange of property in partial or full payment for  replacement equipment or supplies is in the best interest of the Organization;      (c)  Deems it appropriate to transfer surplus property from one project or  operation for use in another and determines the fair market value at which the  transfer(s) shall be effected;  ST/SGB/2013/4/AMEND.1      18-21493  12/12        (d)  Determines that the destruction of the surplus or unserviceable  material will be more economical or is required by law or by the nature of the  property;      (e)  Determines that the interests of the United Nations will be served  through the disposal of the property by gift or by sale at a nominal price to an  intergovernmental organization, a Government or governmental agency or some  other non-profit organization.           Article VI        Accounting            Rule 106.2        Responsibility for the accounts is assigned to the Secretary-General, who  shall establish accounting systems.          Rule 106.5        (a)  The Secretary-General shall establish the operational rates of  exchange between the United States dollar and other currencies. The operational  rates of exchange shall be used for recording all United Nations transactions.      (b)  Receipts and payments in currencies other than the United States  dollar shall be recorded on the basis of the operational rate of exchange  prevailing on the transaction date. Any difference between the actual amount on  exchange and the amount that would have been obtained at the operational rate  of exchange shall be accounted for as loss or gain on exchange.      (c)  When closing the final accounts for a financial period, any negative  balance on the account for ""loss or gain on exchange"" shall be debited to other  expenses, while any positive balance on the account for ""loss or gain on  exchange"" shall be credited to other/miscellaneous revenue.          Rule 106.7        (a)  The Secretary-General may, after investigation, authorize the  writing-off of losses of assets, including cash, receivables, property, plant and  equipment, inventories and intangible assets. A summary statement of losses  shall be provided to the Board of Auditors not later than three months following  the end of the financial period.      (b)  The investigation shall in each case fix the responsibility, if any,  attaching to any official(s) of the United Nations for the loss or losses. Such  official(s) may be required to reimburse the United Nations either partially or  in full. Final determination as to all surcharges to be made against staff members  or others as the result of losses will be made by the Secretary-General.          Rule 106.8        Accounting and other financial records and all supporting documents shall  be retained for established periods in accordance with policies after which, on  approval of the Secretary-General, they may be destroyed.  5.  The present amendments shall enter into force on 1 January 2019.      (Signed) Antonio Guterres  Secretary-General  "

Section 6     Verification and control of property      6.1 Pursuant  to  financial  rule  105.21,  the  Under-Secretary-General  for  Management shall establish policies for the verification and control of property as  follows.  6.2 Unless as provided otherwise (see sects. 6.3 to 6.5), all property of the United  Nations shall be monitored and controlled throughout the life cycle of each item of  property, from receipt to disposal. Physical verification of the property of the United  Nations shall be conducted regularly and as deemed necessary to ensure adequate  control over the property.   6.3 Expendable property shall be monitored and controlled until it is issued for use  or consumption. A physical verification may be performed when, in the discretion of  the head of department or office concerned, such verification is necessary to ensure  adequate control over the property and accountability.   6.4 For capitalized property, the physical verification shall be performed at least  once during each financial year. The findings of the verification process shall be  reconciled with the property records.   6.5 For intangible property, the verification shall be conducted at such times, with  such frequency and using such methods as are necessary and appropriate, or as may  be required by an agreement with a third party in order to ensure the appropriate use  and custody of the intangible property. Appropriate control systems for intangible  property shall be put in place.   6.6 Property of the United Nations that has been issued by a department or office  to staff members for use outside United Nations premises shall be monitored to  ensure that it is properly accounted for and that related records are maintained.   6.7 Property of the United Nations issued to, made available to, or otherwise used  by, a staff member shall be returned to the United Nations, through, if possible, the  issuing department or office, when required by the issuing department or office,  upon the staff member's separation from service, or, if required, upon his or her  reassignment or transfer to another department or office.

Introduction 1. The present report has been submitted pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, in which the Assembly mandated the Secretary-General to submit annually to the Assembly a report under the agenda item entitled ""Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations"" addressing the measures aimed at strengthening accountability in the Secretariat. This report also responds to paragraph 11 of resolution 59/264 A of 23 December 2004 and paragraph 7 of resolution 59/264 B of 22 June 2005, in which the Assembly called, respectively, for an assessment of the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, and an assessment of progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors. 2. Since the submission to the General Assembly of the last report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Accountability and responsibility"" (A/55/270 of 3 August 2000), there have been continuing efforts to strengthen accountability at the United Nations. However, the Secretariat is now facing an unprecedented series of organizational challenges which have exposed shortcomings in the way it conducts its business. The Secretary-General is therefore taking additional actions where it is within his authority to do so, particularly in the critical areas of the accountability framework, oversight, ethics and transparency. 3. This report is organized into six parts covering the following headings: measures for strengthening the accountability framework; assessment of experiences with audit committees; establishment of oversight mechanisms; ensuring ethical conduct; enhancing transparency; and timely implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies. II. Measures to strengthen the accountability framework 4. The accountability framework at the United Nations is based on a hierarchy headed by the General Assembly that flows through the Secretary-General, senior managers and middle management to all other staff. Annex I to this report provides a schematic representation of this structure and the mechanisms that support it. At each level in the hierarchy, it is essential that there be clearly defined responsibilities and performance expectations and that there be mechanisms in place that enable both routine and formal assessment of performance. The measures described in the present section of this report are aimed at ensuring that: (a) the Secretary-General receives the necessary advice to properly assess the performance of senior managers; (b) executive-level decisions are clearly understood and followed up; (c) senior managers understand what is expected from them; and (d) the mechanism for formal appraisal of all staff, including managers, is improved. A. Reconstituting of the Accountability Panel as the Management Performance Board 5. Through the promulgation of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/13, which took effect from 13 May 2005, the Secretary-General has replaced the 5 A/60/312 Accountability Panel with the Management Performance Board. The Board's terms of reference and responsibilities are clearer and better defined than those of the Panel. The Board will advise the Secretary-General on matters concerning the performance of individual senior managers. Its functions include reviewing the material recommendations of the Oversight Committee (see sect. IV of this report) and ensuring that managers act on serious managerial issues identified by its oversight bodies. It will also monitor the manner in which senior managers exercise all aspects of the authority that has been delegated to them, including their performance in achieving the objectives contained in human resources action plans, and review the outcome of the administration of justice proceedings in the Secretariat for management accountability purposes. 6. The members of the Management Performance Board will be appointed by the Secretary-General for a two-year term, which may be renewable. Its membership will consist of a chairperson, who will be the Deputy Secretary-General, two members at the Under-Secretary-General level and an external expert in public sector management. 7. In July 2005, the Deputy Secretary-General chaired the first organizational meeting of the Management Performance Board, which conducted a review of existing sources of managerial performance data. The Department of Management was requested to review methods of performance assessments used in other comparable organizations, with a view to preparing proposals for a set of qualitative and quantitative performance indicators covering both programmatic and managerial functions that would enable a high-level evaluation of a senior manager's performance. The Board is expected to consider these proposals at its next meeting in the fourth quarter of 2005. B. Improving executive-level decision-making 8. Recognizing the value in having the ability to take high-level decisions on a timely basis and in an effort to ensure that mechanisms would be in place to hold senior management accountable for follow-up action, the Secretary-General established a Senior Management Group as part of his initial reform programme in 1997. The Group comprised all heads of Secretariat departments and United Nations offices, funds and programmes. As a result, coordination and coherence within the United Nations family have since been enhanced. In practice, however, while having real utility as an information-sharing body, the Group has proved too large for effective and timely decision-making. Consequently, two smaller senior-level committees, a Policy Committee and a Management Committee -- both chaired by the Secretary-General -- have been created. The modus operandi of these Committees will ensure clear expectations, and clear definition of responsibility and timelines for implementation. As of 30 June 2005, the Policy Committee had met on six occasions since its establishment in May 2005 and has presented the Secretary- General with policy options on a wide range of issues. The Management Committee held its first meeting on 20 May 2005 to review progress made to date on management reform and later met in July 2005 to endorse a number of reform proposals. 6 A/60/312 C. Introducing mandatory induction programmes for senior officials 9. A more robust approach to ensuring that senior officials are adequately informed on the broader system of United Nations regulations and rules, code of conduct and managerial systems is required. To meet this need, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations piloted its first induction session in June 2005 for a group of newly appointed leaders in a number of field missions. The programme, which is intended to be conducted biannually, will cover sessions on conduct and requirements for management performance. At the same time, a broader induction programme for senior-level recruits is being developed in the rest of the United Nations Secretariat. It is expected that this will be launched by the end of 2005. A consolidated reference guide on delegation of authority has been prepared and will act both as a training aid during the induction programmes and as a reference document designed to clarify the responsibilities that are delegated to senior officials. D. Defining performance expectations for programme delivery 10. An essential component of the accountability framework is the clear and meaningful measurement of programme delivery. To this end, as part of the Secretary-General's first round of reforms, results-based budgeting was introduced. A comprehensive set of performance indicators for all programmes, including peacekeeping missions, have now been developed. For the programme budget for 2004-2005 and the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007, performance measures, namely, baselines and targets, have also been included. 11. To gain maximum benefit from these performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation are being enhanced. The Office of Internal Oversight Services presented its latest recommendations on this subject to the General Assembly in its reports on strengthening the role of evaluation findings in programme design, delivery and policy directives (see A/59/79) and further specific proposals (which were prepared jointly with the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU)) on the strengthening and monitoring of programme  performance  and  evaluation  (A/60/73).  The  measures  being implemented will include improvements in data-collection and monitoring systems and strengthening of self-evaluation. Programme managers are required to include in their budget proposals for the biennium 2006-2007 adequate resources to effectively evaluate their programme performance. 12. The improvements in monitoring and evaluation combined with the performance indicators contained in the biennial programme plan and the programme budget will provide the basis for objective reporting of performance both to Member States through the programme performance report and to the new Management Performance Board. These inputs, together with the independent inspection and evaluation reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU, will put the Board in a position to provide the Secretary-General with the advice he needs to hold his senior managers accountable for the results they achieve in delivering their work programmes. 7 A/60/312 E. Enhancing the Performance Appraisal System 13. As part of the overall accountability framework, the e-PAS is the formal tool employed in holding staff accountable for their performance. The system has the basic objective of creating a fair, equitable, transparent and measurable system of performance management in support of a results-based culture that recognizes and rewards excellent performance while adequately addressing underperformance. The system applies to all staff and managers except the heads of departments who are currently subject to annual assessment through their programme management plans. The e-PAS represents an enhancement of the original Performance Appraisal System (PAS), and was introduced after extensive consultations throughout the Secretariat. Incorporated into the revised e-PAS system are the following features: (a) The organizational core values and competencies, in order to provide a fuller picture of performance; (b) Self-assessment by staff members; (c) The managerial competencies for supervisory staff so as to provide an assessment of their supervisory skills; (d) Strengthened links between performance management and career development; (e) Enhanced accountability measures such as the inclusion of an optional section in the e-PAS for the comments of staff on supervision received. F. Requiring personal financial liability of staff 14. The Secretary-General has defined the conditions, through staff rules 112.3, 212.2 and 312.2, under which staff members may be required to reimburse the United Nations, either partially or in full, for any financial loss suffered by the Organization as a result of the staff member's gross negligence or violation of the regulations and procedures. To that end, administrative instruction ST/AI/2004/3 of 29 September 2004 was promulgated. The instructions also define the conditions for implementing financial rule 101.2, under which any staff member who violates the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) or corresponding administrative instructions, may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions. III. Assessment of experience with audit and oversight committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations 15. At its fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly, in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/264 A, having taken note of the Secretariat's effort in collecting information on the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, requested the Secretary-General to report on and provide an assessment of its findings to the Assembly at its sixtieth session. 8 A/60/312 16. The Secretariat collected the information on audit committees during 2004. Thirty-three organizations were involved, grouped in four categories: specialized agencies and related organizations; funds and programmes; multinational financial institutions; and other international organizations. The Secretariat's analysis revealed that 60 per cent of the organizations involved in the survey had already established an oversight mechanism (see annex II). These oversight mechanisms were referred to as either audit committees or oversight committees. It is worth noting that even the organizations that do not have an institutionalized audit committee have set up mechanisms to review internal and external audit matters as well as progress made in implementing audit recommendations. In some of these cases, it is the relevant programme and budget committee that plays this role. 17. When considering the role of the audit committees within an organization, it is important to recognize the distinction between the committees that operate as advisory panels to either the respective executive heads or the executive boards and those that are part of the governing body of the organization. The latter is the case in most of the multinational financial institutions like the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 18. The responsibilities of the oversight committees generally include: (a) Reviewing the strategy and workplans of internal and, in some organizations, external audit; and discussing the scope and content of their audits so as to identify audit priorities and suggesting potential audit areas within which to address the organization's risks; (b) Reviewing the findings and recommendations emanating from the reports, inspection and investigations, including those on irregularities and fraud; (c) Ensuring that appropriate and timely actions are taken by the management in implementing the recommendations of the internal and external oversight bodies and monitoring follow-up action thereon. 19. In addition, other responsibilities of some of the committees include: (a) Assessing the integrity of the financial statements of the organizations and their accounting, financial reporting and disclosure policies and practices; (b) Reviewing risk management and the internal control system; (c) Making recommendations with regard to the appointments and tenure of members of the external board of auditors; (d) Assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of internal and external audit services; (e) Providing an open avenue of communication between the governing board, management and the functions of internal and external audit; (f) Serving as an issue resolution forum in cases where there are differences in respect of opinions or recommendations between managers and auditors or investigators, or among the auditors themselves; (g) Promoting an organization-wide culture that accepts the importance and value of the internal audit, inspection and investigation functions and providing 9 A/60/312 executive heads with the assurance that these functions are operating effectively and efficiently. Composition 20. In general, the membership of the committees ranges from six to nine members, primarily high-ranking or senior management officers. However, external (United Nations or non-United Nations) members are strategically included either because of their present position as is the case at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) or because of their professional qualifications, expertise and/or competence as is the case at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). External members usually serve for a two-year renewable term. Meetings 21. The committees generally meet up to four times per annum. However the chairperson in most cases possesses the discretionary authority to call additional meetings if deemed appropriate, for example, to initiate discussion of emerging audit matters. The executive head in some instances can also request that the chairperson convene a meeting. Reporting 22. The committees generally report to either the executive head or to the governing body (for example, the executive council). It is worth noting that the committees within the United Nations system generally report to their executive heads, while the committees within the multinational financial institutions and other international organizations report to their executive boards. IV. Strengthening of the oversight mechanisms 23. Independent oversight is an essential part of any comprehensive system of accountability. At the United Nations, there are three main bodies that provide this function, namely, the Board of Auditors, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU. Without the audit of financial statements, the investigation of complaints, the evaluation of programme performance, and all the other reviews carried out by these bodies, both internal management and the governing bodies would not have an impartial assessment of the functioning of the Organization or, where shortcomings are identified, be in a position to hold accountable those responsible. It is therefore essential that the oversight bodies be independent, have the capacity to carry out their functions, and provide full coverage of all aspects of the functioning of the Organization. It is also essential that effective follow-up action be taken on the basis of their findings, including implementation of recommendations and analysis of their reports, to address systemic weaknesses. The measures described in the present section of this report address these issues. 10 A/60/312 A. Establishment of the United Nations Oversight Committee 24. As has been described in section III of this report, the Secretariat initiated a review of audit committees in order to establish a similar body at the United Nations. Pursuant to the initiation of this review, the General Assembly, in resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, requested the establishment of a high-level follow-up mechanism under the authority of the Secretary-General to effectively feed findings and recommendations of the oversight bodies into the executive management processes. 25. Utilizing the findings of the Secretariat's review, terms of reference for a United Nations Oversight Committee have been prepared and are ready for issuance. The Oversight Committee will function as an independent advisory panel to the Secretary-General. Its objectives include ensuring the systematic implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies; sharing audit-related information and lessons learned within the Secretariat, where appropriate; and ensuring that significant risks to the Organization are identified and mitigating measures taken. Its responsibilities will include: (a) Ensuring that appropriate and timely action is taken by the relevant managers to rectify problems in areas of concern identified by oversight bodies, and to effectively manage risks within the organization; (b) Alerting the Secretary-General on systemic organizational issues that may arise from audit, investigation or evaluation reports, and making recommendations as appropriate; (c) On behalf of the Secretary-General, providing advice and suggestions on the priorities, long-term strategy and annual audit workplans of oversight bodies and requesting that significant risks identified be included in such workplans; (d) Preparing the Secretary-General's response to reports of oversight bodies submitted to the General Assembly, taking into account the input provided by the departments or offices concerned; (e) Rendering advice on audit related-matters to the Secretary-General and departmental heads as it deems appropriate; (f) Encouraging and facilitating, if necessary, collaboration and cooperation among the various oversight bodies. 26. The Secretary-General will appoint a Chairperson and three additional members to the Committee. The Chairperson and two of the members will be senior Secretariat officials at a rank no lower than that of Assistant Secretary-General. The other member will be external to the Secretariat. Members of the Committee shall serve for a period of two years, renewable once, with the renewal period phased so as to provide continuity. Committee members shall act in an independent capacity while performing their advisory role on the Committee. The Committee shall meet at the request of the Chairperson or any member as required but no less than once every calendar quarter. The Under-Secretary-General for Management will attend meetings in an ex officio capacity. 27. The Committee is required to produce an annual report on its work for the previous year, which will be presented to the Secretary-General during the first calendar quarter of each year. The Committee will also contribute to the annual 11 A/60/312 report to the General Assembly on measures taken to improve accountability in the Secretariat. 28. It should be noted that some of the functions identified during the review of the audit committees of other organizations have not been included in the terms of reference  of  the  Oversight  Committee.  These  would  include  making recommendations on the resource requirements of the various oversight bodies; assessment of the efforts of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Board of Auditors and JIU to strengthen the Organization's internal controls; and the identification of possible gaps in the United Nations oversight coverage. It is considered that these functions would not be appropriately discharged by a committee reporting directly to the Secretary-General. However, additional strengthening of United Nations oversight is currently under discussion in the General Assembly. B. Enhancement of fraud and corruption prevention mechanisms 29. In paragraph 349 of volume I of the report of the Board of Auditors (A/59/5 (vol. I), chap. I), the Board recommended, inter alia, that the Administration: (a) Implement a comprehensive and well-communicated corruption and fraud prevention plan in the United Nations system; (b) Establish a corruption and fraud prevention committee that would serve as an effective framework and coordination point for a United Nations system corruption and fraud prevention mechanism; (c) Conduct ethics, corruption and fraud awareness training sessions and workshops among managers, international and local employees and other stakeholders; (d) Develop appropriate resolution mechanisms for reported and detected incidents and allegations of corruption and fraud. A clarification was obtained from the Board that the word ""system"" mentioned in its recommendation referred to the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 30. The United Nations already has in place many rules, procedures and controls designed to prevent fraud and corruption. However, based on the Board's recommendation, new efforts have been initiated to draw a more comprehensive plan, addressing all aspects of corruption and fraud prevention. To that end, a working group has been established to propose such a plan. As a first step, the working group is drawing up an anti-corruption and fraud prevention policy which will draw on existing best practices, including the model recently developed by the World Bank. 31. The working group will also propose an effective mechanism through which to coordinate the efforts on corruption and fraud prevention of the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 32. A training programme will be part of the overall corruption and fraud prevention plan. It will include general awareness training, as well as specific modules for functions where the risk of fraud and corruption is higher. The programme will address staff at all levels of the Organization. 12 A/60/312 C. Efforts to strengthen the Office of Internal Oversight Services 33. The Office of Internal Oversight Services in its tenth annual report to the General Assembly (see A/59/359) provided the results of its own self-evaluation to assist the Assembly in carrying out its review and evaluation of the Office in 2004. The self-evaluation exercise looked at strengths and weaknesses and pointed to areas where the Office could be improved. In addition, in his note transmitting the annual report to the Assembly, the Secretary-General recommended to the Assembly that the Office undergo a comprehensive external review in order to strengthen its capacity to carry out all aspects of its work. That recommendation was reiterated in paragraph 192 of the Secretary-General's report entitled ""In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all"" (A/59/2005). 34. The General Assembly in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/272 affirmed that any external review of the Office of Internal Oversight Services could be undertaken only by such bodies as the Board of Auditors or JIU, or those mandated to do so by the Assembly. It is recommended that the scope of such a review should include the investigation processes at offices away from Headquarters as recommended by the Board. 35. Apart from any external review that may be undertaken as a result of the Secretary-General's proposals above, measures have already been taken to strengthen the investigation function of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. In resolution 59/287 of 13 April 2005, the General Assembly re-emphasized that the Office was the internal body entrusted with investigation in the United Nations and therefore decided that the results of all preliminary investigations conducted by programme managers should be reported to the Office. Pursuant to the adoption of this resolution, the Office now has independent, residual and exclusive authority to investigate the most serious cases (all ""category one"" cases, that is to say, all high- risk, complex matters and serious criminal cases). An added layer of oversight determines that the Office must be informed of the results of all ""category two"" cases (cases of lower risk to the Organization) investigated by programme managers, so that the Office can have an overview of all matters that have been investigated by the Organization. D. Review of governance structures and the format of accountability reports 36. The way in which financial reports and reports of oversight bodies are considered and acted upon represents an essential part of the accountability process. Recognizing this, the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 57/278 A of 20 December 2002 (later reaffirmed in resolution 59/264 A) requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to examine governance structures, principles and accountability throughout the United Nations system and to make proposals on the future format and consideration of the reports of the Board of Auditors by the respective executive boards and the Assembly. The matter was taken up and discussed by the High-level Committee on Management (HLCM) at its eighth session, held in Rome on 5 and 6 October 2004. At that session, the Committee decided that, in the first instance, this item should be carried forward by the Finance and Budget Network, in particular as regards format and consideration of the reports of the Board of 13 A/60/312 Auditors, and requested that the secretariat of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) carry out consultations with the Board of Auditors and obtain more detailed information on the scope and objectives of this review (see CEB/2004/6, para. 60). Member States are currently seized with the subject of strengthening governance arrangements in the context of the discussions on the outcome document for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the Assembly. 37. Related to this subject is the recommendation of the Board of Auditors that covered the issue of governance principles and best practices related to financial reporting. It pointed out that in its view, the following governance issues were normally reported on in a medium such as the financial report that preceded the financial statements: (a) governance and other regulatory bodies; (b) performance reporting and non-financial information; (c) social accounting issues; and (d) risk management, continuity and internal control (A/59/5/Add.2, chap. II, para. 25). 38. At its ninth session held at Geneva in April 2005, the High-level Committee on Management decided to set up a working group to examine current accountability mechanisms in organizations, to raise awareness of such tools and to identify best practices (see CEB/2005/3, para. 22 (f)). It was recognized that this issue was very broad and was related to overall organizational culture and not just audit processes (ibid., para. 21). Therefore, the working group will comprise representatives of budget, finance and human resources management. The terms of reference of this working group will, inter alia, include addressing the resolutions and recommendations referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 above. V. Ensuring ethical conduct 39. The commitment to the highest ethical standards at the United Nations is a core value and fundamental guiding principle in ensuring that the Organization achieves its mission. In response to the findings of a Secretariat-wide staff survey, the probes into the management of the oil-for-food programme and the allegations of sexual misconduct in various peace missions, the United Nations has begun implementing additional measures to address deficiencies and ensure a culture of ethical conduct. A. Proposed establishment of the United Nations Office of Ethics 40. Underlying the main effort of the Secretariat in that regard is the proposal for the establishment of an independent Office of Ethics, the head of which will report directly to the Secretary-General. The objective of the Office will be to assist the Organization in maintaining the highest standards of integrity, as required by the Charter of the United Nations and thereby maintain and enhance international confidence in the United Nations through fostering a culture of ethical conduct, transparency and accountability, setting and disseminating standards for appropriate professional conduct and providing leadership, management and oversight of the United Nations ethics infrastructure. Proposals for the establishment of the Office of Ethics, along with its terms of reference, are currently under preparation for the consideration of the General Assembly. 14 A/60/312 B. Financial disclosure by senior officials 41. In July 2005, the Secretary-General decided to broaden the scope of financial disclosure, as currently required of senior officials, including those employed on a short-term basis or under special conditions. This followed a review of disclosure practices in comparable organizations. The appropriate mechanisms for monitoring these disclosures are also under review for immediate strengthening. It is envisaged that the scope of annual financial disclosure and declaration of interest will be broadened from the Assistant Secretary-General/Under-Secretary-General level to include all staff at the D-1 level and above. The financial disclosure threshold levels will be lowered for assets and income from $25,000 to $10,000 and for gifts from $10,000 to $250. 42. The financial disclosure programme will be administered by the proposed Office of Ethics, pursuant to its establishment. The implementation of the expanded financial disclosure regime will require an amendment of staff regulation 1.2 (n) by the General Assembly. C. Protection against retaliation for exposure of wrongdoing or reporting of irregularities and misconduct 43. The Secretary-General is finalizing a comprehensive policy to ensure protection against retaliation for reporting of alleged misconduct. This policy will complement existing administrative issuances concerning avenues for the reporting of alleged misconduct that are set out in information circular ST/IC/2005/19. It is essential that staff have confidence in these mechanisms and assurance that the appropriate level of protection is provided. For this reason, additional rounds of consultation with the staff have been conducted on the terms of the new policy. D. Enhancement of codes of conduct and conflict-of-interest rules 44. While the United Nations has in place a detailed Code of Conduct readily available to all staff on the Intranet, it is now planned to disseminate the Code in other ways. The Secretary-General has commissioned the design of a user-friendly orientation and information booklet for distribution in the latter part of 2005 to all staff based on the Secretary-General's bulletin on the status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members (ST/SGB/2002/13). Special additional rules are also being developed for staff engaged in procurement activities. In this respect, a Declaration of Independence to be signed by all staff members working in the procurement process has been prepared and an administrative issuance on rules governing the conduct of staff engaged in procurement activities is being finalized for adoption by the Secretary-General. A United Nations Supplier Code of Conduct is also being formulated. It is expected that all these materials will be produced and ready for dissemination in the near future. 45. The Office of Ethics, once established, will be responsible for standard-setting on ethics issues and training, in coordination with the Office of Human Resources Management. 15 A/60/312 E. Incorporation of ethics into staff training programmes 46. Staff will be required to complete a new downloadable content module on integrity and ethics provisions for self-training that has now been completed in the form of a CD-ROM. In addition, ethics modules have been incorporated into all existing training programmes for United Nations staff, including at induction, and the Career Resources Centre (CRC) offers a lunchtime programme on ethics. It is envisaged that both the CD-ROM on integrity and the Career Resources Centre ethics programme will be mandatory for all staff. F. Protection against harassment in the workplace 47. While the United Nations has a zero tolerance sexual harassment policy in place, the Secretary-General is in the process of formulating a new, broader policy to encompass other forms of harassment. This will be introduced following consultation with the staff representative bodies. The United Nations Secretariat has also joined the United Nations Development Group in the development and implementation of an online learning programme on harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority, which, once available, will be mandatory for all staff. G. Response to allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by field personnel 48. In addition to the efforts in place for dealing with the issues of harassment and sexual misconduct, in response to the widespread allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse at some United Nations peacekeeping operations, there has been aggressive pursuit by the Organization of such cases. As of July 2005, across all peacekeeping operations, 186 peacekeepers had been investigated for sexual exploitation and abuse; 7 United Nations civilians had been summarily dismissed; and 80 members of military contingents had been expelled from the field missions. Investigations into such allegations are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Haiti in particular. Additionally, a number of short- and medium-term initiatives are under way, including: (a) The introduction of a unified standard of conduct across all categories of peacekeeping personnel. Mandatory training on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse has been integrated into all mission induction programmes. Improved complaint mechanisms have been established in all missions, including telephone hotlines and a network of Focal Points for Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, who receive complaints in person. In addition, missions are ensuring that victims of sexual abuse are referred to existing emergency assistance (medical, psychosocial, legal) in the mission area; (b) A global review of the state of discipline in peacekeeping operations conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the results of which are currently being analysed; (c) The establishment by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of a Conduct and Discipline Unit at United Nations Headquarters. Over the coming months, similar capacity will be created in eight Department of Peacekeeping 16 A/60/312 Operations missions. The Units will focus on preventing misconduct through various means, including awareness-raising and training and improving welfare and recreation facilities. Other key activities of such Units will include tracking data on misconduct cases for all categories of peacekeeping personnel and developing measures to ensure compliance with United Nations standards of conduct, such as the establishment of lists of premises considered out of bounds for United Nations personnel. Such Units will work with in-country networks on sexual exploitation and abuse, developed to better coordinate and share information on this problem; (d) The approval by the General Assembly in June 2005 of 19 new Office of Internal Oversight Services investigator positions, as well as additional investigative resources for following up allegations of misconduct in peacekeeping missions. 49. In the longer term, a comprehensive review will be undertaken of the welfare and recreation needs of all peacekeeping personnel, as well as the development of a comprehensive strategy for victim assistance. New agreements with troop- contributing countries and United Nations partners will be developed. In addition, a group of legal experts will be examining ways to ensure that United Nations staff and experts on mission are held responsible for criminal acts committed in countries where no functioning judicial system exists. H. Dissemination of information concerning the Secretary-General's decisions in disciplinary matters 50. Starting  in  2002,  two  information  circulars  (ST/IC/2002/25  and ST/IC/2004/28) were issued that informed all staff of the Secretary-General's practice in disciplinary matters. It is expected that the sharing of information with staff members concerning decisions on disciplinary cases will not only raise awareness and enhance transparency in disciplinary matters, but also have a deterrent effect and thus enhance ethical conduct. VI. Enhancing transparency 51. Transparency is an essential feature of any system of accountability. By making decision-making processes, performance data, transaction processing, and general information about the Organization more accessible, the United Nations becomes more accountable to Member States, staff and civil society. A major vehicle for improving transparency has been Internet technology, and the United Nations home page has been enhanced during the last few years to become a strategic communication tool. Efforts are also ongoing to increase awareness inside the United Nations of Intranet capabilities, and build on existing features, such as the Procurement and Facilities Management tracking systems, that give transparency to administrative processes. In addition to the continuous expansion of the Intranet, Extranet and Internet, there are other measures aimed at improving the openness of the operation of the United Nations, which are described below. 17 A/60/312 A. Access to United Nations information 52. The Secretary-General has initiated an assessment of best practices in public administrations around the world and examined various models of information access in different countries in developing a clear and consistent policy for determining which United Nations documents should be accessible outside the Secretariat. In the latter part of 2005, the Management Committee will review this comprehensive assessment and will provide guidance for a new policy. It should be noted that access to United Nations documentation that is neither restricted nor confidential is now freely available on the Internet through the Official Document System. B. Selection and appointment of senior officials 53. In order to enhance transparency in the appointment of senior officials, the Secretary-General has put in place a new selection process which ensures a much wider search for qualified candidates and allows for a rigorous, open process against predetermined criteria for all senior United Nations officials and heads of United Nations funds and programmes. As part of the new mechanism, the Senior Appointment Group (SAG) reviews candidatures for appointment by the Secretary- General. The Chef de Cabinet then constitutes an interview panel with a minimum of four members of the Group. The names of two or more finalists are then submitted to the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General for final consideration. 54. In the case of senior appointments that involve intergovernmental bodies in the appointment process (for example, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the Office of Internal Oversight Services), shortlists are drawn up from a list of nominations submitted in response to a request for such nomination by the Secretary-General addressed to Members States and relevant institutions. Shortlists would also be developed through a more informal process of outreach and search. In the case of Secretariat appointments of a specialized nature, an outside technical expert may be invited to be part of the relevant interview panel. In all cases, clear job descriptions and required competencies will have been developed against which candidates can be judged. A more systematic process of vetting and reference-checking of candidates will be instituted, with external assistance whenever necessary. The Secretary-General will in all cases have the ultimate authority to make the final selection, taking into account other factors, such as geographical distribution and gender balance. Since the establishment of this new procedure, several senior-level posts have been filled via the new system, including those of UNDP, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and UNHCR. C. Senior Review Group 55. The Secretary-General has constituted a Senior Review Group as a standing advisory body to make recommendations to the Secretary-General on appointment and promotion to posts at the D-2 level. For the purpose of defining the terms of 18 A/60/312 reference of the Group, Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/4 was promulgated on 28 February 2005 and the membership of the Group was presented in information circular ST/IC/2005/33 of 1 July 2005. In accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the Secretary-General's bulletin, all appointments to this body are made by the Secretary-General. According to section 3, all D-2 vacancy announcements, except for vacant posts in the Executive Office of the Secretary- General and for the special envoys, are to be circulated. D. External validation of the procurement system 56. The Volcker Inquiry was critical of various United Nations procurement cases in the early years of the oil-for-food programme. However, since the mid-1990s, a major overhaul of the United Nations procurement process has been undertaken, making it more transparent and addressing any shortcomings identified in a number of different reviews. In the light of issues raised by the Volcker Inquiry, the Secretary-General commissioned a review, completed in June 2005, that compared existing procurement rules and regulations with the best global practices of outside organizations and companies in order to ensure that the improvements introduced since the mid to late 1990s met the highest global standards. In addition, in August 2005, the Secretary-General commissioned a full financial and internal control review of the United Nations current procurement system. 57. The June 2005 review evaluated positively the transparency achieved by the United Nations Procurement Service website. The review stated that the Service website (http://www.un.org/Depts/ptd) was an extensive, well-designed site with current information directly relevant to the needs of prospective and active suppliers and that the transparent and open approach of the Service to sourcing and vendor development was directly in line with that of leading public procurement agencies. E. Accounting standards 58. The adoption of clear standards for accounting purposes is essential for transparent financial reporting. The High Level Committee on Management has approved a project for the development of such accounting standards within the United Nations system. This project is being undertaken by a Task Force under the auspices of the Committee's Finance and Budget Network. Possible standards have been identified and final proposals will be submitted by the Task Force to the Finance and Budget Network for approval prior to their presentation to the Committee for endorsement. VII. Time frames for implementation of the recommendations of the oversight bodies 59. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 59/264 A, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to indicate expected time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors, including the office-holders to be held accountable. A similar request was later reiterated in paragraph 6 of resolution 264 B; and in paragraph 7 of the same resolution, the Secretary-General 19 A/60/312 was further requested to provide an assessment to the Assembly at its sixtieth session on the progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of recommendations of the Board. 60. As per annex III of the present report, approximately 73 per cent of the recommendations addressed to the United Nations, and reported as outstanding to the Board of Auditors as at the end of June 2004, had time frames assigned for implementation. For the United Nations University (UNU), the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, time frames were provided in 82 per cent, 50 per cent, 40 per cent and 47 per cent of cases, respectively. For all four organizations, the office-holders responsible for implementation were clearly identified for all outstanding recommendations. The progress towards proper assignment of time frames was acknowledged by the Board in paragraph 1 (a) of its current report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session on the status of implementation of its recommendations relating to the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex). 61. Owing to the high priority given to the implementation of all the approved recommendations of the Board of Auditors and the other oversight bodies, efforts have been intensified by the Secretariat to ensure that the recommendations of the other oversight bodies, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU also have responsible  office-holders  assigned  and  time  frames  defined  for  their implementation. The Oversight Committee will have an overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with these requirements. 62. Overall progress is being made towards improving implementation rates. The Board of Auditors was pleased to note that the overall proportion of implementation of 34 per cent of the previous biennium had increased to 46 per cent in the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex, para. 9). VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 63. This report describes the measures taken by the Secretary-General to strengthen the system of accountability at the United Nations. In formulating these measures, the Secretary-General has taken into account the need for: (a) the clear definition of authority and results to be achieved; (b) the establishment of appropriate support and guidance mechanisms; (c) the strengthening of systems to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of performance; and (d) the provision of follow-up mechanisms that lead to appropriate recognition of both good and unsatisfactory performance, and investigations and appropriate corrective action if necessary. 64. Many of the measures described, such as the establishment of the Management Performance Board and the proposed establishment of the Office of Ethics, will themselves lead to a further examination of the way that the United Nations 20 A/60/312 conducts its business and to additional measures to improve the system of accountability. Together with those already described in this report, they will help achieve the goal of ensuring that programme managers and staff are held accountable for the effective delivery of their work and the way they conduct themselves, and that both management and staff operate in an open and transparent environment, free from unethical conduct. 65. The General Assembly may wish to take note of this report, including of the fact that new elements are being added to the accountability framework that will strengthen accountability in the Secretariat. 21 A/60/312 Annex I The accountability framework Responsibility and authority Accountability Mechanism       Charter of the United Nations General Assembly and other intergovernmental bodies Provide mandates and overall policy guidance to the Secretary-General for the execution of these mandates as well as those given to the Secretary-General directly by the Charter of the United Nations.

Introduction 1. The present report has been submitted pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, in which the Assembly mandated the Secretary-General to submit annually to the Assembly a report under the agenda item entitled ""Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations"" addressing the measures aimed at strengthening accountability in the Secretariat. This report also responds to paragraph 11 of resolution 59/264 A of 23 December 2004 and paragraph 7 of resolution 59/264 B of 22 June 2005, in which the Assembly called, respectively, for an assessment of the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, and an assessment of progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors. 2. Since the submission to the General Assembly of the last report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Accountability and responsibility"" (A/55/270 of 3 August 2000), there have been continuing efforts to strengthen accountability at the United Nations. However, the Secretariat is now facing an unprecedented series of organizational challenges which have exposed shortcomings in the way it conducts its business. The Secretary-General is therefore taking additional actions where it is within his authority to do so, particularly in the critical areas of the accountability framework, oversight, ethics and transparency. 3. This report is organized into six parts covering the following headings: measures for strengthening the accountability framework; assessment of experiences with audit committees; establishment of oversight mechanisms; ensuring ethical conduct; enhancing transparency; and timely implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies. II. Measures to strengthen the accountability framework 4. The accountability framework at the United Nations is based on a hierarchy headed by the General Assembly that flows through the Secretary-General, senior managers and middle management to all other staff. Annex I to this report provides a schematic representation of this structure and the mechanisms that support it. At each level in the hierarchy, it is essential that there be clearly defined responsibilities and performance expectations and that there be mechanisms in place that enable both routine and formal assessment of performance. The measures described in the present section of this report are aimed at ensuring that: (a) the Secretary-General receives the necessary advice to properly assess the performance of senior managers; (b) executive-level decisions are clearly understood and followed up; (c) senior managers understand what is expected from them; and (d) the mechanism for formal appraisal of all staff, including managers, is improved. A. Reconstituting of the Accountability Panel as the Management Performance Board 5. Through the promulgation of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/13, which took effect from 13 May 2005, the Secretary-General has replaced the 5 A/60/312 Accountability Panel with the Management Performance Board. The Board's terms of reference and responsibilities are clearer and better defined than those of the Panel. The Board will advise the Secretary-General on matters concerning the performance of individual senior managers. Its functions include reviewing the material recommendations of the Oversight Committee (see sect. IV of this report) and ensuring that managers act on serious managerial issues identified by its oversight bodies. It will also monitor the manner in which senior managers exercise all aspects of the authority that has been delegated to them, including their performance in achieving the objectives contained in human resources action plans, and review the outcome of the administration of justice proceedings in the Secretariat for management accountability purposes. 6. The members of the Management Performance Board will be appointed by the Secretary-General for a two-year term, which may be renewable. Its membership will consist of a chairperson, who will be the Deputy Secretary-General, two members at the Under-Secretary-General level and an external expert in public sector management. 7. In July 2005, the Deputy Secretary-General chaired the first organizational meeting of the Management Performance Board, which conducted a review of existing sources of managerial performance data. The Department of Management was requested to review methods of performance assessments used in other comparable organizations, with a view to preparing proposals for a set of qualitative and quantitative performance indicators covering both programmatic and managerial functions that would enable a high-level evaluation of a senior manager's performance. The Board is expected to consider these proposals at its next meeting in the fourth quarter of 2005. B. Improving executive-level decision-making 8. Recognizing the value in having the ability to take high-level decisions on a timely basis and in an effort to ensure that mechanisms would be in place to hold senior management accountable for follow-up action, the Secretary-General established a Senior Management Group as part of his initial reform programme in 1997. The Group comprised all heads of Secretariat departments and United Nations offices, funds and programmes. As a result, coordination and coherence within the United Nations family have since been enhanced. In practice, however, while having real utility as an information-sharing body, the Group has proved too large for effective and timely decision-making. Consequently, two smaller senior-level committees, a Policy Committee and a Management Committee -- both chaired by the Secretary-General -- have been created. The modus operandi of these Committees will ensure clear expectations, and clear definition of responsibility and timelines for implementation. As of 30 June 2005, the Policy Committee had met on six occasions since its establishment in May 2005 and has presented the Secretary- General with policy options on a wide range of issues. The Management Committee held its first meeting on 20 May 2005 to review progress made to date on management reform and later met in July 2005 to endorse a number of reform proposals. 6 A/60/312 C. Introducing mandatory induction programmes for senior officials 9. A more robust approach to ensuring that senior officials are adequately informed on the broader system of United Nations regulations and rules, code of conduct and managerial systems is required. To meet this need, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations piloted its first induction session in June 2005 for a group of newly appointed leaders in a number of field missions. The programme, which is intended to be conducted biannually, will cover sessions on conduct and requirements for management performance. At the same time, a broader induction programme for senior-level recruits is being developed in the rest of the United Nations Secretariat. It is expected that this will be launched by the end of 2005. A consolidated reference guide on delegation of authority has been prepared and will act both as a training aid during the induction programmes and as a reference document designed to clarify the responsibilities that are delegated to senior officials. D. Defining performance expectations for programme delivery 10. An essential component of the accountability framework is the clear and meaningful measurement of programme delivery. To this end, as part of the Secretary-General's first round of reforms, results-based budgeting was introduced. A comprehensive set of performance indicators for all programmes, including peacekeeping missions, have now been developed. For the programme budget for 2004-2005 and the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007, performance measures, namely, baselines and targets, have also been included. 11. To gain maximum benefit from these performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation are being enhanced. The Office of Internal Oversight Services presented its latest recommendations on this subject to the General Assembly in its reports on strengthening the role of evaluation findings in programme design, delivery and policy directives (see A/59/79) and further specific proposals (which were prepared jointly with the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU)) on the strengthening and monitoring of programme  performance  and  evaluation  (A/60/73).  The  measures  being implemented will include improvements in data-collection and monitoring systems and strengthening of self-evaluation. Programme managers are required to include in their budget proposals for the biennium 2006-2007 adequate resources to effectively evaluate their programme performance. 12. The improvements in monitoring and evaluation combined with the performance indicators contained in the biennial programme plan and the programme budget will provide the basis for objective reporting of performance both to Member States through the programme performance report and to the new Management Performance Board. These inputs, together with the independent inspection and evaluation reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU, will put the Board in a position to provide the Secretary-General with the advice he needs to hold his senior managers accountable for the results they achieve in delivering their work programmes. 7 A/60/312 E. Enhancing the Performance Appraisal System 13. As part of the overall accountability framework, the e-PAS is the formal tool employed in holding staff accountable for their performance. The system has the basic objective of creating a fair, equitable, transparent and measurable system of performance management in support of a results-based culture that recognizes and rewards excellent performance while adequately addressing underperformance. The system applies to all staff and managers except the heads of departments who are currently subject to annual assessment through their programme management plans. The e-PAS represents an enhancement of the original Performance Appraisal System (PAS), and was introduced after extensive consultations throughout the Secretariat. Incorporated into the revised e-PAS system are the following features: (a) The organizational core values and competencies, in order to provide a fuller picture of performance; (b) Self-assessment by staff members; (c) The managerial competencies for supervisory staff so as to provide an assessment of their supervisory skills; (d) Strengthened links between performance management and career development; (e) Enhanced accountability measures such as the inclusion of an optional section in the e-PAS for the comments of staff on supervision received. F. Requiring personal financial liability of staff 14. The Secretary-General has defined the conditions, through staff rules 112.3, 212.2 and 312.2, under which staff members may be required to reimburse the United Nations, either partially or in full, for any financial loss suffered by the Organization as a result of the staff member's gross negligence or violation of the regulations and procedures. To that end, administrative instruction ST/AI/2004/3 of 29 September 2004 was promulgated. The instructions also define the conditions for implementing financial rule 101.2, under which any staff member who violates the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) or corresponding administrative instructions, may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions. III. Assessment of experience with audit and oversight committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations 15. At its fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly, in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/264 A, having taken note of the Secretariat's effort in collecting information on the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, requested the Secretary-General to report on and provide an assessment of its findings to the Assembly at its sixtieth session. 8 A/60/312 16. The Secretariat collected the information on audit committees during 2004. Thirty-three organizations were involved, grouped in four categories: specialized agencies and related organizations; funds and programmes; multinational financial institutions; and other international organizations. The Secretariat's analysis revealed that 60 per cent of the organizations involved in the survey had already established an oversight mechanism (see annex II). These oversight mechanisms were referred to as either audit committees or oversight committees. It is worth noting that even the organizations that do not have an institutionalized audit committee have set up mechanisms to review internal and external audit matters as well as progress made in implementing audit recommendations. In some of these cases, it is the relevant programme and budget committee that plays this role. 17. When considering the role of the audit committees within an organization, it is important to recognize the distinction between the committees that operate as advisory panels to either the respective executive heads or the executive boards and those that are part of the governing body of the organization. The latter is the case in most of the multinational financial institutions like the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 18. The responsibilities of the oversight committees generally include: (a) Reviewing the strategy and workplans of internal and, in some organizations, external audit; and discussing the scope and content of their audits so as to identify audit priorities and suggesting potential audit areas within which to address the organization's risks; (b) Reviewing the findings and recommendations emanating from the reports, inspection and investigations, including those on irregularities and fraud; (c) Ensuring that appropriate and timely actions are taken by the management in implementing the recommendations of the internal and external oversight bodies and monitoring follow-up action thereon. 19. In addition, other responsibilities of some of the committees include: (a) Assessing the integrity of the financial statements of the organizations and their accounting, financial reporting and disclosure policies and practices; (b) Reviewing risk management and the internal control system; (c) Making recommendations with regard to the appointments and tenure of members of the external board of auditors; (d) Assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of internal and external audit services; (e) Providing an open avenue of communication between the governing board, management and the functions of internal and external audit; (f) Serving as an issue resolution forum in cases where there are differences in respect of opinions or recommendations between managers and auditors or investigators, or among the auditors themselves; (g) Promoting an organization-wide culture that accepts the importance and value of the internal audit, inspection and investigation functions and providing 9 A/60/312 executive heads with the assurance that these functions are operating effectively and efficiently. Composition 20. In general, the membership of the committees ranges from six to nine members, primarily high-ranking or senior management officers. However, external (United Nations or non-United Nations) members are strategically included either because of their present position as is the case at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) or because of their professional qualifications, expertise and/or competence as is the case at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). External members usually serve for a two-year renewable term. Meetings 21. The committees generally meet up to four times per annum. However the chairperson in most cases possesses the discretionary authority to call additional meetings if deemed appropriate, for example, to initiate discussion of emerging audit matters. The executive head in some instances can also request that the chairperson convene a meeting. Reporting 22. The committees generally report to either the executive head or to the governing body (for example, the executive council). It is worth noting that the committees within the United Nations system generally report to their executive heads, while the committees within the multinational financial institutions and other international organizations report to their executive boards. IV. Strengthening of the oversight mechanisms 23. Independent oversight is an essential part of any comprehensive system of accountability. At the United Nations, there are three main bodies that provide this function, namely, the Board of Auditors, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU. Without the audit of financial statements, the investigation of complaints, the evaluation of programme performance, and all the other reviews carried out by these bodies, both internal management and the governing bodies would not have an impartial assessment of the functioning of the Organization or, where shortcomings are identified, be in a position to hold accountable those responsible. It is therefore essential that the oversight bodies be independent, have the capacity to carry out their functions, and provide full coverage of all aspects of the functioning of the Organization. It is also essential that effective follow-up action be taken on the basis of their findings, including implementation of recommendations and analysis of their reports, to address systemic weaknesses. The measures described in the present section of this report address these issues. 10 A/60/312 A. Establishment of the United Nations Oversight Committee 24. As has been described in section III of this report, the Secretariat initiated a review of audit committees in order to establish a similar body at the United Nations. Pursuant to the initiation of this review, the General Assembly, in resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, requested the establishment of a high-level follow-up mechanism under the authority of the Secretary-General to effectively feed findings and recommendations of the oversight bodies into the executive management processes. 25. Utilizing the findings of the Secretariat's review, terms of reference for a United Nations Oversight Committee have been prepared and are ready for issuance. The Oversight Committee will function as an independent advisory panel to the Secretary-General. Its objectives include ensuring the systematic implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies; sharing audit-related information and lessons learned within the Secretariat, where appropriate; and ensuring that significant risks to the Organization are identified and mitigating measures taken. Its responsibilities will include: (a) Ensuring that appropriate and timely action is taken by the relevant managers to rectify problems in areas of concern identified by oversight bodies, and to effectively manage risks within the organization; (b) Alerting the Secretary-General on systemic organizational issues that may arise from audit, investigation or evaluation reports, and making recommendations as appropriate; (c) On behalf of the Secretary-General, providing advice and suggestions on the priorities, long-term strategy and annual audit workplans of oversight bodies and requesting that significant risks identified be included in such workplans; (d) Preparing the Secretary-General's response to reports of oversight bodies submitted to the General Assembly, taking into account the input provided by the departments or offices concerned; (e) Rendering advice on audit related-matters to the Secretary-General and departmental heads as it deems appropriate; (f) Encouraging and facilitating, if necessary, collaboration and cooperation among the various oversight bodies. 26. The Secretary-General will appoint a Chairperson and three additional members to the Committee. The Chairperson and two of the members will be senior Secretariat officials at a rank no lower than that of Assistant Secretary-General. The other member will be external to the Secretariat. Members of the Committee shall serve for a period of two years, renewable once, with the renewal period phased so as to provide continuity. Committee members shall act in an independent capacity while performing their advisory role on the Committee. The Committee shall meet at the request of the Chairperson or any member as required but no less than once every calendar quarter. The Under-Secretary-General for Management will attend meetings in an ex officio capacity. 27. The Committee is required to produce an annual report on its work for the previous year, which will be presented to the Secretary-General during the first calendar quarter of each year. The Committee will also contribute to the annual 11 A/60/312 report to the General Assembly on measures taken to improve accountability in the Secretariat. 28. It should be noted that some of the functions identified during the review of the audit committees of other organizations have not been included in the terms of reference  of  the  Oversight  Committee.  These  would  include  making recommendations on the resource requirements of the various oversight bodies; assessment of the efforts of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Board of Auditors and JIU to strengthen the Organization's internal controls; and the identification of possible gaps in the United Nations oversight coverage. It is considered that these functions would not be appropriately discharged by a committee reporting directly to the Secretary-General. However, additional strengthening of United Nations oversight is currently under discussion in the General Assembly. B. Enhancement of fraud and corruption prevention mechanisms 29. In paragraph 349 of volume I of the report of the Board of Auditors (A/59/5 (vol. I), chap. I), the Board recommended, inter alia, that the Administration: (a) Implement a comprehensive and well-communicated corruption and fraud prevention plan in the United Nations system; (b) Establish a corruption and fraud prevention committee that would serve as an effective framework and coordination point for a United Nations system corruption and fraud prevention mechanism; (c) Conduct ethics, corruption and fraud awareness training sessions and workshops among managers, international and local employees and other stakeholders; (d) Develop appropriate resolution mechanisms for reported and detected incidents and allegations of corruption and fraud. A clarification was obtained from the Board that the word ""system"" mentioned in its recommendation referred to the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 30. The United Nations already has in place many rules, procedures and controls designed to prevent fraud and corruption. However, based on the Board's recommendation, new efforts have been initiated to draw a more comprehensive plan, addressing all aspects of corruption and fraud prevention. To that end, a working group has been established to propose such a plan. As a first step, the working group is drawing up an anti-corruption and fraud prevention policy which will draw on existing best practices, including the model recently developed by the World Bank. 31. The working group will also propose an effective mechanism through which to coordinate the efforts on corruption and fraud prevention of the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 32. A training programme will be part of the overall corruption and fraud prevention plan. It will include general awareness training, as well as specific modules for functions where the risk of fraud and corruption is higher. The programme will address staff at all levels of the Organization. 12 A/60/312 C. Efforts to strengthen the Office of Internal Oversight Services 33. The Office of Internal Oversight Services in its tenth annual report to the General Assembly (see A/59/359) provided the results of its own self-evaluation to assist the Assembly in carrying out its review and evaluation of the Office in 2004. The self-evaluation exercise looked at strengths and weaknesses and pointed to areas where the Office could be improved. In addition, in his note transmitting the annual report to the Assembly, the Secretary-General recommended to the Assembly that the Office undergo a comprehensive external review in order to strengthen its capacity to carry out all aspects of its work. That recommendation was reiterated in paragraph 192 of the Secretary-General's report entitled ""In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all"" (A/59/2005). 34. The General Assembly in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/272 affirmed that any external review of the Office of Internal Oversight Services could be undertaken only by such bodies as the Board of Auditors or JIU, or those mandated to do so by the Assembly. It is recommended that the scope of such a review should include the investigation processes at offices away from Headquarters as recommended by the Board. 35. Apart from any external review that may be undertaken as a result of the Secretary-General's proposals above, measures have already been taken to strengthen the investigation function of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. In resolution 59/287 of 13 April 2005, the General Assembly re-emphasized that the Office was the internal body entrusted with investigation in the United Nations and therefore decided that the results of all preliminary investigations conducted by programme managers should be reported to the Office. Pursuant to the adoption of this resolution, the Office now has independent, residual and exclusive authority to investigate the most serious cases (all ""category one"" cases, that is to say, all high- risk, complex matters and serious criminal cases). An added layer of oversight determines that the Office must be informed of the results of all ""category two"" cases (cases of lower risk to the Organization) investigated by programme managers, so that the Office can have an overview of all matters that have been investigated by the Organization. D. Review of governance structures and the format of accountability reports 36. The way in which financial reports and reports of oversight bodies are considered and acted upon represents an essential part of the accountability process. Recognizing this, the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 57/278 A of 20 December 2002 (later reaffirmed in resolution 59/264 A) requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to examine governance structures, principles and accountability throughout the United Nations system and to make proposals on the future format and consideration of the reports of the Board of Auditors by the respective executive boards and the Assembly. The matter was taken up and discussed by the High-level Committee on Management (HLCM) at its eighth session, held in Rome on 5 and 6 October 2004. At that session, the Committee decided that, in the first instance, this item should be carried forward by the Finance and Budget Network, in particular as regards format and consideration of the reports of the Board of 13 A/60/312 Auditors, and requested that the secretariat of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) carry out consultations with the Board of Auditors and obtain more detailed information on the scope and objectives of this review (see CEB/2004/6, para. 60). Member States are currently seized with the subject of strengthening governance arrangements in the context of the discussions on the outcome document for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the Assembly. 37. Related to this subject is the recommendation of the Board of Auditors that covered the issue of governance principles and best practices related to financial reporting. It pointed out that in its view, the following governance issues were normally reported on in a medium such as the financial report that preceded the financial statements: (a) governance and other regulatory bodies; (b) performance reporting and non-financial information; (c) social accounting issues; and (d) risk management, continuity and internal control (A/59/5/Add.2, chap. II, para. 25). 38. At its ninth session held at Geneva in April 2005, the High-level Committee on Management decided to set up a working group to examine current accountability mechanisms in organizations, to raise awareness of such tools and to identify best practices (see CEB/2005/3, para. 22 (f)). It was recognized that this issue was very broad and was related to overall organizational culture and not just audit processes (ibid., para. 21). Therefore, the working group will comprise representatives of budget, finance and human resources management. The terms of reference of this working group will, inter alia, include addressing the resolutions and recommendations referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 above. V. Ensuring ethical conduct 39. The commitment to the highest ethical standards at the United Nations is a core value and fundamental guiding principle in ensuring that the Organization achieves its mission. In response to the findings of a Secretariat-wide staff survey, the probes into the management of the oil-for-food programme and the allegations of sexual misconduct in various peace missions, the United Nations has begun implementing additional measures to address deficiencies and ensure a culture of ethical conduct. A. Proposed establishment of the United Nations Office of Ethics 40. Underlying the main effort of the Secretariat in that regard is the proposal for the establishment of an independent Office of Ethics, the head of which will report directly to the Secretary-General. The objective of the Office will be to assist the Organization in maintaining the highest standards of integrity, as required by the Charter of the United Nations and thereby maintain and enhance international confidence in the United Nations through fostering a culture of ethical conduct, transparency and accountability, setting and disseminating standards for appropriate professional conduct and providing leadership, management and oversight of the United Nations ethics infrastructure. Proposals for the establishment of the Office of Ethics, along with its terms of reference, are currently under preparation for the consideration of the General Assembly. 14 A/60/312 B. Financial disclosure by senior officials 41. In July 2005, the Secretary-General decided to broaden the scope of financial disclosure, as currently required of senior officials, including those employed on a short-term basis or under special conditions. This followed a review of disclosure practices in comparable organizations. The appropriate mechanisms for monitoring these disclosures are also under review for immediate strengthening. It is envisaged that the scope of annual financial disclosure and declaration of interest will be broadened from the Assistant Secretary-General/Under-Secretary-General level to include all staff at the D-1 level and above. The financial disclosure threshold levels will be lowered for assets and income from $25,000 to $10,000 and for gifts from $10,000 to $250. 42. The financial disclosure programme will be administered by the proposed Office of Ethics, pursuant to its establishment. The implementation of the expanded financial disclosure regime will require an amendment of staff regulation 1.2 (n) by the General Assembly. C. Protection against retaliation for exposure of wrongdoing or reporting of irregularities and misconduct 43. The Secretary-General is finalizing a comprehensive policy to ensure protection against retaliation for reporting of alleged misconduct. This policy will complement existing administrative issuances concerning avenues for the reporting of alleged misconduct that are set out in information circular ST/IC/2005/19. It is essential that staff have confidence in these mechanisms and assurance that the appropriate level of protection is provided. For this reason, additional rounds of consultation with the staff have been conducted on the terms of the new policy. D. Enhancement of codes of conduct and conflict-of-interest rules 44. While the United Nations has in place a detailed Code of Conduct readily available to all staff on the Intranet, it is now planned to disseminate the Code in other ways. The Secretary-General has commissioned the design of a user-friendly orientation and information booklet for distribution in the latter part of 2005 to all staff based on the Secretary-General's bulletin on the status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members (ST/SGB/2002/13). Special additional rules are also being developed for staff engaged in procurement activities. In this respect, a Declaration of Independence to be signed by all staff members working in the procurement process has been prepared and an administrative issuance on rules governing the conduct of staff engaged in procurement activities is being finalized for adoption by the Secretary-General. A United Nations Supplier Code of Conduct is also being formulated. It is expected that all these materials will be produced and ready for dissemination in the near future. 45. The Office of Ethics, once established, will be responsible for standard-setting on ethics issues and training, in coordination with the Office of Human Resources Management. 15 A/60/312 E. Incorporation of ethics into staff training programmes 46. Staff will be required to complete a new downloadable content module on integrity and ethics provisions for self-training that has now been completed in the form of a CD-ROM. In addition, ethics modules have been incorporated into all existing training programmes for United Nations staff, including at induction, and the Career Resources Centre (CRC) offers a lunchtime programme on ethics. It is envisaged that both the CD-ROM on integrity and the Career Resources Centre ethics programme will be mandatory for all staff. F. Protection against harassment in the workplace 47. While the United Nations has a zero tolerance sexual harassment policy in place, the Secretary-General is in the process of formulating a new, broader policy to encompass other forms of harassment. This will be introduced following consultation with the staff representative bodies. The United Nations Secretariat has also joined the United Nations Development Group in the development and implementation of an online learning programme on harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority, which, once available, will be mandatory for all staff. G. Response to allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by field personnel 48. In addition to the efforts in place for dealing with the issues of harassment and sexual misconduct, in response to the widespread allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse at some United Nations peacekeeping operations, there has been aggressive pursuit by the Organization of such cases. As of July 2005, across all peacekeeping operations, 186 peacekeepers had been investigated for sexual exploitation and abuse; 7 United Nations civilians had been summarily dismissed; and 80 members of military contingents had been expelled from the field missions. Investigations into such allegations are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Haiti in particular. Additionally, a number of short- and medium-term initiatives are under way, including: (a) The introduction of a unified standard of conduct across all categories of peacekeeping personnel. Mandatory training on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse has been integrated into all mission induction programmes. Improved complaint mechanisms have been established in all missions, including telephone hotlines and a network of Focal Points for Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, who receive complaints in person. In addition, missions are ensuring that victims of sexual abuse are referred to existing emergency assistance (medical, psychosocial, legal) in the mission area; (b) A global review of the state of discipline in peacekeeping operations conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the results of which are currently being analysed; (c) The establishment by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of a Conduct and Discipline Unit at United Nations Headquarters. Over the coming months, similar capacity will be created in eight Department of Peacekeeping 16 A/60/312 Operations missions. The Units will focus on preventing misconduct through various means, including awareness-raising and training and improving welfare and recreation facilities. Other key activities of such Units will include tracking data on misconduct cases for all categories of peacekeeping personnel and developing measures to ensure compliance with United Nations standards of conduct, such as the establishment of lists of premises considered out of bounds for United Nations personnel. Such Units will work with in-country networks on sexual exploitation and abuse, developed to better coordinate and share information on this problem; (d) The approval by the General Assembly in June 2005 of 19 new Office of Internal Oversight Services investigator positions, as well as additional investigative resources for following up allegations of misconduct in peacekeeping missions. 49. In the longer term, a comprehensive review will be undertaken of the welfare and recreation needs of all peacekeeping personnel, as well as the development of a comprehensive strategy for victim assistance. New agreements with troop- contributing countries and United Nations partners will be developed. In addition, a group of legal experts will be examining ways to ensure that United Nations staff and experts on mission are held responsible for criminal acts committed in countries where no functioning judicial system exists. H. Dissemination of information concerning the Secretary-General's decisions in disciplinary matters 50. Starting  in  2002,  two  information  circulars  (ST/IC/2002/25  and ST/IC/2004/28) were issued that informed all staff of the Secretary-General's practice in disciplinary matters. It is expected that the sharing of information with staff members concerning decisions on disciplinary cases will not only raise awareness and enhance transparency in disciplinary matters, but also have a deterrent effect and thus enhance ethical conduct. VI. Enhancing transparency 51. Transparency is an essential feature of any system of accountability. By making decision-making processes, performance data, transaction processing, and general information about the Organization more accessible, the United Nations becomes more accountable to Member States, staff and civil society. A major vehicle for improving transparency has been Internet technology, and the United Nations home page has been enhanced during the last few years to become a strategic communication tool. Efforts are also ongoing to increase awareness inside the United Nations of Intranet capabilities, and build on existing features, such as the Procurement and Facilities Management tracking systems, that give transparency to administrative processes. In addition to the continuous expansion of the Intranet, Extranet and Internet, there are other measures aimed at improving the openness of the operation of the United Nations, which are described below. 17 A/60/312 A. Access to United Nations information 52. The Secretary-General has initiated an assessment of best practices in public administrations around the world and examined various models of information access in different countries in developing a clear and consistent policy for determining which United Nations documents should be accessible outside the Secretariat. In the latter part of 2005, the Management Committee will review this comprehensive assessment and will provide guidance for a new policy. It should be noted that access to United Nations documentation that is neither restricted nor confidential is now freely available on the Internet through the Official Document System. B. Selection and appointment of senior officials 53. In order to enhance transparency in the appointment of senior officials, the Secretary-General has put in place a new selection process which ensures a much wider search for qualified candidates and allows for a rigorous, open process against predetermined criteria for all senior United Nations officials and heads of United Nations funds and programmes. As part of the new mechanism, the Senior Appointment Group (SAG) reviews candidatures for appointment by the Secretary- General. The Chef de Cabinet then constitutes an interview panel with a minimum of four members of the Group. The names of two or more finalists are then submitted to the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General for final consideration. 54. In the case of senior appointments that involve intergovernmental bodies in the appointment process (for example, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the Office of Internal Oversight Services), shortlists are drawn up from a list of nominations submitted in response to a request for such nomination by the Secretary-General addressed to Members States and relevant institutions. Shortlists would also be developed through a more informal process of outreach and search. In the case of Secretariat appointments of a specialized nature, an outside technical expert may be invited to be part of the relevant interview panel. In all cases, clear job descriptions and required competencies will have been developed against which candidates can be judged. A more systematic process of vetting and reference-checking of candidates will be instituted, with external assistance whenever necessary. The Secretary-General will in all cases have the ultimate authority to make the final selection, taking into account other factors, such as geographical distribution and gender balance. Since the establishment of this new procedure, several senior-level posts have been filled via the new system, including those of UNDP, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and UNHCR. C. Senior Review Group 55. The Secretary-General has constituted a Senior Review Group as a standing advisory body to make recommendations to the Secretary-General on appointment and promotion to posts at the D-2 level. For the purpose of defining the terms of 18 A/60/312 reference of the Group, Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/4 was promulgated on 28 February 2005 and the membership of the Group was presented in information circular ST/IC/2005/33 of 1 July 2005. In accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the Secretary-General's bulletin, all appointments to this body are made by the Secretary-General. According to section 3, all D-2 vacancy announcements, except for vacant posts in the Executive Office of the Secretary- General and for the special envoys, are to be circulated. D. External validation of the procurement system 56. The Volcker Inquiry was critical of various United Nations procurement cases in the early years of the oil-for-food programme. However, since the mid-1990s, a major overhaul of the United Nations procurement process has been undertaken, making it more transparent and addressing any shortcomings identified in a number of different reviews. In the light of issues raised by the Volcker Inquiry, the Secretary-General commissioned a review, completed in June 2005, that compared existing procurement rules and regulations with the best global practices of outside organizations and companies in order to ensure that the improvements introduced since the mid to late 1990s met the highest global standards. In addition, in August 2005, the Secretary-General commissioned a full financial and internal control review of the United Nations current procurement system. 57. The June 2005 review evaluated positively the transparency achieved by the United Nations Procurement Service website. The review stated that the Service website (http://www.un.org/Depts/ptd) was an extensive, well-designed site with current information directly relevant to the needs of prospective and active suppliers and that the transparent and open approach of the Service to sourcing and vendor development was directly in line with that of leading public procurement agencies. E. Accounting standards 58. The adoption of clear standards for accounting purposes is essential for transparent financial reporting. The High Level Committee on Management has approved a project for the development of such accounting standards within the United Nations system. This project is being undertaken by a Task Force under the auspices of the Committee's Finance and Budget Network. Possible standards have been identified and final proposals will be submitted by the Task Force to the Finance and Budget Network for approval prior to their presentation to the Committee for endorsement. VII. Time frames for implementation of the recommendations of the oversight bodies 59. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 59/264 A, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to indicate expected time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors, including the office-holders to be held accountable. A similar request was later reiterated in paragraph 6 of resolution 264 B; and in paragraph 7 of the same resolution, the Secretary-General 19 A/60/312 was further requested to provide an assessment to the Assembly at its sixtieth session on the progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of recommendations of the Board. 60. As per annex III of the present report, approximately 73 per cent of the recommendations addressed to the United Nations, and reported as outstanding to the Board of Auditors as at the end of June 2004, had time frames assigned for implementation. For the United Nations University (UNU), the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, time frames were provided in 82 per cent, 50 per cent, 40 per cent and 47 per cent of cases, respectively. For all four organizations, the office-holders responsible for implementation were clearly identified for all outstanding recommendations. The progress towards proper assignment of time frames was acknowledged by the Board in paragraph 1 (a) of its current report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session on the status of implementation of its recommendations relating to the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex). 61. Owing to the high priority given to the implementation of all the approved recommendations of the Board of Auditors and the other oversight bodies, efforts have been intensified by the Secretariat to ensure that the recommendations of the other oversight bodies, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU also have responsible  office-holders  assigned  and  time  frames  defined  for  their implementation. The Oversight Committee will have an overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with these requirements. 62. Overall progress is being made towards improving implementation rates. The Board of Auditors was pleased to note that the overall proportion of implementation of 34 per cent of the previous biennium had increased to 46 per cent in the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex, para. 9). VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 63. This report describes the measures taken by the Secretary-General to strengthen the system of accountability at the United Nations. In formulating these measures, the Secretary-General has taken into account the need for: (a) the clear definition of authority and results to be achieved; (b) the establishment of appropriate support and guidance mechanisms; (c) the strengthening of systems to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of performance; and (d) the provision of follow-up mechanisms that lead to appropriate recognition of both good and unsatisfactory performance, and investigations and appropriate corrective action if necessary. 64. Many of the measures described, such as the establishment of the Management Performance Board and the proposed establishment of the Office of Ethics, will themselves lead to a further examination of the way that the United Nations 20 A/60/312 conducts its business and to additional measures to improve the system of accountability. Together with those already described in this report, they will help achieve the goal of ensuring that programme managers and staff are held accountable for the effective delivery of their work and the way they conduct themselves, and that both management and staff operate in an open and transparent environment, free from unethical conduct. 65. The General Assembly may wish to take note of this report, including of the fact that new elements are being added to the accountability framework that will strengthen accountability in the Secretariat. 21 A/60/312 Annex I The accountability framework Responsibility and authority Accountability Mechanism       Charter of the United Nations General Assembly and other intergovernmental bodies Provide mandates and overall policy guidance to the Secretary-General for the execution of these mandates as well as those given to the Secretary-General directly by the Charter of the United Nations.

The report comes at a time when the United Nations has faced an unprecedented series of organizational challenges. In response to these challenges, the Secretary-General has revisited the existing mechanisms of accountability and oversight and developed a set of measures based on three main pillars, namely, accountability; transparency; and ethics. The report outlines these new measures, and others that were already initiated, and presents them under the following thematic headings: measures for strengthening the accountability framework; strengthening the oversight mechanisms; ensuring ethical conduct; enhancing transparency; and other measures. In addition, the report responds to two other requests of the General Assembly, as contained in its resolutions 59/264 A of 23 December 2004 and 59/264 B of 22 June 2005, namely: to report, respectively, on (a) an analysis of experiences with audit committees derived from a review conducted by the Secretariat; and (b) progress made on indicating time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of oversight bodies, both of which are an integral part of the measures being taken to improve accountability. * A/60/150. ** Owing to extensive consultations, submission of the present report was delayed. 2 A/60/312 Contents Paragraphs Page   I.

Introduction 1. The present report has been submitted pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, in which the Assembly mandated the Secretary-General to submit annually to the Assembly a report under the agenda item entitled ""Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations"" addressing the measures aimed at strengthening accountability in the Secretariat. This report also responds to paragraph 11 of resolution 59/264 A of 23 December 2004 and paragraph 7 of resolution 59/264 B of 22 June 2005, in which the Assembly called, respectively, for an assessment of the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, and an assessment of progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors. 2. Since the submission to the General Assembly of the last report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Accountability and responsibility"" (A/55/270 of 3 August 2000), there have been continuing efforts to strengthen accountability at the United Nations. However, the Secretariat is now facing an unprecedented series of organizational challenges which have exposed shortcomings in the way it conducts its business. The Secretary-General is therefore taking additional actions where it is within his authority to do so, particularly in the critical areas of the accountability framework, oversight, ethics and transparency. 3. This report is organized into six parts covering the following headings: measures for strengthening the accountability framework; assessment of experiences with audit committees; establishment of oversight mechanisms; ensuring ethical conduct; enhancing transparency; and timely implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies. II. Measures to strengthen the accountability framework 4. The accountability framework at the United Nations is based on a hierarchy headed by the General Assembly that flows through the Secretary-General, senior managers and middle management to all other staff. Annex I to this report provides a schematic representation of this structure and the mechanisms that support it. At each level in the hierarchy, it is essential that there be clearly defined responsibilities and performance expectations and that there be mechanisms in place that enable both routine and formal assessment of performance. The measures described in the present section of this report are aimed at ensuring that: (a) the Secretary-General receives the necessary advice to properly assess the performance of senior managers; (b) executive-level decisions are clearly understood and followed up; (c) senior managers understand what is expected from them; and (d) the mechanism for formal appraisal of all staff, including managers, is improved. A. Reconstituting of the Accountability Panel as the Management Performance Board 5. Through the promulgation of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/13, which took effect from 13 May 2005, the Secretary-General has replaced the 5 A/60/312 Accountability Panel with the Management Performance Board. The Board's terms of reference and responsibilities are clearer and better defined than those of the Panel. The Board will advise the Secretary-General on matters concerning the performance of individual senior managers. Its functions include reviewing the material recommendations of the Oversight Committee (see sect. IV of this report) and ensuring that managers act on serious managerial issues identified by its oversight bodies. It will also monitor the manner in which senior managers exercise all aspects of the authority that has been delegated to them, including their performance in achieving the objectives contained in human resources action plans, and review the outcome of the administration of justice proceedings in the Secretariat for management accountability purposes. 6. The members of the Management Performance Board will be appointed by the Secretary-General for a two-year term, which may be renewable. Its membership will consist of a chairperson, who will be the Deputy Secretary-General, two members at the Under-Secretary-General level and an external expert in public sector management. 7. In July 2005, the Deputy Secretary-General chaired the first organizational meeting of the Management Performance Board, which conducted a review of existing sources of managerial performance data. The Department of Management was requested to review methods of performance assessments used in other comparable organizations, with a view to preparing proposals for a set of qualitative and quantitative performance indicators covering both programmatic and managerial functions that would enable a high-level evaluation of a senior manager's performance. The Board is expected to consider these proposals at its next meeting in the fourth quarter of 2005. B. Improving executive-level decision-making 8. Recognizing the value in having the ability to take high-level decisions on a timely basis and in an effort to ensure that mechanisms would be in place to hold senior management accountable for follow-up action, the Secretary-General established a Senior Management Group as part of his initial reform programme in 1997. The Group comprised all heads of Secretariat departments and United Nations offices, funds and programmes. As a result, coordination and coherence within the United Nations family have since been enhanced. In practice, however, while having real utility as an information-sharing body, the Group has proved too large for effective and timely decision-making. Consequently, two smaller senior-level committees, a Policy Committee and a Management Committee -- both chaired by the Secretary-General -- have been created. The modus operandi of these Committees will ensure clear expectations, and clear definition of responsibility and timelines for implementation. As of 30 June 2005, the Policy Committee had met on six occasions since its establishment in May 2005 and has presented the Secretary- General with policy options on a wide range of issues. The Management Committee held its first meeting on 20 May 2005 to review progress made to date on management reform and later met in July 2005 to endorse a number of reform proposals. 6 A/60/312 C. Introducing mandatory induction programmes for senior officials 9. A more robust approach to ensuring that senior officials are adequately informed on the broader system of United Nations regulations and rules, code of conduct and managerial systems is required. To meet this need, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations piloted its first induction session in June 2005 for a group of newly appointed leaders in a number of field missions. The programme, which is intended to be conducted biannually, will cover sessions on conduct and requirements for management performance. At the same time, a broader induction programme for senior-level recruits is being developed in the rest of the United Nations Secretariat. It is expected that this will be launched by the end of 2005. A consolidated reference guide on delegation of authority has been prepared and will act both as a training aid during the induction programmes and as a reference document designed to clarify the responsibilities that are delegated to senior officials. D. Defining performance expectations for programme delivery 10. An essential component of the accountability framework is the clear and meaningful measurement of programme delivery. To this end, as part of the Secretary-General's first round of reforms, results-based budgeting was introduced. A comprehensive set of performance indicators for all programmes, including peacekeeping missions, have now been developed. For the programme budget for 2004-2005 and the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007, performance measures, namely, baselines and targets, have also been included. 11. To gain maximum benefit from these performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation are being enhanced. The Office of Internal Oversight Services presented its latest recommendations on this subject to the General Assembly in its reports on strengthening the role of evaluation findings in programme design, delivery and policy directives (see A/59/79) and further specific proposals (which were prepared jointly with the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU)) on the strengthening and monitoring of programme  performance  and  evaluation  (A/60/73).  The  measures  being implemented will include improvements in data-collection and monitoring systems and strengthening of self-evaluation. Programme managers are required to include in their budget proposals for the biennium 2006-2007 adequate resources to effectively evaluate their programme performance. 12. The improvements in monitoring and evaluation combined with the performance indicators contained in the biennial programme plan and the programme budget will provide the basis for objective reporting of performance both to Member States through the programme performance report and to the new Management Performance Board. These inputs, together with the independent inspection and evaluation reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU, will put the Board in a position to provide the Secretary-General with the advice he needs to hold his senior managers accountable for the results they achieve in delivering their work programmes. 7 A/60/312 E. Enhancing the Performance Appraisal System 13. As part of the overall accountability framework, the e-PAS is the formal tool employed in holding staff accountable for their performance. The system has the basic objective of creating a fair, equitable, transparent and measurable system of performance management in support of a results-based culture that recognizes and rewards excellent performance while adequately addressing underperformance. The system applies to all staff and managers except the heads of departments who are currently subject to annual assessment through their programme management plans. The e-PAS represents an enhancement of the original Performance Appraisal System (PAS), and was introduced after extensive consultations throughout the Secretariat. Incorporated into the revised e-PAS system are the following features: (a) The organizational core values and competencies, in order to provide a fuller picture of performance; (b) Self-assessment by staff members; (c) The managerial competencies for supervisory staff so as to provide an assessment of their supervisory skills; (d) Strengthened links between performance management and career development; (e) Enhanced accountability measures such as the inclusion of an optional section in the e-PAS for the comments of staff on supervision received. F. Requiring personal financial liability of staff 14. The Secretary-General has defined the conditions, through staff rules 112.3, 212.2 and 312.2, under which staff members may be required to reimburse the United Nations, either partially or in full, for any financial loss suffered by the Organization as a result of the staff member's gross negligence or violation of the regulations and procedures. To that end, administrative instruction ST/AI/2004/3 of 29 September 2004 was promulgated. The instructions also define the conditions for implementing financial rule 101.2, under which any staff member who violates the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) or corresponding administrative instructions, may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions. III. Assessment of experience with audit and oversight committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations 15. At its fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly, in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/264 A, having taken note of the Secretariat's effort in collecting information on the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, requested the Secretary-General to report on and provide an assessment of its findings to the Assembly at its sixtieth session. 8 A/60/312 16. The Secretariat collected the information on audit committees during 2004. Thirty-three organizations were involved, grouped in four categories: specialized agencies and related organizations; funds and programmes; multinational financial institutions; and other international organizations. The Secretariat's analysis revealed that 60 per cent of the organizations involved in the survey had already established an oversight mechanism (see annex II). These oversight mechanisms were referred to as either audit committees or oversight committees. It is worth noting that even the organizations that do not have an institutionalized audit committee have set up mechanisms to review internal and external audit matters as well as progress made in implementing audit recommendations. In some of these cases, it is the relevant programme and budget committee that plays this role. 17. When considering the role of the audit committees within an organization, it is important to recognize the distinction between the committees that operate as advisory panels to either the respective executive heads or the executive boards and those that are part of the governing body of the organization. The latter is the case in most of the multinational financial institutions like the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 18. The responsibilities of the oversight committees generally include: (a) Reviewing the strategy and workplans of internal and, in some organizations, external audit; and discussing the scope and content of their audits so as to identify audit priorities and suggesting potential audit areas within which to address the organization's risks; (b) Reviewing the findings and recommendations emanating from the reports, inspection and investigations, including those on irregularities and fraud; (c) Ensuring that appropriate and timely actions are taken by the management in implementing the recommendations of the internal and external oversight bodies and monitoring follow-up action thereon. 19. In addition, other responsibilities of some of the committees include: (a) Assessing the integrity of the financial statements of the organizations and their accounting, financial reporting and disclosure policies and practices; (b) Reviewing risk management and the internal control system; (c) Making recommendations with regard to the appointments and tenure of members of the external board of auditors; (d) Assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of internal and external audit services; (e) Providing an open avenue of communication between the governing board, management and the functions of internal and external audit; (f) Serving as an issue resolution forum in cases where there are differences in respect of opinions or recommendations between managers and auditors or investigators, or among the auditors themselves; (g) Promoting an organization-wide culture that accepts the importance and value of the internal audit, inspection and investigation functions and providing 9 A/60/312 executive heads with the assurance that these functions are operating effectively and efficiently. Composition 20. In general, the membership of the committees ranges from six to nine members, primarily high-ranking or senior management officers. However, external (United Nations or non-United Nations) members are strategically included either because of their present position as is the case at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) or because of their professional qualifications, expertise and/or competence as is the case at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). External members usually serve for a two-year renewable term. Meetings 21. The committees generally meet up to four times per annum. However the chairperson in most cases possesses the discretionary authority to call additional meetings if deemed appropriate, for example, to initiate discussion of emerging audit matters. The executive head in some instances can also request that the chairperson convene a meeting. Reporting 22. The committees generally report to either the executive head or to the governing body (for example, the executive council). It is worth noting that the committees within the United Nations system generally report to their executive heads, while the committees within the multinational financial institutions and other international organizations report to their executive boards. IV. Strengthening of the oversight mechanisms 23. Independent oversight is an essential part of any comprehensive system of accountability. At the United Nations, there are three main bodies that provide this function, namely, the Board of Auditors, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU. Without the audit of financial statements, the investigation of complaints, the evaluation of programme performance, and all the other reviews carried out by these bodies, both internal management and the governing bodies would not have an impartial assessment of the functioning of the Organization or, where shortcomings are identified, be in a position to hold accountable those responsible. It is therefore essential that the oversight bodies be independent, have the capacity to carry out their functions, and provide full coverage of all aspects of the functioning of the Organization. It is also essential that effective follow-up action be taken on the basis of their findings, including implementation of recommendations and analysis of their reports, to address systemic weaknesses. The measures described in the present section of this report address these issues. 10 A/60/312 A. Establishment of the United Nations Oversight Committee 24. As has been described in section III of this report, the Secretariat initiated a review of audit committees in order to establish a similar body at the United Nations. Pursuant to the initiation of this review, the General Assembly, in resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, requested the establishment of a high-level follow-up mechanism under the authority of the Secretary-General to effectively feed findings and recommendations of the oversight bodies into the executive management processes. 25. Utilizing the findings of the Secretariat's review, terms of reference for a United Nations Oversight Committee have been prepared and are ready for issuance. The Oversight Committee will function as an independent advisory panel to the Secretary-General. Its objectives include ensuring the systematic implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies; sharing audit-related information and lessons learned within the Secretariat, where appropriate; and ensuring that significant risks to the Organization are identified and mitigating measures taken. Its responsibilities will include: (a) Ensuring that appropriate and timely action is taken by the relevant managers to rectify problems in areas of concern identified by oversight bodies, and to effectively manage risks within the organization; (b) Alerting the Secretary-General on systemic organizational issues that may arise from audit, investigation or evaluation reports, and making recommendations as appropriate; (c) On behalf of the Secretary-General, providing advice and suggestions on the priorities, long-term strategy and annual audit workplans of oversight bodies and requesting that significant risks identified be included in such workplans; (d) Preparing the Secretary-General's response to reports of oversight bodies submitted to the General Assembly, taking into account the input provided by the departments or offices concerned; (e) Rendering advice on audit related-matters to the Secretary-General and departmental heads as it deems appropriate; (f) Encouraging and facilitating, if necessary, collaboration and cooperation among the various oversight bodies. 26. The Secretary-General will appoint a Chairperson and three additional members to the Committee. The Chairperson and two of the members will be senior Secretariat officials at a rank no lower than that of Assistant Secretary-General. The other member will be external to the Secretariat. Members of the Committee shall serve for a period of two years, renewable once, with the renewal period phased so as to provide continuity. Committee members shall act in an independent capacity while performing their advisory role on the Committee. The Committee shall meet at the request of the Chairperson or any member as required but no less than once every calendar quarter. The Under-Secretary-General for Management will attend meetings in an ex officio capacity. 27. The Committee is required to produce an annual report on its work for the previous year, which will be presented to the Secretary-General during the first calendar quarter of each year. The Committee will also contribute to the annual 11 A/60/312 report to the General Assembly on measures taken to improve accountability in the Secretariat. 28. It should be noted that some of the functions identified during the review of the audit committees of other organizations have not been included in the terms of reference  of  the  Oversight  Committee.  These  would  include  making recommendations on the resource requirements of the various oversight bodies; assessment of the efforts of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Board of Auditors and JIU to strengthen the Organization's internal controls; and the identification of possible gaps in the United Nations oversight coverage. It is considered that these functions would not be appropriately discharged by a committee reporting directly to the Secretary-General. However, additional strengthening of United Nations oversight is currently under discussion in the General Assembly. B. Enhancement of fraud and corruption prevention mechanisms 29. In paragraph 349 of volume I of the report of the Board of Auditors (A/59/5 (vol. I), chap. I), the Board recommended, inter alia, that the Administration: (a) Implement a comprehensive and well-communicated corruption and fraud prevention plan in the United Nations system; (b) Establish a corruption and fraud prevention committee that would serve as an effective framework and coordination point for a United Nations system corruption and fraud prevention mechanism; (c) Conduct ethics, corruption and fraud awareness training sessions and workshops among managers, international and local employees and other stakeholders; (d) Develop appropriate resolution mechanisms for reported and detected incidents and allegations of corruption and fraud. A clarification was obtained from the Board that the word ""system"" mentioned in its recommendation referred to the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 30. The United Nations already has in place many rules, procedures and controls designed to prevent fraud and corruption. However, based on the Board's recommendation, new efforts have been initiated to draw a more comprehensive plan, addressing all aspects of corruption and fraud prevention. To that end, a working group has been established to propose such a plan. As a first step, the working group is drawing up an anti-corruption and fraud prevention policy which will draw on existing best practices, including the model recently developed by the World Bank. 31. The working group will also propose an effective mechanism through which to coordinate the efforts on corruption and fraud prevention of the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 32. A training programme will be part of the overall corruption and fraud prevention plan. It will include general awareness training, as well as specific modules for functions where the risk of fraud and corruption is higher. The programme will address staff at all levels of the Organization. 12 A/60/312 C. Efforts to strengthen the Office of Internal Oversight Services 33. The Office of Internal Oversight Services in its tenth annual report to the General Assembly (see A/59/359) provided the results of its own self-evaluation to assist the Assembly in carrying out its review and evaluation of the Office in 2004. The self-evaluation exercise looked at strengths and weaknesses and pointed to areas where the Office could be improved. In addition, in his note transmitting the annual report to the Assembly, the Secretary-General recommended to the Assembly that the Office undergo a comprehensive external review in order to strengthen its capacity to carry out all aspects of its work. That recommendation was reiterated in paragraph 192 of the Secretary-General's report entitled ""In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all"" (A/59/2005). 34. The General Assembly in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/272 affirmed that any external review of the Office of Internal Oversight Services could be undertaken only by such bodies as the Board of Auditors or JIU, or those mandated to do so by the Assembly. It is recommended that the scope of such a review should include the investigation processes at offices away from Headquarters as recommended by the Board. 35. Apart from any external review that may be undertaken as a result of the Secretary-General's proposals above, measures have already been taken to strengthen the investigation function of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. In resolution 59/287 of 13 April 2005, the General Assembly re-emphasized that the Office was the internal body entrusted with investigation in the United Nations and therefore decided that the results of all preliminary investigations conducted by programme managers should be reported to the Office. Pursuant to the adoption of this resolution, the Office now has independent, residual and exclusive authority to investigate the most serious cases (all ""category one"" cases, that is to say, all high- risk, complex matters and serious criminal cases). An added layer of oversight determines that the Office must be informed of the results of all ""category two"" cases (cases of lower risk to the Organization) investigated by programme managers, so that the Office can have an overview of all matters that have been investigated by the Organization. D. Review of governance structures and the format of accountability reports 36. The way in which financial reports and reports of oversight bodies are considered and acted upon represents an essential part of the accountability process. Recognizing this, the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 57/278 A of 20 December 2002 (later reaffirmed in resolution 59/264 A) requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to examine governance structures, principles and accountability throughout the United Nations system and to make proposals on the future format and consideration of the reports of the Board of Auditors by the respective executive boards and the Assembly. The matter was taken up and discussed by the High-level Committee on Management (HLCM) at its eighth session, held in Rome on 5 and 6 October 2004. At that session, the Committee decided that, in the first instance, this item should be carried forward by the Finance and Budget Network, in particular as regards format and consideration of the reports of the Board of 13 A/60/312 Auditors, and requested that the secretariat of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) carry out consultations with the Board of Auditors and obtain more detailed information on the scope and objectives of this review (see CEB/2004/6, para. 60). Member States are currently seized with the subject of strengthening governance arrangements in the context of the discussions on the outcome document for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the Assembly. 37. Related to this subject is the recommendation of the Board of Auditors that covered the issue of governance principles and best practices related to financial reporting. It pointed out that in its view, the following governance issues were normally reported on in a medium such as the financial report that preceded the financial statements: (a) governance and other regulatory bodies; (b) performance reporting and non-financial information; (c) social accounting issues; and (d) risk management, continuity and internal control (A/59/5/Add.2, chap. II, para. 25). 38. At its ninth session held at Geneva in April 2005, the High-level Committee on Management decided to set up a working group to examine current accountability mechanisms in organizations, to raise awareness of such tools and to identify best practices (see CEB/2005/3, para. 22 (f)). It was recognized that this issue was very broad and was related to overall organizational culture and not just audit processes (ibid., para. 21). Therefore, the working group will comprise representatives of budget, finance and human resources management. The terms of reference of this working group will, inter alia, include addressing the resolutions and recommendations referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 above. V. Ensuring ethical conduct 39. The commitment to the highest ethical standards at the United Nations is a core value and fundamental guiding principle in ensuring that the Organization achieves its mission. In response to the findings of a Secretariat-wide staff survey, the probes into the management of the oil-for-food programme and the allegations of sexual misconduct in various peace missions, the United Nations has begun implementing additional measures to address deficiencies and ensure a culture of ethical conduct. A. Proposed establishment of the United Nations Office of Ethics 40. Underlying the main effort of the Secretariat in that regard is the proposal for the establishment of an independent Office of Ethics, the head of which will report directly to the Secretary-General. The objective of the Office will be to assist the Organization in maintaining the highest standards of integrity, as required by the Charter of the United Nations and thereby maintain and enhance international confidence in the United Nations through fostering a culture of ethical conduct, transparency and accountability, setting and disseminating standards for appropriate professional conduct and providing leadership, management and oversight of the United Nations ethics infrastructure. Proposals for the establishment of the Office of Ethics, along with its terms of reference, are currently under preparation for the consideration of the General Assembly. 14 A/60/312 B. Financial disclosure by senior officials 41. In July 2005, the Secretary-General decided to broaden the scope of financial disclosure, as currently required of senior officials, including those employed on a short-term basis or under special conditions. This followed a review of disclosure practices in comparable organizations. The appropriate mechanisms for monitoring these disclosures are also under review for immediate strengthening. It is envisaged that the scope of annual financial disclosure and declaration of interest will be broadened from the Assistant Secretary-General/Under-Secretary-General level to include all staff at the D-1 level and above. The financial disclosure threshold levels will be lowered for assets and income from $25,000 to $10,000 and for gifts from $10,000 to $250. 42. The financial disclosure programme will be administered by the proposed Office of Ethics, pursuant to its establishment. The implementation of the expanded financial disclosure regime will require an amendment of staff regulation 1.2 (n) by the General Assembly. C. Protection against retaliation for exposure of wrongdoing or reporting of irregularities and misconduct 43. The Secretary-General is finalizing a comprehensive policy to ensure protection against retaliation for reporting of alleged misconduct. This policy will complement existing administrative issuances concerning avenues for the reporting of alleged misconduct that are set out in information circular ST/IC/2005/19. It is essential that staff have confidence in these mechanisms and assurance that the appropriate level of protection is provided. For this reason, additional rounds of consultation with the staff have been conducted on the terms of the new policy. D. Enhancement of codes of conduct and conflict-of-interest rules 44. While the United Nations has in place a detailed Code of Conduct readily available to all staff on the Intranet, it is now planned to disseminate the Code in other ways. The Secretary-General has commissioned the design of a user-friendly orientation and information booklet for distribution in the latter part of 2005 to all staff based on the Secretary-General's bulletin on the status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members (ST/SGB/2002/13). Special additional rules are also being developed for staff engaged in procurement activities. In this respect, a Declaration of Independence to be signed by all staff members working in the procurement process has been prepared and an administrative issuance on rules governing the conduct of staff engaged in procurement activities is being finalized for adoption by the Secretary-General. A United Nations Supplier Code of Conduct is also being formulated. It is expected that all these materials will be produced and ready for dissemination in the near future. 45. The Office of Ethics, once established, will be responsible for standard-setting on ethics issues and training, in coordination with the Office of Human Resources Management. 15 A/60/312 E. Incorporation of ethics into staff training programmes 46. Staff will be required to complete a new downloadable content module on integrity and ethics provisions for self-training that has now been completed in the form of a CD-ROM. In addition, ethics modules have been incorporated into all existing training programmes for United Nations staff, including at induction, and the Career Resources Centre (CRC) offers a lunchtime programme on ethics. It is envisaged that both the CD-ROM on integrity and the Career Resources Centre ethics programme will be mandatory for all staff. F. Protection against harassment in the workplace 47. While the United Nations has a zero tolerance sexual harassment policy in place, the Secretary-General is in the process of formulating a new, broader policy to encompass other forms of harassment. This will be introduced following consultation with the staff representative bodies. The United Nations Secretariat has also joined the United Nations Development Group in the development and implementation of an online learning programme on harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority, which, once available, will be mandatory for all staff. G. Response to allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by field personnel 48. In addition to the efforts in place for dealing with the issues of harassment and sexual misconduct, in response to the widespread allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse at some United Nations peacekeeping operations, there has been aggressive pursuit by the Organization of such cases. As of July 2005, across all peacekeeping operations, 186 peacekeepers had been investigated for sexual exploitation and abuse; 7 United Nations civilians had been summarily dismissed; and 80 members of military contingents had been expelled from the field missions. Investigations into such allegations are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Haiti in particular. Additionally, a number of short- and medium-term initiatives are under way, including: (a) The introduction of a unified standard of conduct across all categories of peacekeeping personnel. Mandatory training on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse has been integrated into all mission induction programmes. Improved complaint mechanisms have been established in all missions, including telephone hotlines and a network of Focal Points for Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, who receive complaints in person. In addition, missions are ensuring that victims of sexual abuse are referred to existing emergency assistance (medical, psychosocial, legal) in the mission area; (b) A global review of the state of discipline in peacekeeping operations conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the results of which are currently being analysed; (c) The establishment by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of a Conduct and Discipline Unit at United Nations Headquarters. Over the coming months, similar capacity will be created in eight Department of Peacekeeping 16 A/60/312 Operations missions. The Units will focus on preventing misconduct through various means, including awareness-raising and training and improving welfare and recreation facilities. Other key activities of such Units will include tracking data on misconduct cases for all categories of peacekeeping personnel and developing measures to ensure compliance with United Nations standards of conduct, such as the establishment of lists of premises considered out of bounds for United Nations personnel. Such Units will work with in-country networks on sexual exploitation and abuse, developed to better coordinate and share information on this problem; (d) The approval by the General Assembly in June 2005 of 19 new Office of Internal Oversight Services investigator positions, as well as additional investigative resources for following up allegations of misconduct in peacekeeping missions. 49. In the longer term, a comprehensive review will be undertaken of the welfare and recreation needs of all peacekeeping personnel, as well as the development of a comprehensive strategy for victim assistance. New agreements with troop- contributing countries and United Nations partners will be developed. In addition, a group of legal experts will be examining ways to ensure that United Nations staff and experts on mission are held responsible for criminal acts committed in countries where no functioning judicial system exists. H. Dissemination of information concerning the Secretary-General's decisions in disciplinary matters 50. Starting  in  2002,  two  information  circulars  (ST/IC/2002/25  and ST/IC/2004/28) were issued that informed all staff of the Secretary-General's practice in disciplinary matters. It is expected that the sharing of information with staff members concerning decisions on disciplinary cases will not only raise awareness and enhance transparency in disciplinary matters, but also have a deterrent effect and thus enhance ethical conduct. VI. Enhancing transparency 51. Transparency is an essential feature of any system of accountability. By making decision-making processes, performance data, transaction processing, and general information about the Organization more accessible, the United Nations becomes more accountable to Member States, staff and civil society. A major vehicle for improving transparency has been Internet technology, and the United Nations home page has been enhanced during the last few years to become a strategic communication tool. Efforts are also ongoing to increase awareness inside the United Nations of Intranet capabilities, and build on existing features, such as the Procurement and Facilities Management tracking systems, that give transparency to administrative processes. In addition to the continuous expansion of the Intranet, Extranet and Internet, there are other measures aimed at improving the openness of the operation of the United Nations, which are described below. 17 A/60/312 A. Access to United Nations information 52. The Secretary-General has initiated an assessment of best practices in public administrations around the world and examined various models of information access in different countries in developing a clear and consistent policy for determining which United Nations documents should be accessible outside the Secretariat. In the latter part of 2005, the Management Committee will review this comprehensive assessment and will provide guidance for a new policy. It should be noted that access to United Nations documentation that is neither restricted nor confidential is now freely available on the Internet through the Official Document System. B. Selection and appointment of senior officials 53. In order to enhance transparency in the appointment of senior officials, the Secretary-General has put in place a new selection process which ensures a much wider search for qualified candidates and allows for a rigorous, open process against predetermined criteria for all senior United Nations officials and heads of United Nations funds and programmes. As part of the new mechanism, the Senior Appointment Group (SAG) reviews candidatures for appointment by the Secretary- General. The Chef de Cabinet then constitutes an interview panel with a minimum of four members of the Group. The names of two or more finalists are then submitted to the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General for final consideration. 54. In the case of senior appointments that involve intergovernmental bodies in the appointment process (for example, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the Office of Internal Oversight Services), shortlists are drawn up from a list of nominations submitted in response to a request for such nomination by the Secretary-General addressed to Members States and relevant institutions. Shortlists would also be developed through a more informal process of outreach and search. In the case of Secretariat appointments of a specialized nature, an outside technical expert may be invited to be part of the relevant interview panel. In all cases, clear job descriptions and required competencies will have been developed against which candidates can be judged. A more systematic process of vetting and reference-checking of candidates will be instituted, with external assistance whenever necessary. The Secretary-General will in all cases have the ultimate authority to make the final selection, taking into account other factors, such as geographical distribution and gender balance. Since the establishment of this new procedure, several senior-level posts have been filled via the new system, including those of UNDP, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and UNHCR. C. Senior Review Group 55. The Secretary-General has constituted a Senior Review Group as a standing advisory body to make recommendations to the Secretary-General on appointment and promotion to posts at the D-2 level. For the purpose of defining the terms of 18 A/60/312 reference of the Group, Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/4 was promulgated on 28 February 2005 and the membership of the Group was presented in information circular ST/IC/2005/33 of 1 July 2005. In accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the Secretary-General's bulletin, all appointments to this body are made by the Secretary-General. According to section 3, all D-2 vacancy announcements, except for vacant posts in the Executive Office of the Secretary- General and for the special envoys, are to be circulated. D. External validation of the procurement system 56. The Volcker Inquiry was critical of various United Nations procurement cases in the early years of the oil-for-food programme. However, since the mid-1990s, a major overhaul of the United Nations procurement process has been undertaken, making it more transparent and addressing any shortcomings identified in a number of different reviews. In the light of issues raised by the Volcker Inquiry, the Secretary-General commissioned a review, completed in June 2005, that compared existing procurement rules and regulations with the best global practices of outside organizations and companies in order to ensure that the improvements introduced since the mid to late 1990s met the highest global standards. In addition, in August 2005, the Secretary-General commissioned a full financial and internal control review of the United Nations current procurement system. 57. The June 2005 review evaluated positively the transparency achieved by the United Nations Procurement Service website. The review stated that the Service website (http://www.un.org/Depts/ptd) was an extensive, well-designed site with current information directly relevant to the needs of prospective and active suppliers and that the transparent and open approach of the Service to sourcing and vendor development was directly in line with that of leading public procurement agencies. E. Accounting standards 58. The adoption of clear standards for accounting purposes is essential for transparent financial reporting. The High Level Committee on Management has approved a project for the development of such accounting standards within the United Nations system. This project is being undertaken by a Task Force under the auspices of the Committee's Finance and Budget Network. Possible standards have been identified and final proposals will be submitted by the Task Force to the Finance and Budget Network for approval prior to their presentation to the Committee for endorsement. VII. Time frames for implementation of the recommendations of the oversight bodies 59. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 59/264 A, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to indicate expected time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors, including the office-holders to be held accountable. A similar request was later reiterated in paragraph 6 of resolution 264 B; and in paragraph 7 of the same resolution, the Secretary-General 19 A/60/312 was further requested to provide an assessment to the Assembly at its sixtieth session on the progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of recommendations of the Board. 60. As per annex III of the present report, approximately 73 per cent of the recommendations addressed to the United Nations, and reported as outstanding to the Board of Auditors as at the end of June 2004, had time frames assigned for implementation. For the United Nations University (UNU), the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, time frames were provided in 82 per cent, 50 per cent, 40 per cent and 47 per cent of cases, respectively. For all four organizations, the office-holders responsible for implementation were clearly identified for all outstanding recommendations. The progress towards proper assignment of time frames was acknowledged by the Board in paragraph 1 (a) of its current report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session on the status of implementation of its recommendations relating to the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex). 61. Owing to the high priority given to the implementation of all the approved recommendations of the Board of Auditors and the other oversight bodies, efforts have been intensified by the Secretariat to ensure that the recommendations of the other oversight bodies, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU also have responsible  office-holders  assigned  and  time  frames  defined  for  their implementation. The Oversight Committee will have an overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with these requirements. 62. Overall progress is being made towards improving implementation rates. The Board of Auditors was pleased to note that the overall proportion of implementation of 34 per cent of the previous biennium had increased to 46 per cent in the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex, para. 9). VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 63. This report describes the measures taken by the Secretary-General to strengthen the system of accountability at the United Nations. In formulating these measures, the Secretary-General has taken into account the need for: (a) the clear definition of authority and results to be achieved; (b) the establishment of appropriate support and guidance mechanisms; (c) the strengthening of systems to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of performance; and (d) the provision of follow-up mechanisms that lead to appropriate recognition of both good and unsatisfactory performance, and investigations and appropriate corrective action if necessary. 64. Many of the measures described, such as the establishment of the Management Performance Board and the proposed establishment of the Office of Ethics, will themselves lead to a further examination of the way that the United Nations 20 A/60/312 conducts its business and to additional measures to improve the system of accountability. Together with those already described in this report, they will help achieve the goal of ensuring that programme managers and staff are held accountable for the effective delivery of their work and the way they conduct themselves, and that both management and staff operate in an open and transparent environment, free from unethical conduct. 65. The General Assembly may wish to take note of this report, including of the fact that new elements are being added to the accountability framework that will strengthen accountability in the Secretariat. 21 A/60/312 Annex I The accountability framework Responsibility and authority Accountability Mechanism       Charter of the United Nations General Assembly and other intergovernmental bodies Provide mandates and overall policy guidance to the Secretary-General for the execution of these mandates as well as those given to the Secretary-General directly by the Charter of the United Nations.

Introduction 1. The present report has been submitted pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, in which the Assembly mandated the Secretary-General to submit annually to the Assembly a report under the agenda item entitled ""Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations"" addressing the measures aimed at strengthening accountability in the Secretariat. This report also responds to paragraph 11 of resolution 59/264 A of 23 December 2004 and paragraph 7 of resolution 59/264 B of 22 June 2005, in which the Assembly called, respectively, for an assessment of the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, and an assessment of progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors. 2. Since the submission to the General Assembly of the last report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Accountability and responsibility"" (A/55/270 of 3 August 2000), there have been continuing efforts to strengthen accountability at the United Nations. However, the Secretariat is now facing an unprecedented series of organizational challenges which have exposed shortcomings in the way it conducts its business. The Secretary-General is therefore taking additional actions where it is within his authority to do so, particularly in the critical areas of the accountability framework, oversight, ethics and transparency. 3. This report is organized into six parts covering the following headings: measures for strengthening the accountability framework; assessment of experiences with audit committees; establishment of oversight mechanisms; ensuring ethical conduct; enhancing transparency; and timely implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies. II. Measures to strengthen the accountability framework 4. The accountability framework at the United Nations is based on a hierarchy headed by the General Assembly that flows through the Secretary-General, senior managers and middle management to all other staff. Annex I to this report provides a schematic representation of this structure and the mechanisms that support it. At each level in the hierarchy, it is essential that there be clearly defined responsibilities and performance expectations and that there be mechanisms in place that enable both routine and formal assessment of performance. The measures described in the present section of this report are aimed at ensuring that: (a) the Secretary-General receives the necessary advice to properly assess the performance of senior managers; (b) executive-level decisions are clearly understood and followed up; (c) senior managers understand what is expected from them; and (d) the mechanism for formal appraisal of all staff, including managers, is improved. A. Reconstituting of the Accountability Panel as the Management Performance Board 5. Through the promulgation of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/13, which took effect from 13 May 2005, the Secretary-General has replaced the 5 A/60/312 Accountability Panel with the Management Performance Board. The Board's terms of reference and responsibilities are clearer and better defined than those of the Panel. The Board will advise the Secretary-General on matters concerning the performance of individual senior managers. Its functions include reviewing the material recommendations of the Oversight Committee (see sect. IV of this report) and ensuring that managers act on serious managerial issues identified by its oversight bodies. It will also monitor the manner in which senior managers exercise all aspects of the authority that has been delegated to them, including their performance in achieving the objectives contained in human resources action plans, and review the outcome of the administration of justice proceedings in the Secretariat for management accountability purposes. 6. The members of the Management Performance Board will be appointed by the Secretary-General for a two-year term, which may be renewable. Its membership will consist of a chairperson, who will be the Deputy Secretary-General, two members at the Under-Secretary-General level and an external expert in public sector management. 7. In July 2005, the Deputy Secretary-General chaired the first organizational meeting of the Management Performance Board, which conducted a review of existing sources of managerial performance data. The Department of Management was requested to review methods of performance assessments used in other comparable organizations, with a view to preparing proposals for a set of qualitative and quantitative performance indicators covering both programmatic and managerial functions that would enable a high-level evaluation of a senior manager's performance. The Board is expected to consider these proposals at its next meeting in the fourth quarter of 2005. B. Improving executive-level decision-making 8. Recognizing the value in having the ability to take high-level decisions on a timely basis and in an effort to ensure that mechanisms would be in place to hold senior management accountable for follow-up action, the Secretary-General established a Senior Management Group as part of his initial reform programme in 1997. The Group comprised all heads of Secretariat departments and United Nations offices, funds and programmes. As a result, coordination and coherence within the United Nations family have since been enhanced. In practice, however, while having real utility as an information-sharing body, the Group has proved too large for effective and timely decision-making. Consequently, two smaller senior-level committees, a Policy Committee and a Management Committee -- both chaired by the Secretary-General -- have been created. The modus operandi of these Committees will ensure clear expectations, and clear definition of responsibility and timelines for implementation. As of 30 June 2005, the Policy Committee had met on six occasions since its establishment in May 2005 and has presented the Secretary- General with policy options on a wide range of issues. The Management Committee held its first meeting on 20 May 2005 to review progress made to date on management reform and later met in July 2005 to endorse a number of reform proposals. 6 A/60/312 C. Introducing mandatory induction programmes for senior officials 9. A more robust approach to ensuring that senior officials are adequately informed on the broader system of United Nations regulations and rules, code of conduct and managerial systems is required. To meet this need, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations piloted its first induction session in June 2005 for a group of newly appointed leaders in a number of field missions. The programme, which is intended to be conducted biannually, will cover sessions on conduct and requirements for management performance. At the same time, a broader induction programme for senior-level recruits is being developed in the rest of the United Nations Secretariat. It is expected that this will be launched by the end of 2005. A consolidated reference guide on delegation of authority has been prepared and will act both as a training aid during the induction programmes and as a reference document designed to clarify the responsibilities that are delegated to senior officials. D. Defining performance expectations for programme delivery 10. An essential component of the accountability framework is the clear and meaningful measurement of programme delivery. To this end, as part of the Secretary-General's first round of reforms, results-based budgeting was introduced. A comprehensive set of performance indicators for all programmes, including peacekeeping missions, have now been developed. For the programme budget for 2004-2005 and the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007, performance measures, namely, baselines and targets, have also been included. 11. To gain maximum benefit from these performance indicators, monitoring and evaluation are being enhanced. The Office of Internal Oversight Services presented its latest recommendations on this subject to the General Assembly in its reports on strengthening the role of evaluation findings in programme design, delivery and policy directives (see A/59/79) and further specific proposals (which were prepared jointly with the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU)) on the strengthening and monitoring of programme  performance  and  evaluation  (A/60/73).  The  measures  being implemented will include improvements in data-collection and monitoring systems and strengthening of self-evaluation. Programme managers are required to include in their budget proposals for the biennium 2006-2007 adequate resources to effectively evaluate their programme performance. 12. The improvements in monitoring and evaluation combined with the performance indicators contained in the biennial programme plan and the programme budget will provide the basis for objective reporting of performance both to Member States through the programme performance report and to the new Management Performance Board. These inputs, together with the independent inspection and evaluation reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU, will put the Board in a position to provide the Secretary-General with the advice he needs to hold his senior managers accountable for the results they achieve in delivering their work programmes. 7 A/60/312 E. Enhancing the Performance Appraisal System 13. As part of the overall accountability framework, the e-PAS is the formal tool employed in holding staff accountable for their performance. The system has the basic objective of creating a fair, equitable, transparent and measurable system of performance management in support of a results-based culture that recognizes and rewards excellent performance while adequately addressing underperformance. The system applies to all staff and managers except the heads of departments who are currently subject to annual assessment through their programme management plans. The e-PAS represents an enhancement of the original Performance Appraisal System (PAS), and was introduced after extensive consultations throughout the Secretariat. Incorporated into the revised e-PAS system are the following features: (a) The organizational core values and competencies, in order to provide a fuller picture of performance; (b) Self-assessment by staff members; (c) The managerial competencies for supervisory staff so as to provide an assessment of their supervisory skills; (d) Strengthened links between performance management and career development; (e) Enhanced accountability measures such as the inclusion of an optional section in the e-PAS for the comments of staff on supervision received. F. Requiring personal financial liability of staff 14. The Secretary-General has defined the conditions, through staff rules 112.3, 212.2 and 312.2, under which staff members may be required to reimburse the United Nations, either partially or in full, for any financial loss suffered by the Organization as a result of the staff member's gross negligence or violation of the regulations and procedures. To that end, administrative instruction ST/AI/2004/3 of 29 September 2004 was promulgated. The instructions also define the conditions for implementing financial rule 101.2, under which any staff member who violates the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) or corresponding administrative instructions, may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions. III. Assessment of experience with audit and oversight committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations 15. At its fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly, in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/264 A, having taken note of the Secretariat's effort in collecting information on the experiences of audit committees within the United Nations system and other international organizations, requested the Secretary-General to report on and provide an assessment of its findings to the Assembly at its sixtieth session. 8 A/60/312 16. The Secretariat collected the information on audit committees during 2004. Thirty-three organizations were involved, grouped in four categories: specialized agencies and related organizations; funds and programmes; multinational financial institutions; and other international organizations. The Secretariat's analysis revealed that 60 per cent of the organizations involved in the survey had already established an oversight mechanism (see annex II). These oversight mechanisms were referred to as either audit committees or oversight committees. It is worth noting that even the organizations that do not have an institutionalized audit committee have set up mechanisms to review internal and external audit matters as well as progress made in implementing audit recommendations. In some of these cases, it is the relevant programme and budget committee that plays this role. 17. When considering the role of the audit committees within an organization, it is important to recognize the distinction between the committees that operate as advisory panels to either the respective executive heads or the executive boards and those that are part of the governing body of the organization. The latter is the case in most of the multinational financial institutions like the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). 18. The responsibilities of the oversight committees generally include: (a) Reviewing the strategy and workplans of internal and, in some organizations, external audit; and discussing the scope and content of their audits so as to identify audit priorities and suggesting potential audit areas within which to address the organization's risks; (b) Reviewing the findings and recommendations emanating from the reports, inspection and investigations, including those on irregularities and fraud; (c) Ensuring that appropriate and timely actions are taken by the management in implementing the recommendations of the internal and external oversight bodies and monitoring follow-up action thereon. 19. In addition, other responsibilities of some of the committees include: (a) Assessing the integrity of the financial statements of the organizations and their accounting, financial reporting and disclosure policies and practices; (b) Reviewing risk management and the internal control system; (c) Making recommendations with regard to the appointments and tenure of members of the external board of auditors; (d) Assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of internal and external audit services; (e) Providing an open avenue of communication between the governing board, management and the functions of internal and external audit; (f) Serving as an issue resolution forum in cases where there are differences in respect of opinions or recommendations between managers and auditors or investigators, or among the auditors themselves; (g) Promoting an organization-wide culture that accepts the importance and value of the internal audit, inspection and investigation functions and providing 9 A/60/312 executive heads with the assurance that these functions are operating effectively and efficiently. Composition 20. In general, the membership of the committees ranges from six to nine members, primarily high-ranking or senior management officers. However, external (United Nations or non-United Nations) members are strategically included either because of their present position as is the case at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) or because of their professional qualifications, expertise and/or competence as is the case at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). External members usually serve for a two-year renewable term. Meetings 21. The committees generally meet up to four times per annum. However the chairperson in most cases possesses the discretionary authority to call additional meetings if deemed appropriate, for example, to initiate discussion of emerging audit matters. The executive head in some instances can also request that the chairperson convene a meeting. Reporting 22. The committees generally report to either the executive head or to the governing body (for example, the executive council). It is worth noting that the committees within the United Nations system generally report to their executive heads, while the committees within the multinational financial institutions and other international organizations report to their executive boards. IV. Strengthening of the oversight mechanisms 23. Independent oversight is an essential part of any comprehensive system of accountability. At the United Nations, there are three main bodies that provide this function, namely, the Board of Auditors, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU. Without the audit of financial statements, the investigation of complaints, the evaluation of programme performance, and all the other reviews carried out by these bodies, both internal management and the governing bodies would not have an impartial assessment of the functioning of the Organization or, where shortcomings are identified, be in a position to hold accountable those responsible. It is therefore essential that the oversight bodies be independent, have the capacity to carry out their functions, and provide full coverage of all aspects of the functioning of the Organization. It is also essential that effective follow-up action be taken on the basis of their findings, including implementation of recommendations and analysis of their reports, to address systemic weaknesses. The measures described in the present section of this report address these issues. 10 A/60/312 A. Establishment of the United Nations Oversight Committee 24. As has been described in section III of this report, the Secretariat initiated a review of audit committees in order to establish a similar body at the United Nations. Pursuant to the initiation of this review, the General Assembly, in resolution 59/272 of 23 December 2004, requested the establishment of a high-level follow-up mechanism under the authority of the Secretary-General to effectively feed findings and recommendations of the oversight bodies into the executive management processes. 25. Utilizing the findings of the Secretariat's review, terms of reference for a United Nations Oversight Committee have been prepared and are ready for issuance. The Oversight Committee will function as an independent advisory panel to the Secretary-General. Its objectives include ensuring the systematic implementation of recommendations of the oversight bodies; sharing audit-related information and lessons learned within the Secretariat, where appropriate; and ensuring that significant risks to the Organization are identified and mitigating measures taken. Its responsibilities will include: (a) Ensuring that appropriate and timely action is taken by the relevant managers to rectify problems in areas of concern identified by oversight bodies, and to effectively manage risks within the organization; (b) Alerting the Secretary-General on systemic organizational issues that may arise from audit, investigation or evaluation reports, and making recommendations as appropriate; (c) On behalf of the Secretary-General, providing advice and suggestions on the priorities, long-term strategy and annual audit workplans of oversight bodies and requesting that significant risks identified be included in such workplans; (d) Preparing the Secretary-General's response to reports of oversight bodies submitted to the General Assembly, taking into account the input provided by the departments or offices concerned; (e) Rendering advice on audit related-matters to the Secretary-General and departmental heads as it deems appropriate; (f) Encouraging and facilitating, if necessary, collaboration and cooperation among the various oversight bodies. 26. The Secretary-General will appoint a Chairperson and three additional members to the Committee. The Chairperson and two of the members will be senior Secretariat officials at a rank no lower than that of Assistant Secretary-General. The other member will be external to the Secretariat. Members of the Committee shall serve for a period of two years, renewable once, with the renewal period phased so as to provide continuity. Committee members shall act in an independent capacity while performing their advisory role on the Committee. The Committee shall meet at the request of the Chairperson or any member as required but no less than once every calendar quarter. The Under-Secretary-General for Management will attend meetings in an ex officio capacity. 27. The Committee is required to produce an annual report on its work for the previous year, which will be presented to the Secretary-General during the first calendar quarter of each year. The Committee will also contribute to the annual 11 A/60/312 report to the General Assembly on measures taken to improve accountability in the Secretariat. 28. It should be noted that some of the functions identified during the review of the audit committees of other organizations have not been included in the terms of reference  of  the  Oversight  Committee.  These  would  include  making recommendations on the resource requirements of the various oversight bodies; assessment of the efforts of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Board of Auditors and JIU to strengthen the Organization's internal controls; and the identification of possible gaps in the United Nations oversight coverage. It is considered that these functions would not be appropriately discharged by a committee reporting directly to the Secretary-General. However, additional strengthening of United Nations oversight is currently under discussion in the General Assembly. B. Enhancement of fraud and corruption prevention mechanisms 29. In paragraph 349 of volume I of the report of the Board of Auditors (A/59/5 (vol. I), chap. I), the Board recommended, inter alia, that the Administration: (a) Implement a comprehensive and well-communicated corruption and fraud prevention plan in the United Nations system; (b) Establish a corruption and fraud prevention committee that would serve as an effective framework and coordination point for a United Nations system corruption and fraud prevention mechanism; (c) Conduct ethics, corruption and fraud awareness training sessions and workshops among managers, international and local employees and other stakeholders; (d) Develop appropriate resolution mechanisms for reported and detected incidents and allegations of corruption and fraud. A clarification was obtained from the Board that the word ""system"" mentioned in its recommendation referred to the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 30. The United Nations already has in place many rules, procedures and controls designed to prevent fraud and corruption. However, based on the Board's recommendation, new efforts have been initiated to draw a more comprehensive plan, addressing all aspects of corruption and fraud prevention. To that end, a working group has been established to propose such a plan. As a first step, the working group is drawing up an anti-corruption and fraud prevention policy which will draw on existing best practices, including the model recently developed by the World Bank. 31. The working group will also propose an effective mechanism through which to coordinate the efforts on corruption and fraud prevention of the United Nations and its funds and programmes. 32. A training programme will be part of the overall corruption and fraud prevention plan. It will include general awareness training, as well as specific modules for functions where the risk of fraud and corruption is higher. The programme will address staff at all levels of the Organization. 12 A/60/312 C. Efforts to strengthen the Office of Internal Oversight Services 33. The Office of Internal Oversight Services in its tenth annual report to the General Assembly (see A/59/359) provided the results of its own self-evaluation to assist the Assembly in carrying out its review and evaluation of the Office in 2004. The self-evaluation exercise looked at strengths and weaknesses and pointed to areas where the Office could be improved. In addition, in his note transmitting the annual report to the Assembly, the Secretary-General recommended to the Assembly that the Office undergo a comprehensive external review in order to strengthen its capacity to carry out all aspects of its work. That recommendation was reiterated in paragraph 192 of the Secretary-General's report entitled ""In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all"" (A/59/2005). 34. The General Assembly in paragraph 11 of its resolution 59/272 affirmed that any external review of the Office of Internal Oversight Services could be undertaken only by such bodies as the Board of Auditors or JIU, or those mandated to do so by the Assembly. It is recommended that the scope of such a review should include the investigation processes at offices away from Headquarters as recommended by the Board. 35. Apart from any external review that may be undertaken as a result of the Secretary-General's proposals above, measures have already been taken to strengthen the investigation function of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. In resolution 59/287 of 13 April 2005, the General Assembly re-emphasized that the Office was the internal body entrusted with investigation in the United Nations and therefore decided that the results of all preliminary investigations conducted by programme managers should be reported to the Office. Pursuant to the adoption of this resolution, the Office now has independent, residual and exclusive authority to investigate the most serious cases (all ""category one"" cases, that is to say, all high- risk, complex matters and serious criminal cases). An added layer of oversight determines that the Office must be informed of the results of all ""category two"" cases (cases of lower risk to the Organization) investigated by programme managers, so that the Office can have an overview of all matters that have been investigated by the Organization. D. Review of governance structures and the format of accountability reports 36. The way in which financial reports and reports of oversight bodies are considered and acted upon represents an essential part of the accountability process. Recognizing this, the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 57/278 A of 20 December 2002 (later reaffirmed in resolution 59/264 A) requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to examine governance structures, principles and accountability throughout the United Nations system and to make proposals on the future format and consideration of the reports of the Board of Auditors by the respective executive boards and the Assembly. The matter was taken up and discussed by the High-level Committee on Management (HLCM) at its eighth session, held in Rome on 5 and 6 October 2004. At that session, the Committee decided that, in the first instance, this item should be carried forward by the Finance and Budget Network, in particular as regards format and consideration of the reports of the Board of 13 A/60/312 Auditors, and requested that the secretariat of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) carry out consultations with the Board of Auditors and obtain more detailed information on the scope and objectives of this review (see CEB/2004/6, para. 60). Member States are currently seized with the subject of strengthening governance arrangements in the context of the discussions on the outcome document for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the Assembly. 37. Related to this subject is the recommendation of the Board of Auditors that covered the issue of governance principles and best practices related to financial reporting. It pointed out that in its view, the following governance issues were normally reported on in a medium such as the financial report that preceded the financial statements: (a) governance and other regulatory bodies; (b) performance reporting and non-financial information; (c) social accounting issues; and (d) risk management, continuity and internal control (A/59/5/Add.2, chap. II, para. 25). 38. At its ninth session held at Geneva in April 2005, the High-level Committee on Management decided to set up a working group to examine current accountability mechanisms in organizations, to raise awareness of such tools and to identify best practices (see CEB/2005/3, para. 22 (f)). It was recognized that this issue was very broad and was related to overall organizational culture and not just audit processes (ibid., para. 21). Therefore, the working group will comprise representatives of budget, finance and human resources management. The terms of reference of this working group will, inter alia, include addressing the resolutions and recommendations referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 above. V. Ensuring ethical conduct 39. The commitment to the highest ethical standards at the United Nations is a core value and fundamental guiding principle in ensuring that the Organization achieves its mission. In response to the findings of a Secretariat-wide staff survey, the probes into the management of the oil-for-food programme and the allegations of sexual misconduct in various peace missions, the United Nations has begun implementing additional measures to address deficiencies and ensure a culture of ethical conduct. A. Proposed establishment of the United Nations Office of Ethics 40. Underlying the main effort of the Secretariat in that regard is the proposal for the establishment of an independent Office of Ethics, the head of which will report directly to the Secretary-General. The objective of the Office will be to assist the Organization in maintaining the highest standards of integrity, as required by the Charter of the United Nations and thereby maintain and enhance international confidence in the United Nations through fostering a culture of ethical conduct, transparency and accountability, setting and disseminating standards for appropriate professional conduct and providing leadership, management and oversight of the United Nations ethics infrastructure. Proposals for the establishment of the Office of Ethics, along with its terms of reference, are currently under preparation for the consideration of the General Assembly. 14 A/60/312 B. Financial disclosure by senior officials 41. In July 2005, the Secretary-General decided to broaden the scope of financial disclosure, as currently required of senior officials, including those employed on a short-term basis or under special conditions. This followed a review of disclosure practices in comparable organizations. The appropriate mechanisms for monitoring these disclosures are also under review for immediate strengthening. It is envisaged that the scope of annual financial disclosure and declaration of interest will be broadened from the Assistant Secretary-General/Under-Secretary-General level to include all staff at the D-1 level and above. The financial disclosure threshold levels will be lowered for assets and income from $25,000 to $10,000 and for gifts from $10,000 to $250. 42. The financial disclosure programme will be administered by the proposed Office of Ethics, pursuant to its establishment. The implementation of the expanded financial disclosure regime will require an amendment of staff regulation 1.2 (n) by the General Assembly. C. Protection against retaliation for exposure of wrongdoing or reporting of irregularities and misconduct 43. The Secretary-General is finalizing a comprehensive policy to ensure protection against retaliation for reporting of alleged misconduct. This policy will complement existing administrative issuances concerning avenues for the reporting of alleged misconduct that are set out in information circular ST/IC/2005/19. It is essential that staff have confidence in these mechanisms and assurance that the appropriate level of protection is provided. For this reason, additional rounds of consultation with the staff have been conducted on the terms of the new policy. D. Enhancement of codes of conduct and conflict-of-interest rules 44. While the United Nations has in place a detailed Code of Conduct readily available to all staff on the Intranet, it is now planned to disseminate the Code in other ways. The Secretary-General has commissioned the design of a user-friendly orientation and information booklet for distribution in the latter part of 2005 to all staff based on the Secretary-General's bulletin on the status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members (ST/SGB/2002/13). Special additional rules are also being developed for staff engaged in procurement activities. In this respect, a Declaration of Independence to be signed by all staff members working in the procurement process has been prepared and an administrative issuance on rules governing the conduct of staff engaged in procurement activities is being finalized for adoption by the Secretary-General. A United Nations Supplier Code of Conduct is also being formulated. It is expected that all these materials will be produced and ready for dissemination in the near future. 45. The Office of Ethics, once established, will be responsible for standard-setting on ethics issues and training, in coordination with the Office of Human Resources Management. 15 A/60/312 E. Incorporation of ethics into staff training programmes 46. Staff will be required to complete a new downloadable content module on integrity and ethics provisions for self-training that has now been completed in the form of a CD-ROM. In addition, ethics modules have been incorporated into all existing training programmes for United Nations staff, including at induction, and the Career Resources Centre (CRC) offers a lunchtime programme on ethics. It is envisaged that both the CD-ROM on integrity and the Career Resources Centre ethics programme will be mandatory for all staff. F. Protection against harassment in the workplace 47. While the United Nations has a zero tolerance sexual harassment policy in place, the Secretary-General is in the process of formulating a new, broader policy to encompass other forms of harassment. This will be introduced following consultation with the staff representative bodies. The United Nations Secretariat has also joined the United Nations Development Group in the development and implementation of an online learning programme on harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority, which, once available, will be mandatory for all staff. G. Response to allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by field personnel 48. In addition to the efforts in place for dealing with the issues of harassment and sexual misconduct, in response to the widespread allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse at some United Nations peacekeeping operations, there has been aggressive pursuit by the Organization of such cases. As of July 2005, across all peacekeeping operations, 186 peacekeepers had been investigated for sexual exploitation and abuse; 7 United Nations civilians had been summarily dismissed; and 80 members of military contingents had been expelled from the field missions. Investigations into such allegations are ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Haiti in particular. Additionally, a number of short- and medium-term initiatives are under way, including: (a) The introduction of a unified standard of conduct across all categories of peacekeeping personnel. Mandatory training on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse has been integrated into all mission induction programmes. Improved complaint mechanisms have been established in all missions, including telephone hotlines and a network of Focal Points for Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, who receive complaints in person. In addition, missions are ensuring that victims of sexual abuse are referred to existing emergency assistance (medical, psychosocial, legal) in the mission area; (b) A global review of the state of discipline in peacekeeping operations conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the results of which are currently being analysed; (c) The establishment by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of a Conduct and Discipline Unit at United Nations Headquarters. Over the coming months, similar capacity will be created in eight Department of Peacekeeping 16 A/60/312 Operations missions. The Units will focus on preventing misconduct through various means, including awareness-raising and training and improving welfare and recreation facilities. Other key activities of such Units will include tracking data on misconduct cases for all categories of peacekeeping personnel and developing measures to ensure compliance with United Nations standards of conduct, such as the establishment of lists of premises considered out of bounds for United Nations personnel. Such Units will work with in-country networks on sexual exploitation and abuse, developed to better coordinate and share information on this problem; (d) The approval by the General Assembly in June 2005 of 19 new Office of Internal Oversight Services investigator positions, as well as additional investigative resources for following up allegations of misconduct in peacekeeping missions. 49. In the longer term, a comprehensive review will be undertaken of the welfare and recreation needs of all peacekeeping personnel, as well as the development of a comprehensive strategy for victim assistance. New agreements with troop- contributing countries and United Nations partners will be developed. In addition, a group of legal experts will be examining ways to ensure that United Nations staff and experts on mission are held responsible for criminal acts committed in countries where no functioning judicial system exists. H. Dissemination of information concerning the Secretary-General's decisions in disciplinary matters 50. Starting  in  2002,  two  information  circulars  (ST/IC/2002/25  and ST/IC/2004/28) were issued that informed all staff of the Secretary-General's practice in disciplinary matters. It is expected that the sharing of information with staff members concerning decisions on disciplinary cases will not only raise awareness and enhance transparency in disciplinary matters, but also have a deterrent effect and thus enhance ethical conduct. VI. Enhancing transparency 51. Transparency is an essential feature of any system of accountability. By making decision-making processes, performance data, transaction processing, and general information about the Organization more accessible, the United Nations becomes more accountable to Member States, staff and civil society. A major vehicle for improving transparency has been Internet technology, and the United Nations home page has been enhanced during the last few years to become a strategic communication tool. Efforts are also ongoing to increase awareness inside the United Nations of Intranet capabilities, and build on existing features, such as the Procurement and Facilities Management tracking systems, that give transparency to administrative processes. In addition to the continuous expansion of the Intranet, Extranet and Internet, there are other measures aimed at improving the openness of the operation of the United Nations, which are described below. 17 A/60/312 A. Access to United Nations information 52. The Secretary-General has initiated an assessment of best practices in public administrations around the world and examined various models of information access in different countries in developing a clear and consistent policy for determining which United Nations documents should be accessible outside the Secretariat. In the latter part of 2005, the Management Committee will review this comprehensive assessment and will provide guidance for a new policy. It should be noted that access to United Nations documentation that is neither restricted nor confidential is now freely available on the Internet through the Official Document System. B. Selection and appointment of senior officials 53. In order to enhance transparency in the appointment of senior officials, the Secretary-General has put in place a new selection process which ensures a much wider search for qualified candidates and allows for a rigorous, open process against predetermined criteria for all senior United Nations officials and heads of United Nations funds and programmes. As part of the new mechanism, the Senior Appointment Group (SAG) reviews candidatures for appointment by the Secretary- General. The Chef de Cabinet then constitutes an interview panel with a minimum of four members of the Group. The names of two or more finalists are then submitted to the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General for final consideration. 54. In the case of senior appointments that involve intergovernmental bodies in the appointment process (for example, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the Office of Internal Oversight Services), shortlists are drawn up from a list of nominations submitted in response to a request for such nomination by the Secretary-General addressed to Members States and relevant institutions. Shortlists would also be developed through a more informal process of outreach and search. In the case of Secretariat appointments of a specialized nature, an outside technical expert may be invited to be part of the relevant interview panel. In all cases, clear job descriptions and required competencies will have been developed against which candidates can be judged. A more systematic process of vetting and reference-checking of candidates will be instituted, with external assistance whenever necessary. The Secretary-General will in all cases have the ultimate authority to make the final selection, taking into account other factors, such as geographical distribution and gender balance. Since the establishment of this new procedure, several senior-level posts have been filled via the new system, including those of UNDP, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and UNHCR. C. Senior Review Group 55. The Secretary-General has constituted a Senior Review Group as a standing advisory body to make recommendations to the Secretary-General on appointment and promotion to posts at the D-2 level. For the purpose of defining the terms of 18 A/60/312 reference of the Group, Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/4 was promulgated on 28 February 2005 and the membership of the Group was presented in information circular ST/IC/2005/33 of 1 July 2005. In accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the Secretary-General's bulletin, all appointments to this body are made by the Secretary-General. According to section 3, all D-2 vacancy announcements, except for vacant posts in the Executive Office of the Secretary- General and for the special envoys, are to be circulated. D. External validation of the procurement system 56. The Volcker Inquiry was critical of various United Nations procurement cases in the early years of the oil-for-food programme. However, since the mid-1990s, a major overhaul of the United Nations procurement process has been undertaken, making it more transparent and addressing any shortcomings identified in a number of different reviews. In the light of issues raised by the Volcker Inquiry, the Secretary-General commissioned a review, completed in June 2005, that compared existing procurement rules and regulations with the best global practices of outside organizations and companies in order to ensure that the improvements introduced since the mid to late 1990s met the highest global standards. In addition, in August 2005, the Secretary-General commissioned a full financial and internal control review of the United Nations current procurement system. 57. The June 2005 review evaluated positively the transparency achieved by the United Nations Procurement Service website. The review stated that the Service website (http://www.un.org/Depts/ptd) was an extensive, well-designed site with current information directly relevant to the needs of prospective and active suppliers and that the transparent and open approach of the Service to sourcing and vendor development was directly in line with that of leading public procurement agencies. E. Accounting standards 58. The adoption of clear standards for accounting purposes is essential for transparent financial reporting. The High Level Committee on Management has approved a project for the development of such accounting standards within the United Nations system. This project is being undertaken by a Task Force under the auspices of the Committee's Finance and Budget Network. Possible standards have been identified and final proposals will be submitted by the Task Force to the Finance and Budget Network for approval prior to their presentation to the Committee for endorsement. VII. Time frames for implementation of the recommendations of the oversight bodies 59. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 59/264 A, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the funds and programmes of the United Nations to indicate expected time frames for the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors, including the office-holders to be held accountable. A similar request was later reiterated in paragraph 6 of resolution 264 B; and in paragraph 7 of the same resolution, the Secretary-General 19 A/60/312 was further requested to provide an assessment to the Assembly at its sixtieth session on the progress achieved towards assigning time frames for the implementation of recommendations of the Board. 60. As per annex III of the present report, approximately 73 per cent of the recommendations addressed to the United Nations, and reported as outstanding to the Board of Auditors as at the end of June 2004, had time frames assigned for implementation. For the United Nations University (UNU), the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, time frames were provided in 82 per cent, 50 per cent, 40 per cent and 47 per cent of cases, respectively. For all four organizations, the office-holders responsible for implementation were clearly identified for all outstanding recommendations. The progress towards proper assignment of time frames was acknowledged by the Board in paragraph 1 (a) of its current report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session on the status of implementation of its recommendations relating to the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex). 61. Owing to the high priority given to the implementation of all the approved recommendations of the Board of Auditors and the other oversight bodies, efforts have been intensified by the Secretariat to ensure that the recommendations of the other oversight bodies, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and JIU also have responsible  office-holders  assigned  and  time  frames  defined  for  their implementation. The Oversight Committee will have an overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with these requirements. 62. Overall progress is being made towards improving implementation rates. The Board of Auditors was pleased to note that the overall proportion of implementation of 34 per cent of the previous biennium had increased to 46 per cent in the biennium 2002-2003 (see A/60/113, annex, para. 9). VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 63. This report describes the measures taken by the Secretary-General to strengthen the system of accountability at the United Nations. In formulating these measures, the Secretary-General has taken into account the need for: (a) the clear definition of authority and results to be achieved; (b) the establishment of appropriate support and guidance mechanisms; (c) the strengthening of systems to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of performance; and (d) the provision of follow-up mechanisms that lead to appropriate recognition of both good and unsatisfactory performance, and investigations and appropriate corrective action if necessary. 64. Many of the measures described, such as the establishment of the Management Performance Board and the proposed establishment of the Office of Ethics, will themselves lead to a further examination of the way that the United Nations 20 A/60/312 conducts its business and to additional measures to improve the system of accountability. Together with those already described in this report, they will help achieve the goal of ensuring that programme managers and staff are held accountable for the effective delivery of their work and the way they conduct themselves, and that both management and staff operate in an open and transparent environment, free from unethical conduct. 65. The General Assembly may wish to take note of this report, including of the fact that new elements are being added to the accountability framework that will strengthen accountability in the Secretariat. 21 A/60/312 Annex I The accountability framework Responsibility and authority Accountability Mechanism       Charter of the United Nations General Assembly and other intergovernmental bodies Provide mandates and overall policy guidance to the Secretary-General for the execution of these mandates as well as those given to the Secretary-General directly by the Charter of the United Nations.

"accountability","  United Nations    ST/IC/2006/30       Secretariat      16 August 2006       06-47198 (E)    210806      *0647198*  Information circular*      To: Members of the staff      From: The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management      Subject: Outside activities      1.  The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members of the  Organization's procedures relating to outside activities, which are set out in  administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/13.        Outside occupation or employment    2.  The basic rule is that staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation  or employment, whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary- General.  3.  The first requirement for approval is that there be no conflict with the staff  member's official functions or status as an international civil servant. The outside  occupation or employment should not interfere with the staff member's ability to  perform his or her duties or call into question his or her impartiality and  independence as an international civil servant.   4.  The second requirement is that the outside activity not be against the interest  of the United Nations as, for example, working with an organization whose goals  are incompatible with those of the United Nations or working in a capacity that  would call into question the staff member's impartiality or independence.  5.  The third requirement is that the outside occupation or employment be  permitted by local law at the duty station or where the occupation or employment  occurs.  6.  Staff members authorized to engage in outside activities shall make clear to  the organizers and participants in such activities, including any employers,  that they  act in their personal capacity and not as representatives of the United Nations.          Activities related to the United Nations    7.  Unless they form part of the normal course of official duties, prior  authorization is required for staff members to engage in any of the following acts, if  they relate to the purpose, activities or interests of the United Nations:        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2006/30      06-47198  2      (a)  Issuance of statements to the press, radio or other agencies of public  information;    (b)  Acceptance of speaking engagements;    (c)  Taking part in film, theatre, radio or television productions;    (d)  Submitting articles, books or other material for publication.  8.  Outside activities that are of benefit to the Organization or the achievement of  its goals and/or contribute to the development of professional skills of staff  members are usually not only permitted but encouraged.         Other outside activities          Social or charitable activities and pursuit of studies    9.  Private non-remunerated activities for social or charitable purposes not related  to the staff member's official functions or to the United Nations and pursuit of  studies may be engaged in at the staff member's discretion as long as those activities  take place outside of working hours or while the staff member is on leave.        Political activities    10. Staff members may exercise the right to vote.  Staff members should ensure  that their participation in political activities does not reflect adversely upon their  status as independent and impartial international civil servants. Staff members  cannot thus be candidates for political office. Membership in a political party is  permitted, provided it does not entail action or obligation to action that would  reflect adversely on their status as international civil servants. In case of doubt as to  whether the activity is permitted, enquiries may be made by the staff member  concerned, as indicated in paragraphs 12 and 13 below.        Participation in boards, panels, committees, expert groups and similar bodies    11. Participation in boards, panels, committees, expert groups or similar bodies  that are external to the Organization constitutes an outside activity that requires the  prior approval of the Secretary-General. If, after approval has been granted, it  appears that the staff member's participation would involve the consideration of the  granting of an honour, gift or remuneration to a United Nations official, the staff  member should withdraw from the body concerned since his or her participation  would create at least the appearance of a conflict of interest.        Clarification procedures    12. Sections 6.1 to 6.5 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/13 set out  procedures whereby a staff member may seek in confidence clarification as to  whether a planned outside occupation, employment or activity would conflict with  his or her status as an international civil servant.  13. Staff members are also reminded that the Ethics Office, which was established  to assist the Secretary-General in ensuring that all staff members observe and  perform their functions consistent with the highest standards of integrity  required  by the Charter of the United Nations, provides confidential advice and guidance to  staff on ethical issues, including conflict of interest.    ST/IC/2006/30   3  06-47198        Approval procedures    14. Sections 6.6 to 6.9 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/13 set out the  procedures to be followed by a staff member wishing to engage in an outside  activity for which prior approval is required under sections 3 and 4 of the  instruction.

"accountability","  United Nations    ST/AI/2021/4      Secretariat      13 August 2021      21-11428 (E)    270821  *2111428*         Administrative instruction         Performance Management and Development System        The Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance,  pursuant to section 4.2 of the Secretary-General's bulletin on procedures for the  promulgation of administrative issuances (ST/SGB/2009/4), and for the purpose of  updating the policies and procedures for performance management and development,  pursuant to staff rule 1.3, promulgates the following:         Section 1      Scope of application      All staff members who hold appointments of at least one year (except for staff  at the levels of Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General, staff  members who sign a senior manager's compact with the Secretary-General and staff  performing the functions of Resident Coordinator) shall have their performance  evaluated in accordance with the Performance Management and Development  System. The present instruction does not apply to staff members holding temporary  appointments, who may be evaluated under the provisions of the administrative  instruction on administration of temporary appointments (ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1).         Section 2      Purpose, roles and responsibilities    2.1 The key goals of the Performance Management and Development System are to  establish a framework that allows for the fair and equitable evaluation of the  performance of staff members and to foster a culture of regular feedback.   2.2 Staff members, including first and second reporting officers, have a duty to fulfil  their obligations and to be active participants in the development and assessment  processes, was well as to fully comply with the procedures established herein. Heads  of entity1 have a duty to ensure that staff members fully comply with the obligation  under staff rule 1.3 (c).   __________________    1  For the purposes of the present instruction, the term ""entity"" means a department or an office,  including an office away from Headquarters, a special political or peacekeeping mission, a  regional commission, a resident or regional coordinator office or any other unit tasked with  programmed activities.  ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  2/13    2.3 The purpose of the Performance Management and Development System is also  to improve the delivery of programmes by optimizing individual performance at all  levels, which it will achieve by:    (a)  Promoting a culture of accountability and adherence to United Nations  standards of conduct;    (b)  Promoting a culture of high performance, personal and professional  development and continuous learning;    (c)  Empowering managers and holding them responsible and accountable for  managing their staff;    (d)  Encouraging a high level of staff participation in the planning, delivery  and evaluation of work;     (e)  Recognizing successful performance and addressing underperformance  fairly and equitably.  2.4 The function of the Performance Management and Development System is to  promote communication between staff members and supervisors throughout the  performance management and development cycle, including on the goals and key  results to be achieved and the success criteria by which individual performance will  be assessed. The System enables a culture that promotes continuous learning and  personal and professional development, recognizes successful performance and  addresses performance shortcomings.   2.5 The Performance Management and Development System is supported by an  electronic application that captures the main stages of the performance process,  namely the workplan and the end-of-cycle performance review. The application also  acts as a reporting tool that provides key metrics in support of the performance  management and development cycle.         Section 3      Performance management and development cycle    3.1 The performance management and development cycle should normally be  12 months, beginning on 1 April of each year and ending on 31 March of the  following year. However, as provided in sections 3.2 and 3.3, the performance period  may be shorter or longer than the 12-month cycle, normally no less than 6 months or  longer than 18 months.  3.2 When a staff member takes up new duties upon recruitment, transfer or  assignment in the course of the cycle, an individual workplan should normally be  established within the first two months of assumption of the new functions. If a staff  member actively serves with a Secretariat entity for less than six months during the  cycle, no performance document is required to be completed.   3.3 Upon a staff member's separation from service, or when a staff member takes  up new duties upon reassignment or transfer, the performance document shall be  completed by the staff member and his or her supervisor for the period between the  beginning of the performance period and the date of reassignment, transfer or  separation. If the staff member performs the same functions but serves under  successive supervisors during the year, the supervisor of the staff member at the time  at which the cycle ends shall complete the end-of-cycle evaluation, and prior  supervisors should be consulted or, if applicable, act as additional supervisors for the  relevant workplan goals.  3.4 To ensure the timely completion of the performance document, if supervisors  separate from the United Nations, it is their responsibility to complete the    ST/AI/2021/4    3/13  21-11428    Performance Management and Development System duties required of them before  the date of separation. Separation procedures and processing of final entitlements of  supervisors may be delayed until any duties relating to the evaluations for which they  are responsible are completed.        Section 4      Staff members    4.1 All staff members shall fulfil their responsibilities under the Performance  Management and Development System. Staff members are responsible for:    (a)  Understanding the larger organizational goals;    (b)  Soliciting clarification on individual performance expectations;    (c)  Participating in a dialogue with the first reporting officer to facilitate the  development and finalization of the individual workplan and maintaining milestone  discussions during the reporting period. Milestone discussions occur at a frequency  agreed upon at the start of the cycle and are recorded by the first reporting officer;    (d)  Participating in performance conversations with the first reporting officer  on recognition of good performance, identifying areas for further development and  addressing shortcomings, if any, at the time at which they arise. Performance  conversations occur outside the regular intervals set initially for milestone  discussions and are not necessarily recorded;    (e)  Taking steps to complete each stage of the process for which they are  responsible without delay;    (f)  Accepting or declining the invitation to participate in multi-rater, or ""360- degree"", feedback evaluations in accordance with section 8.4, if invited to do so.  4.2 Non-compliance with the terms of the present instruction by a staff member  should be recorded in the individual performance document and reflected in the  overall rating. The staff member prepares and uploads the workplan. Any  disagreement between the staff member and the first reporting officer may be resolved  with the second reporting officer in accordance with section 5.4. If the staff member  does not take the required action in time to submit a workplan for the cycle, the first  reporting officer may upload a final workplan to the system.        Section 5      Reporting officers and additional supervisors    5.1 A first reporting officer shall be designated for each staff member at the  beginning of the performance management and development cycle. The first reporting  officer is responsible for:    (a)  Developing the workplan with the staff member, incorporating appropriate  competencies into the workplan and emphasizing core values in support of the  performance management process;    (b)  Conducting milestone discussions at a frequency agreed upon at the start  of the cycle, and recognizing good performance and any shortcomings as they become  apparent at any time during the cycle, as appropriate, in performance conversations  outside the regular intervals set initially for the milestone discussions;     (c)  Conducting and recording the final evaluation;    (d)  Advising, supporting and coaching the staff member on professional  development and in the development of a personal and professional development  plan;  ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  4/13      (e)  Developing a performance improvement plan in consultation with the staff  member in the case of performance shortcomings or underperformance, if applicable;    (f)  Ensuring that the performance documents of their supervisees are  completed in accordance with the prescribed procedures.  5.2 The first reporting officer should normally be the supervisor of the staff member.  However, under exceptional circumstances, heads of entity may approve, when  warranted, a first reporting officer who is not the staff member's supervisor, but who  is in a position to fulfil the roles and responsibilities of a first reporting officer as  outlined in the present instruction.   5.3 Up to two additional supervisors may be designated when a staff member works  for more than one supervisor more than 25 per cent of the time or on assignments of  at least 30 working days, provided that such arrangements are put into place with the  agreement of the first reporting officer at the work planning stage, at the beginning  of the additional assignment or when the staff member's supervisor changes during  the cycle.  5.4 The second reporting officer, who should normally be the first reporting  officer's supervisor or the equivalent, is responsible for:    (a)  Ensuring that the first reporting officer understands and applies the  principles and procedures of the Performance Management and Development System;    (b)  Holding the first reporting officer accountable for developing, in a timely  manner, together with their staff, workplans with fair, realistic and consistent  performance expectations and ensuring linkages between the priorities of the entity  and the work unit with the individual workplans;    (c)  Holding the first reporting officer accountable for the timely completion  of the staff member's end-of-cycle evaluation;    (d)  Providing regular feedback on and evaluating the first reporting officer's  ability to manage and support the performance of his or her supervisees;    (e)  Resolving disagreements between the staff member and the first reporting  officer in the implementation of the Performance Management and Development  System;     (f)  Overseeing the establishment and implementation of a performance  improvement plan in case of performance shortcomings or underperformance, as  provided for in section 10 of the present instruction.  5.5 Second reporting officers also have the broader responsibility of ensuring that  the Performance Management and Development System is consistently and fairly  applied across work units by all first reporting officers who report to them. The second  reporting officer should ensure fairness and consistency throughout the cycle, in  particular when defining performance expectations and communicating performance  standards. The second reporting officer should ensure that:    (a)  There is consistency between the comments on and the overall rating of  individual staff members for a given performance management and development  cycle;    (b)  Ratings and comments given are factually sound, free of bias, constructive  and consistent;    (c)  Managers incorporate appropriate competencies into the workplan and  emphasize core values in support of the performance management process.    ST/AI/2021/4    5/13  21-11428    5.6 The second reporting officer shall oversee the multi-rater, or ""360-degree"",  feedback evaluations.  5.7 A staff member normally has one second reporting officer at any given time in  the reporting cycle. The first reporting officer and the second reporting officer should  not be the same person. However, under exceptional circumstances and after  consultation with the staff member, there may be only one reporting officer when it  is not possible to identify two different individuals to be the first and second reporting  officers.  5.8 Non-compliance with the terms of the present instruction by first or second  reporting officers should be recorded in their performance documents and be reflected  in their overall ratings. To this effect, their workplans should include a goal for timely  implementation of and compliance with the Performance Management and  Development System.         Section 6      Priorities of the entity, and work unit and individual plans     6.1 Before the beginning of the performance management and development cycle,  and for the purposes of strengthening accountability in the Secretariat, heads of entity  should sign a compact with the Secretary-General. Priorities of heads of entity are  translated into the workplans of work units in accordance with each entity's structure.  Work unit plans are developed in consultation with staff members concerned on an  annual basis, depending on the needs of the entity, and are regularly reviewed by the  first and second reporting officers to ensure that the plans remain relevant and  achievable. Heads of entity are responsible for ensuring that managers and staff fully  understand what is expected of them for the reporting period and how those individual  expectations fit into the wider mandates of the entity.        Individual plans    6.2 At the beginning of the cycle, supervisors should meet with the staff under their  direct supervision to ensure that the objectives of the work unit are understood and  that individual workplans are prepared. Supervisors may meet with their staff either  as a group or individually.   6.3 First reporting officers shall work with the staff members whom they supervise  on the development of the staff member's individual workplan for the cycle. The work  planning stage includes establishing individual performance evaluation criteria by  setting goals, key results and achievements, incorporating competencies into the  formulation of those goals, key results and achievements and formulating a personal  and professional development plan, as follows:     (a)  Workplan: upon the conclusion of the dialogue and agreement with the  first reporting officer, the staff member revises, if necessary, and submits the final  workplan to the first reporting officer. The format of the workplan may vary  depending on the functions of the staff member, but should include results-oriented  elements, such as goals, key results and achievements, actions to take to achieve each  goal, key result and achievement and measurement, through a statement of success  criteria, performance expectations and behavioural indicators, to evaluate  performance at the end of the cycle. When more than one staff member performs  similar functions, performance expectations may be collectively developed while  allowing for individual variations, where appropriate;    (b)  Competencies: the organizational competencies listed in the relevant  Secretary-General's bulletin on the subject (ST/SGB/1999/15) define a performance  standard against which all staff can be consistently and objectively evaluated. All staff  ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  6/13    members are held accountable for demonstrating the core values. In their dialogue on  the workplan, the staff member and the first reporting officer shall list in the workplan  the most relevant competencies related to each of the goals, key results and  achievements identified for the reporting cycle and, where appropriate, the input from  the multi-rater, or ""360-degree"", feedback evaluations received during the prior cycle.  Specific job-related competencies may be added, where appropriate;    (c)  Personal and professional development plan: every staff member is  expected to complete a development plan. Staff members may indicate competencies  that they wish to strengthen and career aspirations for future assignments. Every staff  member is expected to set a minimum target of five days for professional development  per year in accordance with the Secretary-General's bulletin on the learning and  development policy (ST/SGB/2009/9).         Section 7      Performance conversations and milestone discussions    7.1 During the year, the first reporting officer and the staff member should have  ongoing performance conversations, whether verbally or in writing, which should be  used to acknowledge good performance and address any shortcomings.   7.2 The first reporting officer should conduct milestone discussions at regular  intervals agreed upon with the staff member. Such discussions should include  progress made and an explanation of any updates to the workplan goals, key results  and achievements. The first reporting officer should also note progress made in  demonstrating the competencies and in implementing the personal and professional  development plan. The staff member may note the progress made towards the goals  set in the workplan, the competencies and the personal and professional development  plan. Documentation of the milestone discussions is the responsibility of the first  reporting officer.         Section 8      End-of-cycle performance review    8.1 After the end of the performance management and development cycle, the first  reporting officer and the staff member shall meet, by electronic means if necessary,  to discuss the staff member's overall performance during the cycle. The meeting  should be held within three months after the end of the cycle.  8.2 Before the end-of-cycle evaluation between the first reporting officer and the  staff member, the staff member is encouraged to conduct an appraisal of the manner  in which he or she implemented the workplan defined at the beginning of the cycle.   8.3 The first reporting officer shall evaluate the extent to which the staff member  achieved the goals, key results and achievements set out in the workplan. The first  reporting officer shall also consider and comment on the manner in which the staff  member demonstrated the core values and competencies incorporated into the goals.  The first reporting officer may comment on the staff member's self-appraisal during  the evaluation of the staff member. First reporting officers are encouraged to discuss  the career aspirations of staff during the end-of-cycle review. An overall rating of the  staff member's performance shall be given by the first reporting officer pursuant to  section 9.   8.4 With regard to multi-rater, or ""360-degree"", feedback evaluation, staff with  managerial or supervisory responsibilities may be rated in the electronic 360-degree  application by the staff whom they supervise. Such evaluation will be progressively  rolled out and expanded to include feedback from peers and supervisors. The first    ST/AI/2021/4    7/13  21-11428    reporting officer shall take into account the 360-degree feedback, as well as input  from additional supervisors designated in accordance with section 5.2.  8.5 The second reporting officer shall review and endorse, as appropriate, the  evaluation of the first reporting officer, in accordance with his or her role as described  in sections 5.4 and 5.5. Should the second reporting officer have queries on or  concerns regarding the application of the Performance Management and Development  System, they should be discussed with the first reporting officer to ensure an overall  consistent performance document.   8.6 All parties should electronically sign or acknowledge the completed  performance document. The electronic signature of the staff member constitutes an  acknowledgement that the performance review has been conducted. It does not  indicate that the staff member is in agreement with the evaluation. The rebuttal  process outlined in section 15 cannot be initiated unless the staff member has signed  off on the finalized evaluation. A performance document submitted for electronic  signature to a staff member that the staff member does not sign is considered to be  signed by the staff member after 14 days of its receipt by the staff member. A staff  member who does not sign the performance document shall be so notified, and the  14-day period for submission of a rebuttal statement by the staff member, pursuant to  section 15.1, shall begin as of the date of such notification to the staff member.         Section 9      Rating system        Individual core values and competencies    9.1 Staff shall be appraised on the basis of the indicators that correspond to each of  the core values and competencies as incorporated into the goals, key results and  achievements. Such appraisal shall be taken into consideration in the determination  of the overall performance rating.  9.2 Evaluation of the level of demonstration of each of the core values and  competencies by the staff member during the performance management and  development cycle should be based on the degree to which the individual has been  observed as acting or behaving in accordance with the particular competency or value  and is a basis for staff development.        Overall performance rating    9.3 Staff may be given one of the following four overall ratings:    * Exceeds performance expectations    * Successfully meets performance expectations    * Partially meets performance expectations     * Does not meet performance expectations  9.4 A rating of ""exceeds performance expectations"" should be considered in cases  in which the staff member has surpassed the defined success criteria and/or  performance expectations for the majority of the goals, key results and achievements,  has continually gone beyond expectations or has significantly surpassed success  criteria and/or performance expectations in quantity and quality during the cycle,  including in demonstrating core values and competencies, as applicable.  9.5 A rating of ""successfully meets performance expectations"" should be considered  in cases in which the staff member has fully achieved the defined success criteria  and/or performance expectations for the majority of the goals, key results and  ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  8/13    achievements during the cycle, including in demonstrating core values and  competencies, as applicable.   9.6 The ratings of ""exceeds performance expectations"" and ""successfully meets  performance expectations"" establish full satisfaction with the work performed and  justify awarding a salary increment in accordance with section 16.3. The ratings shall  be so viewed when staff members are considered for selection for a position without  prejudice to the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General to appoint staff  members.   9.7 A rating of ""partially meets performance expectations"" should be considered if  the staff member did not meet the defined success criteria and/or performance  expectations for some of the goals, key results and achievements but demonstrates  potential for and a commitment to developing and applying the required skills.   9.8 A rating of ""does not meet performance expectations"" should be considered if  the staff member did not meet the defined success criteria or performance  expectations for the majority of the goals, key results and achievements and  demonstrates an inability to develop and apply the required skills or a lack of  commitment thereto.   9.9 A rating of ""partially meets performance expectations"" or ""does not meet  performance expectations"" indicates the existence of performance shortcomings.         Section 10      Identifying and addressing performance shortcomings and  unsatisfactory performance     10.1 During the performance cycle, the first reporting officer should continually  evaluate performance. When a performance shortcoming is identified during the  performance cycle, the first reporting officer, in consultation with the second  reporting officer, should proactively assist the staff member in remedying the  shortcoming. Remedial measures may include counselling, transfer to more suitable  functions, additional training and/or the institution of a time-bound performance  improvement plan, which should include clear targets for improvement and a  provision for coaching and supervision by the first reporting officer in conjunction  with performance conversations, which should be held on a regular basis.  10.2 If the performance shortcoming was not rectified following the remedial  measures indicated in section 10.1 and if, at the end of the performance cycle,  performance is appraised overall as ""partially meets performance expectations"", a  written performance improvement plan shall be prepared by the first reporting officer.  This shall be done in consultation with the staff member and the second reporting  officer. The performance improvement plan may cover up to a six-month period.  10.3 If the performance shortcoming was not rectified following the remedial  measures indicated in section 10.1, a number of administrative actions may ensue,  including the withholding of a within-grade salary increment pursuant to section 16.4,  the non-renewal of an appointment or the termination of an appointment for  unsatisfactory service in accordance with staff regulation 9.3.  10.4 If, at the end of the performance cycle, performance is appraised overall as ""does  not meet performance expectations"", the appointment may be terminated so long as  the remedial measures indicated in section 10.1 included a performance improvement  plan that was initiated no less than three months before the end of the performance  cycle.  10.5 Should unsatisfactory performance be the basis for a decision for non-renewal  of a fixed-term appointment, and should the appointment expire before the end of the    ST/AI/2021/4    9/13  21-11428    period covering a performance improvement plan, the appointment should be renewed  for the duration necessary for the completion of the performance improvement plan.        Section 11      Implementation and monitoring by heads of entity    11.1 Heads of entity are responsible for the implementation of the Performance  Management and Development System.   11.2 Primary responsibility for the timely execution of, overall compliance with and  consistent and fair implementation of the Performance Management and  Development System rests with the head of entity, who should promote  communication between staff members and their supervisors, encourage regular  feedback through performance conversations and milestone discussions and ensure  that any change in the mandate or priorities of the entity is communicated to staff.   11.3 The head of entity is responsible for compliance with, and consistency and  fairness in the implementation (including ratings) of, the Performance Management  and Development System and the provision of other relevant data by no later than  30 June of each year. The executive office or local human resources office of each  entity should ensure that completed individual official records are maintained.   11.4 The head of entity shall hold all managers and supervisors accountable for the  effective use of the Performance Management and Development System throughout  all stages of the process and shall provide advice and recommendations, where  warranted. The head of entity should ensure that the entity's priorities are  communicated to all staff members of the entity. The head of entity may also establish  performance standards for the entity as the basis for individual success criteria.   11.5 One of the functions of the senior management team of each entity should be to  assist the head of entity in establishing a performance management and development  strategy for the entity and its implementation, as outlined in section 11.1.  11.6 At least once a year, the senior management team of each entity should devote  a meeting to performance management and development. At that meeting, the team  should review staff development and career support needs in the light of strategic  human resources management issues for the entity, including training and succession  management. The team may also provide guidance on recognition of successful  performance and on addressing performance shortcomings at the entity level.         Section 12      Joint Monitoring Group    12.1 A Joint Monitoring Group shall be established by each entity or by region or  duty station outside Headquarters. The members of the Group shall be appointed by  the head of entity. The Group shall normally consist of two members nominated by  management, two members nominated by the staff of the entity, in accordance with  local practice, and a Chair selected by the head of entity in consultation with the staff.  Each member shall serve for a two-year renewable term.  12.2 Each Joint Monitoring Group shall monitor and review the implementation of  the Performance Management and Development System by the entities concerned  with respect to the timeliness of the process and compliance with its purpose and  procedures, as provided in section 2. Joint Monitoring Groups shall work with the  respective entities to support the institutionalization of the Performance Management  and Development System. The Joint Monitoring Group may request from the heads  of entity statistical information necessary for the discharge of its functions. The Office  of Human Resources may provide ex officio support through the provision of such  information or the preparation of consolidated reports.   ST/AI/2021/4      21-11428  10/13    12.3 The Joint Monitoring Group shall meet once a year, at the end of the  performance cycle. It shall report to the Global Joint Monitoring Group no later than  31 July of each year. Joint Monitoring Group reports shall include a compliance  review of the end-of-year appraisals and an overall summary of the Performance  Management and Development System implementation process in each entity for that  year.        Section 13      Global Joint Monitoring Group    13.1 The Global Joint Monitoring Group shall be a subsidiary body of the Staff- Management Coordination Committee. It shall be composed of two members  nominated by management, two nominated by the staff and a Chair appointed after  staff consultation by the President of the Staff-Management Coordination Committee.  Each member shall serve for a one-year renewable term.  13.2 The Global Joint Monitoring Group shall meet once a year, immediately prior  to the annual meeting of the Staff-Management Coordination Committee. It shall  examine policy issues related to the implementation of the Performance Management  and Development System across the Organization. It shall review the reports  submitted by Joint Monitoring Groups and shall prepare an annual report on the  implementation of the Performance Management and Development System in the  various entities. The report shall include recommendations regarding the  implementation and overall effectiveness of the Performance Management and  Development System and shall be submitted to the Staff-Management Coordination  Committee for transmittal to the Secretary-General.         Section 14      Rebuttal panels     14.1 In consultation with the staff representatives of the entities concerned, the head  of entity or his or her representative shall draw up a list of rebuttal panel members  composed of three groups of staff members from the entity concerned, in equal  numbers. The list shall be composed as follows:    (a)  Rebuttal panel members designated by the head of entity;    (b)  Rebuttal panel members designated by the staff representatives of the  entity in accordance with local practice;    (c)  Rebuttal panel Chairs selected by the head of entity after consultation with  the staff representatives of that entity.   The approved list, subdivided as indicated above, shall normally comprise nine  individuals for large entities and six for smaller entities. However, if an entity  determines that a larger membership pool is needed, it may expand the membership  by adding one or more members to each of the groups specified above. Every effort  shall be made to obtain an appropriate geographical and gender balance, where  possible. Members must have adequate knowledge and the experience required to  review the appraisal and its rating. The head of entity shall inform the staff in writing  of the composition of the approved list.  14.2 Rebuttal panel members shall serve for a two-year term. Should a member of  the rebuttal panel be assigned to functions outside the entity concerned, the panel  member shall be replaced in accordance with the procedure relevant to the group to  which the rebuttal panel member belongs.  14.3 If it is not possible to constitute a list from the staff members of that entity, the  approved list may include staff members of other entities at the same duty station,    ST/AI/2021/4    11/13  21-11428    provided that those staff members have the knowledge and experience required to  review the appraisal and its rating.        Section 15      Rebuttal process    15.1 Staff members who disagree with a ""partially meets performance expectations""  or a ""does not meet performance expectations"" rating received at the end of the  performance cycle may, within 14 days of signing the completed performance  document, submit to the relevant Executive Officer at Headquarters, or to the Chief  of Administration/Chief of Mission Support, as applicable, a written rebuttal  statement setting forth briefly the specific reasons that a higher overall rating should  have been received. Staff members who have received the rating of ""consistently  exceeds  performance  expectations""  or  ""successfully  meets  performance  expectations"" cannot initiate a rebuttal.  15.2 The rebuttal statement shall contain the names of the three individuals, one from  each of the three groups identified in section 14.1, whom the staff member has  selected to serve on the rebuttal panel, each of whose grade is equal to or higher than  that of the reporting officer whose evaluation or comments are being rebutted.   15.3 After receiving a copy of the rebuttal statement, the head of entity or his or her  representative shall, within 14 days, prepare and submit to the rebuttal panel a brief  written statement in reply to the rebuttal statement submitted by the staff member. A  copy of the reply to the rebuttal statement shall be given to the staff member. Unless  geographical location makes it impractical, the panel shall hear the staff member, the  first and second reporting officers and, at the discretion of the panel, other individuals  who may have information relevant to the review of the appraisal rating. Telephone  statements may also be taken where geographical separation so dictates.   15.4 The rebuttal panel shall prepare, within 14 days of the review of the case, a brief  report setting forth the reasons that the original rating should or should not be  maintained. In the event that an overall rating should not be maintained, the rebuttal  panel should designate the new rating on the performance evaluation. The report of  the rebuttal panel shall be placed in the staff member's official status file as an  attachment to the completed performance document.  15.5 The performance rating resulting from the rebuttal process shall be binding on  the head of entity and on the staff member concerned, subject to the ultimate authority  of the Secretary-General as Chief Administrative Officer of the Organization, who  may review the matter as needed on the basis of the record. Any change in the final  rating, as well as the date of the decision, shall be communicated to the Office of  Human Resources, with an annotation that the rating was changed as a result of a  review of the performance management and development rebuttal and including the  final rating recommended by the rebuttal panel.  15.6 Should unsatisfactory performance be the basis for a decision of non-renewal of  an appointment, and should the appointment expire before the end of the rebuttal  process, the appointment should be renewed for the duration necessary for the  completion of the rebuttal process.  15.7 The rating resulting from an evaluation that has not been rebutted is final and  not subject to appeal. However, administrative decisions that stem from any final  performance appraisal and that affect the conditions of service of a staff member may  be resolved through informal or formal justice mechanisms.

The determination that service is satisfactory with respect to performance, as well as  the procedures for withholding a salary increment when such a determination cannot  be made, are governed by the provisions of the present section.  16.2 The decision to award or withhold a salary increment on the basis of  performance shall be made by the second reporting officer on the basis of the rating  awarded by the first reporting officer as reflected in the performance document.  16.3 The following ratings, as specified in section 9.3, shall justify a determination  that awarding a salary increment is warranted:    * Exceeds performance expectations     * Successfully meets performance expectations  16.4 The following ratings, as specified in section 9.3, shall justify a determination  that awarding a salary increment is not warranted:    * Partially meets performance expectations     * Does not meet performance expectations  16.5 When a salary increment is withheld owing to the rating ""partially meets  performance expectations"", the increment shall be withheld pending the outcome of  a performance improvement plan. If the staff member's performance improves  following the completion of the performance improvement plan, the staff member  shall be granted the salary increment with effect from the date of successful  completion of the performance improvement plan.  16.6 The decision to withhold a salary increment shall be communicated to the staff  member in writing before the decision is implemented, with a copy provided to the  Office of Human Resources or, in the case of offices away from Headquarters and  regional commissions, to the local human resources office.   16.7 Should the Performance Management and Development System rating on the  basis of which a salary increment has been withheld be upgraded at a later stage as a  result of the rebuttal process described in section 15, and should the new rating justify  the award of the salary increment, the increment shall be awarded and made effective  as from the date on which it would otherwise have been paid.         Section 17      Performance Management and Development System e-forms, learning  materials and guidelines    17.1 The Performance Management and Development System e-forms, learning  materials and guidelines are available to staff members on the intranet and through  their relevant executive office or local human resources office.

"accountability","UNITED UNITED ST NATIONS NATIONS Secretariat ST/AI/401 18 January 1995 ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTION To: Members of the staff From: The Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management Subject: PERSONNEL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES 1. Consistent with the desire of the General Assembly, expressed in its resolution 48/218 B of 29 July 1994, for the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) to exercise operational independence under the authority of the Secretary-General in the conduct of its duties, the Secretary-General defined in bulletin ST/SGB/273 the scope of the authority of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services in personnel matters, as follows: (a) In keeping with the need for operational independence, the Under- Secretary-General shall, through appropriate arrangements of delegation of authority, exercise the degree of latitude and control over the personnel and resources of the Office, consistent with the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, that is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Office; (b) With respect to the staff of the Office, the Under-Secretary-General shall have powers of appointment, promotion and termination similar to those delegated by the Secretary-General to the heads of programmes, funds or subsidiary organs enjoying special status in these matters. Contracts of staff members appointed by the Under-Secretary-General shall be limited to service with the Office. Staff members holding regular United Nations appointments who are selected to serve with the Office shall retain their current status and their acquired rights under the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. 2. The purpose of the present instruction is to outline the administrative arrangements and the authority of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services in personnel matters. 95-01551 (E) 200195 /... ST/AI/401 Page 2 3. The Staff Regulations adopted by the General Assembly and the Staff Rules and administrative instructions promulgated by the Secretary-General pursuant thereto will apply to staff members serving with the Office in the same manner as they do to the rest of the Secretariat. 4. Staff members presently serving with the Office who were appointed by the Secretary-General on the recommendation of the United Nations appointment and promotion machinery on permanent or fixed-term appointments will continue to be governed by the terms of appointment and conditions of service specified in their letters of appointment. Their acquired rights and eligibility for reassignment within the Secretariat will not be affected. 5. Subject to the retention by the Secretary-General of his authority to promulgate and interpret the Staff Regulations and Rules and to take final decisions in appeals and disciplinary cases under the Staff Regulations and in compensation claims under Appendix D of the Staff Rules, full authority is delegated to the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services by the Secretary-General as specified below, thus giving the Under-Secretary-General the responsibility for administering, in the name of the Secretary-General, the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules in respect of staff members serving with the Office. 6. To this end, the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Under- Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services, will establish an OIOS Appointment and Promotion Panel to advise the Under-Secretary-General on the appointment, promotion and termination of all staff members up to and including the D-2 level. The Panel will consist of three members and three alternates: a chairperson to be nominated by the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services, a member nominated by the staff of the Office and a senior staff member from the Department of Administration and Management. The Office of Human Resources Management will be represented ex officio. The functions and procedures of the Panel will be generally comparable to those of other United Nations appointment and promotion bodies. Secretariat policies, including the special measures to improve the status of women in the Secretariat, will apply. 7. Staff members for the Office will be recruited specifically for service with the Office rather than with the Secretariat as a whole. Their letters of appointment will indicate that their services are limited to the Office. Such staff members will be regarded as external candidates in filling vacancies in other departments. Movements of such staff members between the Office and other parts of the Secretariat will be subject to the same conditions and arrangements as are applicable to staff members serving with voluntarily funded programmes of the United Nations. 8. The principle of recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible will govern the appointment of Professional staff members. Such staff members will be reported separately to the General Assembly in the Secretary-General's annual report on the composition of the Secretariat. 9. Thus, in accordance with the relevant staff rules, the Under-Secretary- General for Internal Oversight Services will have authority to appoint all staff members whose appointments are limited to service with the Office up to the /... ST/AI/401 Page 3 D-2 level, to promote staff members up to the D-1 level, and to terminate appointments of such staff members, except for termination under article X of the Staff Regulations, but including terminations for unsatisfactory services, with the advice of the OIOS Appointment and Promotion Panel. 10. Staff members of the Office will be recruited and administered by the Office of Human Resources Management on behalf of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services. The provisions of bulletin ST/SGB/213/Rev.1, concerning designation of staff members performing significant functions in financial management, personnel management and general services administration, shall be applicable to the Office. 11. The administrative bodies established by the Secretary-General to advise him on staff matters, such as the Joint Appeals Board, the Joint Disciplinary Committee, the Claims Board and the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims, will have jurisdiction as regards all staff members serving with the Office. ----- "

ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  8/20       Rule 104.2       (a)  The Secretary-General shall prepare part  one, the plan outline, reflecting the longer-term  objectives of the Organization.     (b)  The Secretary-General shall prepare part  two, the biennial programme plan, to cover two years.     (c)  Instructions shall be issued in accordance  with the present Regulations and Rules for the  formulation of strategic framework proposals. Heads  of departments (as defined in financial rule 101.3 (c))  and offices shall submit to the Secretary-General  proposals for the programmes falling within their  area(s) of competence, in such detail, at such time  and through such channels as the Secretary-General  may require.     (d)  The Secretary-General shall establish a  timetable in order to guarantee the submission of the  proposed strategic framework and its revisions to the  Committee for Programme and Coordination, in  accordance with the six-week documentation rule, no  later than the end of April.          Regulation 4.2         The strategic framework shall be a translation  of legislative mandates into programmes and  subprogrammes. Its objectives and strategies shall be  derived from the policy orientations and goals set by  the intergovernmental organs. It shall clearly reflect  Member States' priorities as set out in legislation  adopted by functional and regional intergovernmental  bodies within their spheres of competence and by the  General Assembly, on advice from the Committee for  Programme and Coordination.        Rule 104.3       (a)  Requests and directives to the Secretary- General contained in resolutions or decisions of relevant  intergovernmental organs constitute legislative mandates  for proposed activities. Legislation establishing an  organizational unit or providing the general mandate for  work in an area should not be cited unless it is the only  mandate for the activities proposed.     (b)  Only United Nations intergovernmental  organs are competent to provide a legislative mandate.  Decisions or conclusions of intergovernmental organs  that are not organs of the United Nations may become a  mandate after they are endorsed by an intergovernmental  organ of the United Nations.     (c)  Unless it mandates continuing functions of  the Organization, a legislative mandate adopted more  than five years before the strategic framework review  should be accompanied by an explanation justifying its  retention as a mandate.     (d)  New activities that may be proposed by the  Secretary-General in fulfilment of the general objectives  of the Organization shall be given a legislative mandate  through the adoption of the strategic framework by the  General Assembly.          Regulation 4.3         The strategic framework and the budget outline  shall together form the basis for preparation of the  proposed programme budget.          Regulation 4.4         The strategic framework shall cover all  activities, both substantive and servicing, including  those to be financed partially or fully from  extrabudgetary and other assessed resources.        Rule 104.4       Strategic framework proposals shall be submitted  to the General Assembly through the Committee for  Programme and Coordination.          Regulation 4.5         The strategic framework shall be presented by  programme and subprogramme. There shall be  congruence,  to  the  extent  possible,  of  the  programmatic and organizational structure of the  Secretariat. Each programme shall contain a  narrative identifying the mandates that provide the  overall orientation for the programme. Each  subprogramme shall contain a narrative, which  should reflect all mandated activities and identify  objectives  of  the  Organization,  expected  accomplishments of the Secretariat and indicators of  achievement and strategies to be used during the  plan period to contribute to the achievement of the  expected accomplishments and objectives.        Rule 104.5       (a)  Each programme of the strategic framework  shall be presented in a separate chapter and shall contain  subprogrammes where appropriate.     ST/SGB/2018/3    9/20  18-08803      (b)  The subprogramme structure of the strategic  framework shall determine the subprogramme structure  of the programme budgets for the biennium.     (c)  The subprogramme structure shall, to the  extent possible, correspond to an organizational unit,  normally at the divisional level. The General Assembly  may modify the subprogramme structure of the  programme budget when it adopts the programme budget.     (d)  For substantive activities:     (i)  Each  programme  shall  contain  an  introductory narrative describing the relationship  of planned activities to the overall strategy  reflected in the decisions of the General Assembly  for the period covered by the strategic framework  and the rationale for selecting the objectives and  the subprogrammes intended to attain them. Such  an analysis should take into account the situation  in the sector in question, the problems that had  been identified and the progress made by the  international community towards solving those  problems. The narrative shall describe the actions  expected  from  both  Member  States  and  international organizations, as well as the linkages  with other programmes;     (ii)  The subprogramme shall be the main unit of  analysis, review and evaluation in the United  Nations planning and programming system.          Regulation 4.6         Part one of the strategic framework shall be the  plan outline, which will constitute a key integral  element of the planning process. The plan outline  shall be derived from legislative mandates set by  intergovernmental organs, shall identify future  challenges and shall:     (a)  Highlight in a coordinated manner the  policy orientation of the United Nations;     (b)  Indicate the longer-term objectives and  strategy and the trends deduced from mandates that  reflect priorities set by intergovernmental organs as  well as future challenges;     (c)  Contain the Secretary-General's proposals  on priorities.          Regulation 4.7         The strategic framework shall cover a two-year  period and shall be submitted to the General  Assembly one year before the submission of the  proposed programme budget covering the same two- year period.          Regulation 4.8         The programmes and subprogrammes of the  proposed strategic framework shall be reviewed by  the relevant sectoral, functional and regional  intergovernmental bodies, if possible during the  regular cycle of their meetings, prior to their review  by the Committee for Programme and Coordination,  the Economic and Social Council and the General  Assembly. The Committee for Programme and  Coordination shall consider the proposed strategic  framework in accordance with its terms of reference.        Rule 104.6       (a)  Programme managers shall prepare, in  conformity with the present Regulations and Rules and  the instructions issued by the Secretary-General, and  under the policy guidance of the heads of departments  and offices, a draft of their portions of the strategic  framework.     (b)  Programme managers shall draft their  portions of the strategic framework in time for them to  be reviewed by the organs referred to in regulations 4.8  and 4.9.     (c)  When those organs are considering the  proposed strategic framework, the Secretariat shall draw  their attention to the provisions of the present  Regulations and Rules.     (d)  After this review has been completed,  programme  managers  shall  send  the  following  documents to the Office of Programme Planning,  Budget and Accounts:     (i)  The draft strategic framework as presented to  the relevant body;     (ii)  That part of the report of the body covering  its review of the draft strategic framework and its  recommendations for changes;     (iii) The redrafted strategic framework reflecting  those recommendations where appropriate.     (e)  When the above-mentioned documents have  been received, the narratives of the programmes and  subprogrammes will be adjusted to incorporate changes  needed to ensure coherence, improve coordination and  avoid overlap. The formulation of the proposed strategic  framework shall be supervised by the Management  Committee.   ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  10/20      (f)  The proposed strategic framework will then  be issued in fascicles as a General Assembly document  and made available to the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, the Economic and Social Council and  the General Assembly.     (g)  The strategic framework, as approved by the  General Assembly, will be printed as a single document.          Regulation 4.9         The participation of sectoral, functional and  regional organs in the formulation of the strategic  framework shall be achieved by means of an  appropriate preparation period. To that end, the  Secretary-General shall provide proposals for the  coordination of their calendars of meetings. The  activities in the strategic framework shall be  coordinated with those of the concerned specialized  agencies through prior consultations.        Rule 104.7       The Secretary-General shall take appropriate  measures to submit proposals to the sectoral, functional  and regional bodies to enable them to review the  relevant portions of the strategic framework or its  revisions with a view to facilitating their consideration  by the Committee for Programme and Coordination and  the General Assembly.          Regulation 4.10         The General Assembly shall consider the  proposed strategic framework in the light of the  comments and recommendations of the Economic  and  Social  Council  and  the  Committee  for  Programme and Coordination. The Assembly shall  decide to accept, curtail, reformulate or reject each  of the subprogrammes proposed in the strategic  framework.          Regulation 4.11         After its adoption by the General Assembly, the  strategic framework shall constitute the principal  policy directive of the United Nations and shall serve  as the basis for programme planning, budgeting,  monitoring and evaluation. The strategic framework  will comprise:     (a)  Part one: a plan outline, reflecting the  longer-term objectives of the Organization;     (b)  Part two: a biennial programme plan to  cover two years.   The strategic framework will also contain a  description of the strategies to be followed and the  methods to be used.        Rule 104.8       In the subprogrammes of the proposed strategic  framework:     (a)  Objectives for Secretariat action shall be, to  the greatest extent possible, concrete and time-limited.  Achievement  of  the  objectives  and  expected  accomplishments should be verifiable either directly or  through evaluation. Indicators of achievement should be  given where possible;     (b)  When an objective for Secretariat action  cannot be achieved by the end of the plan period, both  this longer-term objective and more specific objective(s)  to be achieved within the plan period shall be set;     (c)  The strategy for the subprogrammes shall  describe the course of action, the type of activities to be  carried out (research, technical assistance, support of  negotiations, etc.) and the programme framework within  which the budget will be prepared, which can be  expected to result in the fulfilment of the objectives set;     (d)  The strategy shall briefly describe the  situation that is expected to have been reached at the  beginning of the plan period and the approach that will  be taken during the plan period to achieve the objective;     (e)  The objectives and strategy shall encompass  all activities proposed within a subprogramme.          Regulation 4.12         Sectoral, functional and regional programme- formulating organs shall refrain from undertaking  new activities that are not programmed in the  strategic framework unless a pressing need of an  unforeseeable nature arises, as determined by the  General Assembly.          Regulation 4.13         The  Committee  for  Programme  and  Coordination, in performing its programmatic role  in the planning and budgeting process, shall review  the programmatic aspects of the new and/or revised  mandates approved by the General Assembly  subsequent to the adoption of the biennial programme  plan, as well as any differences that arise between the    ST/SGB/2018/3    11/20  18-08803    biennial programme plan and the programmatic  aspects of the proposed programme budget. All  revisions proposed by the Secretary-General shall be  as detailed as  necessary to  incorporate the  programme implications of the resolutions and  decisions adopted by intergovernmental organs and  international conferences since the adoption of the  biennial programme plan.        Rule 104.9       (a)  Revisions to the strategic framework are  required, inter alia:     (i)  When intergovernmental mandates adopted  after the adoption of the strategic framework call  for new or substantially modified programmes and  subprogrammes or any other revisions that should  be properly identified;     (ii)  When the programme mandates in the opinion  of the Secretary-General have become obsolete;     (iii) When  the  Secretary-General  deems it  necessary to propose new activities at the  subprogramme level not covered by existing  legislative mandates.     (b)  Substantive revisions shall be those which  propose a change in the objective(s) or the strategy of  the programme or subprogramme.          Regulation 4.14         The establishment of priorities among both  substantive programmes and common support  services shall form an integral part of the general  planning and management process without prejudice  to arrangements and procedures now in force or to  the specific character of servicing activities. Such  priorities shall be based on the importance of the  objective to Member States, the Organization's  capacity to achieve it and the real effectiveness and  usefulness of the results.          Regulation 4.15         Specialized  intergovernmental  and  expert  bodies, when reviewing the relevant programmes of  the strategic framework within their sphere of  competence, shall refrain from establishing priorities  that are not consistent with the overall priorities  established in the strategic framework.          Regulation 4.16         The priorities, as determined by the General  Assembly, established in the strategic framework  shall guide the allocation of budgetary and  extrabudgetary  resources  in  the  subsequent  programme budgets. After the strategic framework  has been adopted by the Assembly, the Secretary- General shall bring the decisions on priorities to the  attention of Member States and the governing boards  of the voluntary funds.        Rule 104.10       The allocation of resources proposed by the  Secretary-General in the subsequent programme budgets  shall be made in accordance with regulations 3.2 and 5.1  to 5.9.          Article V      Programme aspects of the budget          Regulation 5.1         The budget outline shall be submitted and  considered for approval by the General Assembly  after consideration and adoption of the strategic  framework. After their approval by the Assembly,  the strategic framework and the budget outline shall  together form the basis for preparation of the  proposed programme budget. In order to facilitate  this relationship, the programme budget shall have  financial information at the programme and  subprogramme levels.        Rule 105.1       As provided in rule 104.5 (b), the subprogramme  structure of the programme budget shall be identical to  that of the strategic framework unless a change in the  subprogramme structure has been authorized by a  subsequent legislative mandate. The financial data  provided in the proposed programme budget shall be  linked to the strategic framework at the programme and  subprogramme levels. At the subprogramme level,  estimates of the required resources, expressed as a  percentage of the programme resources, shall be  provided.          Regulation 5.2         The programme proposals set out in the budget  shall aim at achieving the objectives established in  the strategic framework. Programme proposals that  ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  12/20    are not derived from the objectives shall be  submitted only as a result of legislation passed  subsequent to the adoption of the strategic  framework or its latest revision.        Rule 105.2       No activity or output shall be included in the  proposed programme budget unless it is clearly in  implementation of the strategic framework strategy and  is likely to help to achieve the objectives of the strategic  framework, or it is in implementation of legislation  passed subsequent to the approval or revision of the  strategic framework.          Regulation 5.3         In the proposed programme budget, the  requested resources shall be justified in terms of the  requirements of output delivery in contributing to  the expected accomplishments.        Rule 105.3       For all activities, programme budget submissions  provided to the Secretary-General will include, at the  appropriate level of detail, data on the resources  required, such as requirements for posts, travel,  consultants and other relevant objects of expenditure.  These data will be used in internal budget formulation  procedures as a basis for programme budget proposals.  The programme narrative describing servicing activities  shall include, wherever possible, quantitative indicators  measuring the services rendered and showing any  expected change in productivity during the biennium.          Regulation 5.4         The proposed programme budget shall be  divided into parts, sections and programmes.  Programme narratives shall set out subprogrammes,  outputs, objectives and accomplishments expected  during the biennium. The proposed programme  budget shall be preceded by a statement explaining  the main changes made in the content of the  programme and the volume of resources allocated to  it in relation to the previous biennium. The proposed  programme budget shall be accompanied by such  information, annexes and explanatory statements as  may be requested by or on behalf of the General  Assembly and such further annexes or statements as  the Secretary-General may deem necessary and  useful.        Rule 105.4       (a)  The programme narratives for all activities  shall conform to the following standards:     (i)  All final outputs included in the proposed  programme budget shall clearly contribute to the  achievement  of  a  subprogramme  objective  identified in the strategic framework;     (ii)  Output descriptions shall conform to the  following standard categories of final output:       a.  Servicing of intergovernmental and  expert bodies, including reports thereto;       b.  Other substantive activities;       c.  International  cooperation  and  inter-agency coordination and liaison;       d.  Conference services;       e.  Technical cooperation;       f.  Administrative support services;     (iii) Expected  accomplishments  shall  be  formulated for each subprogramme and shall  identify those benefits or changes expected to  accrue to users or beneficiaries through the delivery  of final outputs. Expected accomplishments shall  be in conformity with and lead to the fulfilment of  the objectives established in the programmes and  subprogrammes. Expected accomplishments shall  be expressed in terms that will facilitate the  subsequent  determination  of  whether  the  expectations  have  been  met.  Expected  accomplishments shall be objective, feasible and  pertinent to the nature of and the work carried out  by each subprogramme.     (b)  The programme narratives for servicing  activities shall identify the services to be delivered by  nature and quantity. Wherever possible, standard  categories of services shall be established.          Regulation 5.5         All activities for which resources are requested  in the proposed programme budget shall be  programmed.        Rule 105.5       All activities, whether financed from regular budget  or extrabudgetary resources, shall be programmed in the  sense that:     ST/SGB/2018/3    13/20  18-08803      (a)  Output descriptions as stipulated under rule  105.4 shall apply, irrespective of the resources used for  producing the output;     (b)  Financial information as stipulated under  rule 105.3 shall be provided in internal budget  formulation data for both categories of funds.          Regulation 5.6         Within the proposed programme budget, the  Secretary-General shall submit to the General  Assembly, with justification, a list of outputs  included in the previous budgetary period which, in  the judgement of the Secretary-General, can be  discontinued and which, as a consequence, have not  been included in the proposed programme budget.        Rule 105.6       In  their  budgetary  submissions,  heads  of  departments and offices shall provide the Secretary- General with a list of outputs and activities required by  legislation or approved in a previous budgetary period  that have not been included in the proposed programme  budget because they are considered obsolete, of  marginal usefulness or ineffective, and that therefore  could be proposed for termination by the General  Assembly. The determination of such outputs shall be  made by applying, inter alia, the following criteria:     (a)  Outputs  and  activities  derived  from  mandates that are at least five years old, unless a  relevant intergovernmental body has reaffirmed the  continuing validity of the mandate;     (b)  Outputs and activities whose legislative  basis has been superseded by new mandates;     (c)  Outputs and activities that were programmed  as new outputs in the budget for the previous biennium  but that were not implemented in that biennium; if such  outputs are to be included in the budget, justification  must be provided;     (d)  Outputs and activities that, during the  in-depth evaluation of a programme by the Committee  for Programme and Coordination or a review of the  programme by the relevant functional or regional  intergovernmental organ, were found to be obsolete, of  marginal usefulness or ineffective.          Regulation 5.7         The  Secretary-General  shall  provide  the  Committee for Programme and Coordination and  the Advisory Committee on Administrative and  Budgetary Questions with advance copies of the  proposed programme budget by the end of April of  the year preceding the budgetary period.        Rule 105.7       (a)  Heads of departments and offices shall  submit programme proposals and corresponding budget  estimates at such time and in such detail as the  Secretary-General may prescribe and in accordance with  the present Regulations and Rules.     (b)  Taking into account the deliberations of the  Management Committee, the Secretary-General shall  decide on the programme content and resource allocation  of the budget to be submitted to the General Assembly.     (c)  The programmes of work submitted by  programme managers to specialized intergovernmental  organs should contain activities and output specifications  identical to those set out in the programme portion of  the proposed programme budget. This does not preclude  the addition of further information and detail if required  by the specialized intergovernmental organs.          Regulation 5.8         The  Committee  for  Programme  and  Coordination shall review the proposed programme  budget to ensure that the narratives of the  programme budget fascicles are identical to the  approved biennial programme plan and report on its  deliberations. The report of the Committee shall be  communicated to the General Assembly and the  Economic and Social Council for their consideration.          Regulation 5.9         No council, commission or other competent  body shall take a decision involving either a change  in the programme budget approved by the General  Assembly or the possible requirement of expenditure  unless it has received and taken account of a report  from the Secretary-General on the programme  budget implications of the proposal.        Rule 105.8       It shall be the responsibility of the head of the  department concerned, in consultation with the Office of  Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, to ensure  that a report on programme budget implications, as  required by regulation 5.9, is submitted to the General  Assembly prior to its adoption of any resolution or  ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  14/20    decision. The report should integrate the programme,  financial and administrative implications of draft  resolutions and include the following information:     (a)  Modifications of the work programme that  would be necessary should the proposed draft  resolution, recommendation or decision be adopted,  listing additions, changes or deletions to programmes,  subprogrammes, outputs and activities;     (b)  Indications, where applicable, of similar or  closely related work being carried out elsewhere in the  Secretariat and, if possible, indications of related  activities being conducted in the specialized agencies of  the United Nations system;     (c)  In cases where it is proposed to finance such  additional activities totally or partly through the  redeployment of existing resources, an indication of the  outputs or subprogrammes in the current work  programme that would be changed, curtailed or  terminated as a consequence.          Article VI      Monitoring of  programme implementation          Regulation 6.1         The  Secretary-General  shall  monitor  accomplishments by subprogramme, as measured by  indicators of achievement and the delivery of outputs  scheduled in the approved programme budget,  through the Department of Management. After the  completion of the biennial budget period, the  Secretary-General shall report to the General  Assembly, through the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, on programme performance  during that period.        Rule 106.1       (a)  The Department of Management shall:     (i)  Monitor changes made during the biennium  in the programme of work set out in the programme  budget approved by the General Assembly;     (ii)  At the end of the biennium, report on the  actual progress made towards achieving expected  accomplishments, as measured by the indicators,  and towards delivery of final outputs, in  comparison with the commitments set out in the  programme narratives of the approved programme  budget and report thereon to the General Assembly  through the Committee for Programme and  Coordination. This monitoring and performance  reporting shall cover all activities in the  programme budget.     (b)  Programme performance shall be reported in  accordance with the following procedures:     (i)  Heads of departments and offices shall  submit biennial programme performance reports  for their departments at such time and in such  detail as the Secretary-General may prescribe;     (ii)  The Department of Management shall be  responsible for reporting on programme delivery  and preparing the related report to the General  Assembly.     (c)  The Office of Internal Oversight Services  shall conduct ad hoc detailed audits of programme and  output delivery.     (d)  In the programme performance report, final  outputs shall be listed according to the following  categories:     (i)  Completed as programmed;     (ii)  Postponed to the following biennium,  whether commenced or not;     (iii) Completed but significantly reformulated;     (iv) Terminated  as  obsolete,  of  marginal  usefulness or ineffective;     (v)  Additional output required by a legislative  decision subsequent to the approval of the  programme budget;     (vi) Additional output initiated by the programme  manager.   An implementation rate based on the above categories  shall be assigned to each programme in the programme  performance report. Explanations shall be provided in the  programme performance report for low implementation  rates and, upon the request of Member States, for any  other departures from programmed commitments.     (e)  In the programme performance report, the  assessment of progress against objectives and expected  accomplishments required under rule 106.1 (a) (ii) shall  be provided, to the extent possible, by subprogramme.  An explanation shall be given for lack of progress.          Regulation 6.2         An  entire  subprogramme  shall  not  be  reformulated nor a new programme introduced in  the programme budget without the prior approval of    ST/SGB/2018/3    15/20  18-08803    an intergovernmental body and the General  Assembly. The Secretary-General may make such  proposals  for  review  by  the  relevant  intergovernmental body if he or she considers that  circumstances so warrant.        Rule 106.2       Programme implementation shall be monitored  under the following procedures:     (a)  Heads of departments or offices shall  establish internal programme-monitoring procedures  pursuant to guidelines established by the Department of  Management;     (b)  Within  any  subprogramme,  heads  of  departments or offices shall have the discretion with full  justification to modify the approved programme budget  by reformulating final outputs, postponing delivery of  outputs to the following biennium or terminating outputs,  provided that such changes are in pursuance of the  objective and strategy of the subprogramme as set out in  the strategic framework. Such proposed changes shall  be reported through the Department of Management;     (c)  Subject to the procedures established under  (a) and (b) above, changes in the programme of work  mandated by a competent intergovernmental organ that  can be implemented within existing resources may be  implemented by the department or office concerned;     (d)  Changes in the programme of work requiring  net additional resources may not be implemented before  they are approved by the General Assembly.          Regulation 6.3         The Secretary-General shall transmit the  biennial programme performance report to all  Member States by the end of the first quarter  following the completion of the biennial budgetary  period.          Article VII      Evaluation          Regulation 7.l         The objective of evaluation is:     (a)  To  determine  as  systematically  and  objectively as possible the relevance, efficiency,  effectiveness and impact of the Organization's  activities in relation to their objectives;     (b)  To enable the Secretariat and Member  States to engage in systematic reflection, with a view  to  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  the  main  programmes of the Organization by altering their  content and, if necessary, reviewing their objectives.        Rule 107.1       (a)  The  objectives  of  a  programme  or  subprogramme shall be the standards against which its  relevance, effectiveness and impact will be assessed. As  a necessary component of programme evaluation there  shall be an assessment of the relevance, quality and  usefulness of individual output and the effectiveness of  the output in achieving the time-limited subprogramme  objectives.     (b)  Baseline data and indicators of achievement  shall be utilized in the evaluation process to assess  programme impact in terms of the objectives. An  attempt shall be made to identify and analyse the factors  associated with effectiveness and impact.     (c)  Evaluation findings shall be communicated  to Member States through intergovernmental bodies and  to heads of departments and offices in order to facilitate  the reconsideration of existing mandates, policies,  strategies and objectives, the substantive content of  programmes and its utility to the users.          Regulation 7.2         All activities programmed shall be evaluated  over a fixed time period. An evaluation programme  as well as a timetable for intergovernmental review  of evaluation studies shall be proposed by the  Secretary-General and approved by the General  Assembly at the same time as the proposed strategic  framework.        Rule 107.2       (a)  All programmes shall be evaluated on a  regular,  periodic  basis. At  the  programme  or  subprogramme level, evaluation plans shall be linked to  the strategic framework, and they shall be integrated  with the programme budget cycle.     (b)  The evaluation system shall include periodic  self-evaluation of activities directed at time-limited  objectives  and  continuing  functions.  Programme  managers shall, in collaboration with their staff,  undertake self-evaluation of all subprogrammes under  their responsibility. Specifically:     (i)  The timing, scope and other characteristics  of a self-evaluation study shall be determined by  ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  16/20    the nature and characteristics of the activities  programmed and other relevant factors;     (ii)  Methodological support shall be provided by  the Central Evaluation Unit in connection with the  preparation of self-evaluation reports;     (iii) Evaluation plans, which are required for  each new and ongoing subprogramme, shall be  prepared by programme managers and shall  contain the following elements: a definition of the  purpose of the evaluation and the anticipated  application of evaluation findings; the evaluation  methodology to be employed; the characteristics  of the evaluation (e.g., the scope of coverage and  the period covered); the measures of change  (e.g., the nature of the progress and the impact  indicators to be employed); the means of  information  collection;  the  administrative  arrangements; and the resource requirements.     (c)  In addition to self-evaluation, the evaluation  system shall include the ad hoc in-depth evaluation of  selected programme areas or topics conducted internally  or externally at the request of intergovernmental bodies  or at the initiative of the Secretariat. In determining  whether an in-depth evaluation should be carried out,  the results of self-evaluation shall be taken into account.  Specifically:     (i)  The evaluation proposals submitted by the  Secretary-General to the General Assembly for its  approval shall include a list of programmes or  portions of programmes to be covered on a regular,  periodic basis by in-depth evaluations and a  timetable indicating the years in which the related  reports are due;     (ii)  In-depth evaluation reports to be submitted  for consideration by the Committee for Programme  and Coordination or by the intergovernmental or  expert organs directly concerned with each  programme shall be prepared by the Central  Evaluation Unit, in collaboration with the  programme managers concerned and, if necessary,  competent experts in the fields involved. The Joint  Inspection Unit may also assist in the preparation  of such reports;     (iii) At least one in-depth evaluation study shall  be undertaken each year. Such a study shall  normally be completed within two years.          Regulation 7.3         Evaluation may be internal and/or external.  The  Secretary-General  shall  develop  internal  evaluation systems and seek the cooperation of  Member States in the evaluation process, as  appropriate. Evaluation methods shall be adapted to  the nature of the programme being evaluated. The  General Assembly shall invite such bodies as it sees  fit, including the Joint Inspection Unit, to perform ad  hoc external evaluations and to report on them.        Rule 107.3       (a)  Self-evaluation shall be conducted by  programme managers in compliance with guidelines  established by the Central Evaluation Unit, which will  be responsible for quality standards, methodology, the  adaptation and transfer of evaluation information and ad  hoc studies.     (b)  The United Nations programme categories  shall be used as a reference, but the primary focus of  self-evaluation shall be on the subprogramme, outputs  and activities.     (c)  Self-evaluation reports shall be concerned  with the effectiveness and impact of subprogrammes. In  them, programme managers shall:     (i)  Assess the quality and relevance of the  outputs  of  each  subprogramme  and  their  usefulness to the users;     (ii)  Compare the situation existing at the start of  the implementation of each subprogramme and  what remains to be done in order to ascertain the  extent to which a subprogramme has attained its  objective;     (iii) Analyse the extent to which the objectives of  the programme have been attained and the impact  of the totality of subprogrammes implemented in  the context of the programme;     (iv) Identify, in the light of such findings, other  possible designs for the programme; that is,  alternative  subprogrammes  that  might  be  considered in order to improve performance in  attaining the programme objectives.     (d)  The programme evaluation system shall  utilize all information collected during the programme  performance, monitoring and reporting process but shall  remain separate and distinct from that process.     (e)  The  programme  evaluation  system  is  separate and distinct from the personnel performance  appraisal system. Since the programme evaluation  system is concerned with programme effectiveness and  impact rather than the performance of individual staff  members, no information shall be transmitted between  the two systems.     ST/SGB/2018/3    17/20  18-08803       Regulation 7.4         The findings of the intergovernmental review of  evaluations  shall  be  reflected  in  subsequent  programme  design  and  delivery  and  policy  directives. To this end, a brief report summarizing  the conclusions of the Secretary-General on all  evaluation studies conducted in the established  evaluation programme shall be submitted to the  General Assembly at the same time as the text of the  proposed strategic framework.        Rule 107.4       (a)  Evaluation findings in respect of ongoing or  continuing activities shall be directly and immediately  communicated to those responsible for programme  planning and management to permit mid-course  correction if required.     (b)  The evaluation system shall include the  monitoring of action taken on the basis of evaluation  conclusions and recommendations.     (c)  Evaluation methods shall be made consistent  and comparable so as to facilitate the adaptation and  transfer of evaluation findings among United Nations  programmes.     (d)  The reporting of evaluation results shall  include a statement on the comprehensiveness and  rigour of the evaluation process; it shall clearly  differentiate between objective evidence, professional  technical judgements and political judgements of  Member  States,  and  all  its  conclusions  and  recommendations shall be supported by such evidence  and judgements. The recommendations contained in the  report shall be unambiguous and possible to implement.     (e)  Intergovernmental or expert committees  directly  concerned  with  each  programme  shall  formulate, in connection with the evaluation reports  submitted to them, recommendations concerning  methods of implementation and shall suggest, where  appropriate, a new design for the programme, resulting  in a new set of subprogrammes. Those recommendations  shall be transmitted to the Committee for Programme  and Coordination for consideration and, in the case of  programmes concerning servicing activities, to the  Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions as well.     (f)  After considering the recommendations of  the competent intergovernmental or expert organs and  the recommendations contained in the reports prepared  by the Central Evaluation Unit, the Committee for  Programme and Coordination shall propose to the  Economic and Social Council and to the General  Assembly measures that may relate to:     (i)  Changes in procedures used in implementing  ongoing programmes;     (ii)  The  redefinition  of  the  content  of  programmes and subprogrammes.     (g)  Measures thus proposed shall be considered  either in connection with the formulation of a new plan  after study by the intergovernmental bodies concerned of  the report summarizing the conclusions of the Secretary- General on the relevant evaluation studies, as envisaged  in regulation 7.4, or in connection with a biennial  revision of the plan, as envisaged in regulation 4.13.     (h)  A summary report shall be prepared  periodically to include findings of individual reports and  general conclusions on the design of the programmes  reviewed in order to assist in the preparation of the  strategic framework.       ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  18/20    Annex        Glossary of terms         Activity. Action taken to transform inputs into outputs.     Budget year. The second year of a biennium, in which the Secretary-General  submits the proposed programme budget for the following biennium.     Common services. Common services are either conference services rendered to  Member States or administrative services rendered by a single unit to more than one  department or office.     Competent intergovernmental organ. An intergovernmental organ is competent  to provide legislative mandates to the Secretariat in the areas covered by its terms of  reference as set out in intergovernmental resolutions or decisions, normally those  establishing its existence. Such competence may be global, regional, sectoral or  functional.     Delivery of output. An output is generally considered to have been delivered  when the service is completed or when the products resulting from a programme  activity are made available to the intended primary users; e.g., in the case of a report  or a technical publication, when it has been circulated to Member States, interested  Governments or other primary users; in the case of a sales publication, when it is  placed on sale.     Effectiveness is the extent to which objectives and expected accomplishments  are achieved.     Efficiency is measured by how well inputs are converted into outputs.     End-user is the recipient or beneficiary of an output or accomplishment.     Evaluation is a process that seeks to determine as systematically and objectively  as possible the relevance, effectiveness and impact of an activity in the light of its  goals, objectives and accomplishments. Specifically:     * In-depth evaluation is undertaken by the Central Evaluation Unit at the request  of the Committee for Programme and Coordination, as endorsed by the General  Assembly, or at the request of other intergovernmental bodies. It may also be  undertaken by evaluation units in regional and sectoral secretariats at the request  of their governing bodies. This type of evaluation may also be initiated by the  Secretary-General for a particular programme as the need arises. In-depth  evaluation focuses on the programme. On the basis of studies conducted by the  relevant evaluation unit for their consideration, the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, intergovernmental bodies at the regional and sectoral levels,  other technical intergovernmental bodies and appropriate expert bodies  concerned review entire programmes or the entire work of an entity in depth.  The objective is to make recommendations that would help the Economic and  Social Council and the General Assembly to formulate decisions aimed at  increasing the overall relevance, effectiveness and impact of the programmes of  the United Nations in the context of the intergovernmental goals and policies;     * Self-evaluation is undertaken by programme managers primarily for their own  use. Self-evaluation focuses on the subprogramme and can be applied to all  sectors, including political, legal, humanitarian, economic and social affairs,  public information and common services. As an integral part of the management  process, the design and conduct of the self-evaluation procedure are specified  at the planning and programming stages in conjunction with the design of the  relevant subprogramme. Findings are applied by the programme managers to    ST/SGB/2018/3    19/20  18-08803    make necessary adjustments in implementation or are fed back into the planning  and programming process in the form of proposed changes in the design and/or  orientation of the subprogramme or project concerned. While the results of self- evaluation are not normally reported at the intergovernmental level, the  conclusions drawn from the analytical information generated for various  subprogrammes and projects within a programme can be used as inputs for  assessing the programme as a whole;     * Internal evaluation covers both self-evaluation and in-depth evaluation (see  above);     * Ongoing evaluation is the examination of an activity during its implementation  to assess its continued relevance and progress towards the achievement of its  objectives;     * Ex post evaluation is the assessment of the relevance, effectiveness and impact  of an activity carried out some time after its completion.     Expected accomplishment is a desired outcome involving benefits to end users,  expressed as a quantitative or qualitative standard, value or rate. Accomplishments  are the direct consequence or effect of the generation of outputs and lead to the  fulfilment of a certain objective.     External evaluation is performed by entities outside the United Nations  Secretariat. The General Assembly invites such bodies as it sees fit, including the  Joint Inspection Unit, to carry out this type of evaluation.     External factors are events and/or conditions that are beyond the control of those  responsible for an activity but that have an influence on the success or failure of the  activity. They may be anticipated in the form of assumptions or they may be  unanticipated.     Impact is an expression of the changes produced in a situation as the result of  an activity that has been undertaken.     Indicators of achievement are used to measure whether and/or the extent to  which the objectives and/or expected accomplishments have been achieved.  Indicators correspond either directly or indirectly to the objective or the expected  accomplishment for which they are used to measure performance. Ideally, indicators  should be strategic, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound.    Inputs are personnel and other resources necessary for producing outputs.     Intergovernmental organ. An organ is intergovernmental if its membership  consists of Governments. Thus, United Nations bodies consisting of persons serving  in their individual capacities are not intergovernmental organs, even if the persons  concerned were nominated by Governments or elected by an intergovernmental  organ.     Legislative mandate. A legislative mandate is a request for action addressed to  the Secretary-General or an executive head acting on his behalf in a resolution or  decision adopted by a competent United Nations intergovernmental organ.     Monitoring. Monitoring is the periodic determination by the head of a  department or office of the actual delivery of final outputs in comparison with the  commitments for the delivery of outputs set out in the programme budget as approved  by the General Assembly.     Objective. In programme budgeting, objective refers to an overall desired  achievement involving a process of change and aimed at meeting certain needs of  identified end users within a given period of time.   ST/SGB/2018/3      18-08803  20/20      Off-budget year. The first year of a biennium, in which the Secretary-General  submits an outline of the proposed programme budget for the following biennium.     Outputs. Outputs are final products or services delivered by a programme or  subprogramme to end users, such as reports, publications, training, servicing of  meetings, or advisory, editorial, translation or security services, which an activity is  expected to produce in order to achieve its objectives.     Priority. A priority is a preferential rating for the allocation of limited resources.  Thus, activities with the highest priority are those that would be conducted even if  total resources were significantly curtailed; activities with the lowest priority are  those that would be curtailed or terminated if all anticipated resources were not  available or if activities with a higher priority had to be commenced or expanded.     Programme. A programme consists of the activities undertaken by a department  or office.     Programme manager. A programme manager is the Secretariat official  responsible for the formulation and implementation of a programme as defined above,  normally the head of an organizational unit. For the purposes of self-evaluation,  programme managers also refer to those who are involved in the implementation of  subprogrammes, namely, the head of a division, branch or section.     Programme strategy. A programme strategy is a sequence of means of action to  be undertaken for the purpose of achieving an objective.     Relevance. Relevance is the extent to which an activity, expected  accomplishment or strategy is pertinent or significant for achieving the related  objective and the extent to which the objective is significant to the problem addressed.  Relevance is viewed in the context of the activity's design as well as in the light of  the factual situation at the time of evaluation.     Subprogramme. A subprogramme consists of activities within a programme  aimed at achieving one or a few closely related objectives as set out in the strategic  framework. The subprogramme structure shall correspond, to the extent possible, to  an organizational unit, normally at the division level.     18-08803 (E)    050618  *1808803*  "
"accountability","  United Nations    ST/AI/2010/1       Secretariat      14 January 2010    10-20984 (E)    210110  *1020984*         Administrative instruction         Reporting, retaining and disposing of honours, decorations,  favours, gifts or remuneration from governmental and  non-governmental sources        The Under-Secretary-General for Management, pursuant to section 4.2 of  Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2009/4, and for the purpose of implementing  the prohibition in staff regulation 1.2 and staff rule 1.2 against the receipt by staff of  honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration from governmental and  non-governmental sources, promulgates the following:        Section 1  Scope and purpose    1.1 Staff regulation 1.2, under its subsections (j), (k) and (l), sets out the  prohibition against staff receiving any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from governmental and non-governmental sources. Subsections (j) and  (k) of staff regulation 1.2 deal with the prohibition on acceptance from  governmental sources, and subsection (l) deals with the necessity of prior approval  by the Secretary-General for acceptance from non-governmental sources. Staff  rule 1.2, subsections (k), (l), (m), (n) and (o), covers these same matters. The text of  the relevant section of staff regulation 1.2 reads as follows:      ""Honours, gifts or remuneration      (j)  No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any Government;      (k)  If refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour or gift  from a Government would  cause embarrassment to the Organization, the staff  member may receive it on behalf of the Organization and then report and  entrust it to the Secretary-General, who will either retain it for the  Organization or arrange for its disposal for the benefit of the Organization or  for a charitable purpose;      (l)  No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any non-governmental source without first obtaining the  approval of the Secretary-General.""  ST/AI/2010/1      10-20984  2    1.2 The intended purpose of the staff regulations and rules dealing with honours,  decorations,  favours,  gifts  or  remuneration  from  governmental  and  non-governmental sources is to ensure the independence and impartiality of staff  members. The only latitude that is allowed is when prior approval of the Secretary- General is obtained to accept an honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration  from a non-governmental source. The procedure for obtaining the Secretary- General's prior approval is detailed in section 5 below.  1.3 The operational procedures for implementing this prohibition in a manner that  is true to the intent and spirit of the regulations, while recognizing the practical  realities of situations that actually occur, have been found to require a more detailed  explanation than has existed up to now. The main purpose of the present  administrative instruction, therefore, is to describe a set of procedures that  emphasizes to staff their obligations and simultaneously provides guidance to  officials responsible for the management of this matter.  1.4 The present policy and procedures relate to honours, decorations, favours, gifts  or remuneration that are offered or presented by either governmental or  non-governmental sources in the course of staff members' official duties or in  relation to staff members' status as international civil servants. In the event of doubt  as to the applicability of this policy in a given situation, staff members are expected  to seek guidance from the United Nations Ethics Office.  1.5 Staff members carrying out functions in sensitive areas such as procurement  and investment management shall be subject to higher standards as considered  necessary in relation to the discharge of their duties and responsibilities, as defined  in appropriate guidelines issued by the Organization.        Section 2  Definitions    2.1 For the purposes of this instruction, the following definitions shall apply:    (a)  Governmental source means:    (i)  Any unit of governmental authority, including any national, state, local  and municipal government;    (ii) Any intergovernmental organization; or    (iii) Any  agent  or  representative  of  a  governmental  authority  or  intergovernmental organization.    (b)  Non-governmental source means: any non-governmental organization,  academic institution or any private source. Educational institutions will be  considered as a non-governmental source.    (c)  Honour means: an award or recognition, tangible or intangible, given by  a governmental or non-governmental source. Such honours may include, inter alia,  medals, awards, plaques, certificates or scrolls.    (d)  Decoration means: an object that is awarded by a governmental or  non-governmental source to honour the recipient in a very visible manner. Such  decorations may include, inter alia, a medal, pin or ribbon.    ST/AI/2010/1   3  10-20984      (e)  Favour means: a special privilege or treatment granted to a staff member  by a governmental or non-governmental source.    (f)  Gift means: any item that has a physical form, offered to a staff member.  The term includes minor gifts of essentially nominal value, but does not include:    (i)  Participation in official functions (such as meals and diplomatic  receptions) for which staff members are invited as part of their official  functions (see staff rule 1.2 (n)). Staff members are expected to exercise  judgement and to refrain from accepting invitations that are or could be  perceived as inconsistent with the obligations and behaviour of United Nations  staff members;    (ii) Participation  in  activities  organized  by  governmental  or  non-governmental sources that has been authorized by the Secretary-General  in which the organizing entity covers the accommodation, travel and  subsistence allowance in line with that payable by the United Nations (see  staff rule 1.2 (u)).    (g)  Minor gift of essentially nominal value means: representational or  courtesy gifts of limited value that might be given to a staff member by a  governmental or non-governmental source as an expression of courtesy.    (h)  Remuneration means: any monetary compensation not associated with  approved outside occupation or employment established in section 3 of  administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/13.    (i)  Administering official means: Executive Officer or his/her equivalent in  other duty stations (e.g., Chief or Director of Administration for offices away from  headquarters, and Chief or Director of Mission Support for peacekeeping missions  and other peace operations) or another staff member designated by a head of office  to carry out the functions of an administering official.    (j)  Property management official means: the Under-Secretary-General for  Management, who is responsible for performing property management functions  pursuant to financial rule 105.20 or his/her designate.        Section 3  Obligations of staff members    3.1 When a situation presents itself in which an honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration is offered or presented to a staff member from a governmental or  non-governmental source, the appropriate response is for the staff member to  decline with an explanation that it is a requirement in accordance with the staff  member's duties and obligations as an international civil servant.  3.2 There may be other situations where the honour, decoration, favour or gift has  already been delivered or where the refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration,  favour or gift from a governmental or non-governmental source would cause  embarrassment to the Organization. In such cases, if the return of the honour,  decoration, favour or gift would cause embarrassment to the Organization, a staff  member may accept it, on behalf of the Organization, and shall promptly report and  entrust the item, irrespective of its value, to the administering official.  ST/AI/2010/1      10-20984  4    3.3 Staff members may not accept any honours, decorations, favours, gifts or  remuneration from a governmental source or from any individual or entity doing  business with, or seeking to do business with, the Organization. However, in  exceptional cases United Nations staff members may request the prior approval of  the Secretary-General for accepting honours, decorations, favours, gifts or  remuneration from a non-governmental source, as provided for in staff  regulation 1.2.  3.4 Staff members may accept on behalf of the Organization, without prior  approval from the Secretary-General, minor gifts of essentially nominal value from  a governmental or non-governmental source. In such instance, the requirement to  report and entrust the gift, as set out in section 3.2 above, shall apply, as well as the  procedure for recording, retention and disposal, as set out in section 4 below.        Section 4  Procedure for recording, retaining and disposing of minor gifts and anticipated  honours, decorations, favours, gifts and remuneration presented by  governmental and non-governmental sources    4.1 In accordance with the provisions of this administrative instruction, the  administering official shall establish and maintain a registry to record summary  information on all honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration that have  been accepted by staff members in accordance with sections 3.2 or 3.4. This register  shall contain the name and functional title of the recipient; a description of the event  that led to the honour, decoration, favour or gift that was presented; the name of the  governmental or non-governmental source; whether there is any relationship --  official or otherwise -- between the staff member and the governmental or  non-governmental source; the date of receipt; and the action taken for disposition as  described in section 4.2 below. This register shall be provided upon request to the  Under-Secretary-General for Management or to the Director of the Ethics Office.  4.2 Once the item has been recorded in the registry, and bearing in mind that any  honour, decoration, favour or gift must not be incompatible with the interests of the  Organization or give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest for the staff  member or the office concerned, the item will be disposed of or retained, in  consultation with the administering official, as detailed below:    (a)  Any honour, decoration, favour or gift from any individual or entity  doing business with or seeking to do business with the Organization shall be  promptly declined and returned;    (b)  Minor gifts of essentially nominal value may be retained by the recipient.  Those that are retained by the Organization will be dealt with in accordance with  section 4.3 below;    (c)  Any remuneration or the monetary portion of any honour, decoration,  favour or gift that is presented by a non-governmental source as a consequence of  performing United Nations duties and responsibilities should be either declined or  deposited to the Organization's bank account in consultation with the Office of the  Controller;    (d)  All other honours, decorations, favours or gifts shall be retained by the  Organization.    ST/AI/2010/1   5  10-20984    4.3 For those items retained by the Organization, the property management  official, on behalf of the Under-Secretary-General for Management, may allow the  honour, decoration or gift to be displayed or exhibited for educational, informational  or decorative purposes in any premises of the United Nations Organization. In all  other instances, the property management official shall dispose of the items,  whether individually or combined, by one of the means specified in financial rule  105.22. It will be the responsibility of the property management official to organize  the donation, sale or discarding of these items. For the purposes of disposal, the  honours, decorations and gifts that are the subject of this paragraph are not to be  considered surplus as a consequence of loss, damage or other discrepancies, and  therefore the advice of the Property Survey Board is not required. However, the  property management official may seek the advice of the Property Survey Board, as  necessary. In the event of sale, the net proceeds, after recovery of administrative  costs, shall be donated to the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize Memorial Fund,  established pursuant to Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2003/11.        Section 5  Procedure for obtaining the Secretary-General's approval to receive an honour,  decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from a non-governmental source    5.1 When a staff member becomes aware that he/she is being offered (i.e.,  considered, nominated or selected) to receive an honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from a non-governmental source, the staff member shall notify in  writing the administering official of the name and functional title of the intended  recipient; the circumstances of the proposed offer; the nature of the honour,  decoration, favour, gift or remuneration; the name and role of the source; and, if  possible, the estimated value. Pursuant to staff regulation 1.2 (j) and staff rule  1.2 (o), honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration that are offered from a  governmental source or an individual or entity doing business with or seeking to do  business with the United Nations must be promptly declined.  5.2 The administering official shall communicate this information to the Assistant  Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, who may approve, on behalf  of the Secretary-General, the acceptance of the honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from a non-governmental source. The approval or non-approval shall  then be communicated back to the administering official, who shall in turn inform  the staff member concerned. The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management may consult with the Ethics Office, as needed.  5.3 It is only in exceptional cases that the Assistant Secretary-General for Human  Resources Management will grant approval, on behalf of the Secretary-General, for  the staff member to receive and retain an honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from a non-governmental source, provided that:    (a)  It is not incompatible with the interests of the United Nations;    (b)  It is not incompatible with the staff member's status as an international  civil servant;    (c)  Any remuneration or the monetary portion of any honour, decoration,  favour or gift that is presented by a non-governmental source as a consequence of  performing United Nations duties and responsibilities should be either declined or  ST/AI/2010/1      10-20984  6    deposited to the Organization's bank account in consultation with the Office of the  Controller.  5.4 In cases where possible conflicts of interest might arise, the Ethics Office shall  be consulted.  5.5 In the event that approval is not granted, the staff member shall decline the  honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration.        Section 6  Final provisions    6.1 Information circular ST/IC/2006/31 of 16 August 2006, entitled ""Honours,  gifts or remuneration from outside sources"", is hereby abolished.  6.2 The present instruction shall enter into force on the date of its issuance.

Introduction       1.  Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations establishes the  universal standard for all staff members employed by the United Nations as the  ""highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity"". It is thus axiomatic that  these standards apply to all staff whose employment relationship derives from the  authority vested by the Charter in the Organization to employ individuals as staff  members. These basic standards are common to all staff, including those of the  separately funded and administered organs.   2.  The statutory provisions set out in the present annex are an integral part of the  Staff Regulations of the United Nations and Staff Rules, with regulations being  adopted by the General Assembly pursuant to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter  and with rules being promulgated by the Secretary-General pursuant to the authority  granted to him or her by the scope and purpose provision of the Staff Regulations.  3.  The provisions of article I of the Staff Regulations are in most parts very  general, as they must apply to all staff, including those of the separately funded  organs. Similarly, the provisions of chapter I of the Staff Rules contained in the  present annex are, for the most part, very general, as they must apply to all staff  appointed under the Staff Regulations and Rules.          Role of the commentary      4.  Each provision of the Staff Regulations and Rules set out in the present annex  is followed by a commentary. The commentary is designed to explain individual  provisions and to help staff members understand each provision by placing it into  context. It is not part of the Staff Regulations and Rules and so is not a legal norm,  nor does it have the legal force of a rule. It is, however, an official guide published  by the Secretary-General for the use of management and staff on the scope and  application of the regulations and rules contained in this annex. Staff may thus  safely rely on the commentary to guide their actions, since it provides a more  detailed understanding of and guidance on the statutory provisions and of staff  members' basic rights and obligations.   5.  In view of the need for staff to have a guide to their status, rights and duties  conveniently at hand, the present annex contains extracts from the Charter and the  Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the text of  article I of the Staff Regulations and the text of the related provisions of chapter I of  the Staff Rules, together with the explanatory commentary, as well as the text of the  2013 ""Standards of conduct for the international civil service"" proposed by the  International Civil Service Commission in its report for 2012 (A/67/30 and Corr.1)  and approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/257 (the ""2013 standards  of conduct"") effective 1 January 2013.          Status of the ""Standards of conduct for the international  civil service""       6.  The 2013 standards of conduct are aimed at assisting staff members and  executive heads of the organizations in understanding better the obligations placed    ST/SGB/2016/9        7/48  16-12690    on staff conduct by the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules. They provide a  discussion of expected standards to help staff understand their role as international  civil servants, complementing the Staff Regulations and Rules. References to  relevant paragraphs in the standards of conduct are made in the commentary.        II. Charter of the United Nations and the Convention on the  Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations         Provisions relating to the status, basic rights and duties of  United Nations staff members, with commentary        A. Charter of the United Nations          Chapter III      Organs        Article 7    1.  There are established as the principal organs of the United Nations: a General  Assembly, a Security Council, an Economic and Social Council, a Trusteeship  Council, an International Court of Justice, and a Secretariat.  2.  Such subsidiary organs as may be found necessary may be established in  accordance with the present Charter.        Article 8      The United Nations shall place no restrictions on the eligibility of men and  women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its  principal and subsidiary organs.        Chapter XV      The Secretariat        Article 97      The Secretariat shall comprise a Secretary-General and such staff as the  Organization may require. The Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General  Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. He shall be the chief  administrative officer of the Organization.        Article 98      The Secretary-General shall act in that capacity in all meetings of the General  Assembly, of the Security Council, of the Economic and Social Council, and of the  Trusteeship Council, and shall perform such other functions as are entrusted to him  by these organs. The Secretary-General shall make an annual report to the General  Assembly on the work of the Organization.    ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  8/48        Article 100    1.  In the performance of their duties the Secretary-General and the staff shall not  seek or receive instructions from any Government or from any other authority  external to the Organization. They shall refrain from any action which might reflect  on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organization.  2.  Each Member of the United Nations undertakes to respect the exclusively  international character of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the staff  and not to seek to influence them in the discharge of their responsibilities.        Article 101    1.  The staff shall be appointed by the Secretary-General under regulations  established by the General Assembly.  2.  Appropriate staffs shall be permanently assigned to the Economic and Social  Council, the Trusteeship Council, and, as required, to other organs of the United  Nations. These staffs shall form a part of the Secretariat.  3.  The paramount consideration in the employment of the staff and the  determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing the  highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. Due regard shall be paid  to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.        Chapter XVI      Miscellaneous provisions        Article 105    1.  The Organization shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such  privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfilment of its purposes.  2.  Representatives of the Members of the United Nations and officials of the  Organization shall similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary  for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organization.  3.  The General Assembly may make recommendations with a view to  determining the details of the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article or  may propose conventions to the Members of the United Nations for this purpose.        B. Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the  United Nations, adopted by the General Assembly by its  resolution 22 (I) of 13 February 1946          Article V    Section 20. Privileges and immunities are granted to officials in the interests of the  United Nations and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves ...  Section 21. The United Nations shall cooperate at all times with the appropriate  authorities of Members to facilitate the proper administration of justice, secure the  observance of police regulations, and prevent the occurrence of any abuse in  connection with the privileges, immunities and facilities ...      ST/SGB/2016/9        9/48  16-12690        Commentary        Staff members    1.  The Charter requires that staff members be ""appointed"" by the Secretary- General (or by those to whom this power has been delegated, either by the  Secretary-General alone or by the Secretary-General at the direction of the General  Assembly). The hallmark of a staff relationship is a letter of ""appointment"" issued  pursuant to staff regulation 4.1. The Staff Regulations apply to all staff members  within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter, whose employment relationship and  contractual link with the Organization are through a letter of appointment issued  pursuant to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly.  2.  To ensure that the revised Regulations apply to all staff members of the  Organization, including all staff members of all its principal and subsidiary organs,  even those with entirely separate administrations, the following sentence has been  inserted between the second and third sentence of the ""Scope and purpose""  provision of the Staff Regulations:    ""For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions 'United Nations  Secretariat', 'staff members' or 'staff' shall refer to all the staff members of  the Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United  Nations, whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a  letter of appointment subject to regulations promulgated by the General  Assembly pursuant to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter.""  The entire text of this provision is set out in section III of the present annex.  3.  Article 105 of the Charter empowers the General Assembly to make provisions  for the privileges and immunities of the ""officials"" of the Organization. The  Assembly did so by adopting the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the  United Nations on 13 February 1946 (hereinafter the ""General Convention"").  Article V of the General Convention provides for privileges and immunities for  officials and article VII provides for the issue of United Nations laissez-passers to  officials. By its resolution 76 (I) of 7 December 1946, the Assembly approved that  the provisions in articles V and VII of the General Convention apply to all staff  members of the United Nations with the exception of those ""recruited locally and  assigned to hourly rates"". Thus, all staff members governed by the Staff Regulations  are officials of the Organization.        III. Scope and purpose of the Staff Regulations of the  United Nations          Article I of the Staff Regulations of the United Nations and related  rules from chapter I of the Staff Rules, with commentary          Staff Regulations of the United Nations      Scope and purpose      The Staff Regulations embody the fundamental conditions of service and the  basic rights, duties and obligations of the United Nations Secretariat. They represent  the broad principles of human resources policy for the staffing and administration of  the Secretariat. For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions ""United  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  10/48    Nations Secretariat"", ""staff members"" or ""staff"" shall refer to all the staff members  of the Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United  Nations, whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a letter of  appointment subject to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly pursuant  to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter. The Secretary-General, as the chief  administrative officer, shall provide and enforce such staff rules consistent with  these principles as he or she considers necessary.        Article I      Duties, obligations and privileges        Staff regulation 1.1      Status of staff        Regulation 1.1 (a)      Staff members are international civil servants. Their responsibilities as staff  members are not national but exclusively international.        Commentary      Staff regulation 1.1 (a) clarifies that the responsibilities of staff are exclusively  international owing to their status as international civil servants (see paras. 3-15,  33 and 34 of the 2013 standards of conduct, reproduced in the present annex). This  requisite international outlook stems from an understanding of and loyalty to the  objectives and purposes of the United Nations itself. The term ""international civil  servants"" and the inherent rights and obligations that attach to this status apply to  all staff, whether locally or internationally recruited.         Regulation 1.1 (b)      Staff members shall make the following written declaration witnessed by the  Secretary-General or his or her authorized representative:      ""I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and  conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the  United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the  interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept  instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government  or other source external to the Organization.      ""I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations  incumbent upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules.""        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.1 (b) contains the declaration of office of staff, and its  opening words incorporate the text of former staff regulation 1.9 insofar as it relates  to staff members (see paras. 3-15 of the 2013 standards of conduct). It requests staff  members upon entry on duty to expressly declare that they will act with the interests  of the Organization only in view in the discharge of their functions.  2.  The second paragraph of the declaration refers specifically to the Staff  Regulations and Rules.    ST/SGB/2016/9        11/48  16-12690        Regulation 1.1 (c)      The Secretary-General shall ensure that the rights and duties of staff members,  as set out in the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules and in the relevant  resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, are respected.        Commentary      The regulation codifies a duty that falls on the Secretary-General, that is, to  ensure that the rights and duties of staff members are respected.        Regulation 1.1 (d)      The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that the paramount consideration in  the determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing staff  of the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.1 (d) places on the Secretary-General an affirmative duty to  seek to ensure that the criteria set out in Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter  for the determination of the conditions of service of the staff are implemented. This  provision is not intended to affect the role of legislative bodies involved in the  process of establishing conditions of service. It does, however, seek to formulate the  responsibility of the Secretary-General to advocate, in the appropriate forums, the  adoption of what he or she considers to be the appropriate conditions of service to  secure the recruitment and retention of staff possessing the highest standards of  efficiency, competence and integrity.  2.  The salaries of staff in the Professional and higher categories are determined  by reference to the best paying national civil service under what is known as the  Noblemaire principle. The salaries of staff in the General Service and related  categories are established by the Secretary-General on the basis of the best  prevailing conditions of employment in the locality where the United Nations office  concerned is located under what is commonly referred to as the Flemming principle.  The determination of the conditions of service of staff in the Field Service category  follows the same pattern as the Professional category.        Regulation 1.1 (e)      The Staff Regulations apply to all staff at all levels, including staff of the  separately funded organs, holding appointments under the Staff Rules.        Commentary      Regulation 1.1 (e) makes clear that the Staff Regulations apply to all staff  members, irrespective of levels, including staff members of the separately funded  organs within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter whose contractual link with  the Organization is through a letter of appointment issued pursuant to regulations  promulgated by the General Assembly.    ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  12/48        Regulation 1.1 (f)      The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations by virtue of  Article 105 of the Charter are conferred in the interests of the Organization. These  privileges and immunities furnish no excuse to the staff members who are covered  by them to fail to observe laws and police regulations of the State in which they are  located nor do they furnish an excuse for non-performance of their private  obligations. In any case where an issue arises regarding the application of these  privileges and immunities, the staff member shall immediately report the matter to  the Secretary-General, who alone may decide whether such privileges and  immunities exist and whether they shall be waived in accordance with the relevant  instruments.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.1 (f) defines the scope and extent of the privileges and  immunities of the United Nations that are enjoyed by staff in the interest of the  Organization (see also paras. 43 and 44 of the 2013 standards of conduct).  2.  Staff rule 1.2 (b) (see below) deals with the obligation of staff to honour their  private legal obligations.        Staff rule 1.1       Status of staff        Rule 1.1 (a)      The declaration made by a staff member on appointment pursuant to staff  regulation 1.1 (b) shall be placed in his or her official status file. A new declaration  shall be made after a break in service that exceeds three months.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.1 (a) codifies that the written declaration made on appointment is  placed in the official status file. The second sentence seeks to ensure that a new  declaration is made after a break in service that exceeds three months unless the  staff member is reinstated and the staff member's services are considered continuous  under current staff rule 4.18 (b).        Rule 1.1 (b)      The declaration administered under staff regulation 1.1 (b) shall not prevent  the close collaboration of staff with a Government pursuant to an agreement  between the Government and the United Nations.         Commentary      Staff rule 1.1 (b) clarifies that the written declaration does not prevent staff  members from liaising and working with a Government where there has been an  agreement, such as a technical cooperation agreement, between the Government  and the United Nations. Staff members remain bound by their declaration towards  the Organization and the principles guiding the international civil service.       ST/SGB/2016/9        13/48  16-12690        Staff regulation 1.2      Basic rights and obligations of staff        Core values        Regulation 1.2 (a)      Staff members shall uphold and respect the principles set out in the Charter,  including faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human  person and in the equal rights of men and women. Consequently, staff members  shall exhibit respect for all cultures; they shall not discriminate against any  individual or group of individuals or otherwise abuse the power and authority vested  in them.        Commentary      This provision describes the basic values and behaviours expected of  international civil servants because of their status. At the heart of those values are  the principles set out in the preamble to the Charter. The first sentence is a  quotation from those opening words, and the second sentence sets out the obligation  of staff flowing from a commitment to those values (see also paras. 2-6, 14, 15, 21  and 22 of the 2013 standards of conduct).        Regulation 1.2 (b)      Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence  and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, but is not limited to, probity,  impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and  status.        Commentary    1.  This provision describes more basic values expected of international civil  servants because of their status. It is derived from Article 101, paragraph 3, of the  Charter and affirmatively places on staff the obligation to uphold the highest  standards of efficiency, competence and integrity after appointment to the  Secretariat.  2.  At the heart of those values is integrity, allied with a dedication to the values  and principles set out in the Charter. As discussed in paragraph 5 of the  2013 standards of conduct, the concept of integrity ""embraces all aspects of  behaviour of an international civil servant, including such qualities as honesty,  truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility"".  3.  Various other provisions deal with particular manifestations of this set of basic  values in different circumstances, for example, staff regulations 1.2 (d)-(i), (m)  and (n).        General rights and obligations        Regulation 1.2 (c)      Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to  assignment by him or her to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations. In  exercising this authority the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure, having regard to  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  14/48    the circumstances, that all necessary safety and security arrangements are made for  staff carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to them.        Commentary    1.  The Secretary-General, as the chief administrative officer of the Organization,  has an inherent responsibility to seek to ensure the safety of staff. This regulation  recognizes that responsibility as a basic right of staff (see also para. 41 of the 2013  standards of conduct).  2.  In exercising his or her authority to assign staff to any of the activities of the  Organization, the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that, while assigned to  hardship areas, staff are afforded reasonable conditions of life and work having  regard to the existing conditions.  3.  Furthermore, since staff are subject to assignment, measures should be taken  to ensure that staff are advised of conditions prevailing at the duty station to which  they are assigned.        Regulation 1.2 (d)      In the performance of their duties staff members shall neither seek nor accept  instructions from any Government or from any other source external to the  Organization.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (d) flows from the first sentence of Article 100,  paragraph 1, of the Charter (see paras. 8, 12, 33 and 34 of the 2013 standards of  conduct).  2.  This regulation makes clear that directions or instructions to staff come from  the Secretary-General, who must fulfil only the legislative mandates of the  Organization. This is true in all areas, including, for example, decisions relating to  the appointment and promotion of staff, which are for the Secretary-General to  make as the chief administrative officer of the Organization. In this context, it is  improper for staff to request or allow a Government to intervene in a selection or  appointment decision.         Regulation 1.2 (e)      By accepting appointment, staff members pledge themselves to discharge their  functions and regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organization only in  view. Loyalty to the aims, principles and purposes of the United Nations, as set forth  in its Charter, is a fundamental obligation of all staff members by virtue of their  status as international civil servants.        Commentary    1.  The first sentence of staff regulation 1.2 (e) reiterates the oath or declaration  of office and sets out the principle that staff must regulate their conduct with only  the interests of the Organization in view (see paras. 4 and 7 of the 2013 standards of  conduct). The second sentence of staff regulation 1.2 (e) focuses on the concept of  loyalty to the aims, principles and purposes of the Organization as set out in the    ST/SGB/2016/9        15/48  16-12690    Charter (which is alluded to in the declaration contained in staff regulation 1.1 (b))  (ibid., paras. 4, 7 and 34). It highlights those obligations which arise from the very  status of a staff member and which, at present, are set out only in the declaration  subscribed to by staff upon their entry on duty.  2.  The Secretary-General, and those to whom he or she has delegated decision- making authority, has the responsibility to make decisions as to whether the staff  have complied with the provisions of the Staff Regulations and Rules. Since no set of  rules, no matter how long or complex, can cover all situations, it is clear that there  must be discretion in the application of the rules. This is common to all systems of  administrative law. However, the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General is  not unlimited, and relevant jurisprudence has consistently held that decisions  cannot be tainted by prejudice, arbitrariness, improper motive or discrimination.         Regulation 1.2 (f)      While staff members' personal views and convictions, including their political  and religious convictions, remain inviolable, staff members shall ensure that those  views and convictions do not adversely affect their official duties or the interests of  the United Nations. They shall conduct themselves at all times in a manner befitting  their status as international civil servants and shall not engage in any activity that is  incompatible with the proper discharge of their duties with the United Nations. They  shall avoid any action and, in particular, any kind of public pronouncement that may  adversely reflect on their status, or on the integrity, independence and impartiality  that are required by that status.        Commentary    1.  As stated in paragraph 2 of the 2013 standards of conduct:    ""... international civil servants have a special calling: to serve the ideals of  peace, respect for fundamental rights, economic and social progress, and  international cooperation. It is therefore incumbent on international civil  servants to adhere to the highest standards of conduct; for, ultimately, it is the  international civil service that will enable the United Nations system to bring  about a just and peaceful world.""  (See also para. 5 on the integrity expected of international civil servants; paras. 4, 7  and 37 on loyalty; paras. 6, 9 and 14 on tolerance and understanding; paras. 9  and 10 on impartiality; paras. 11 and 12 on independence; paras. 4, 14 and 40 on  international outlook; and para.15 on freedom from discrimination.)  2.  The 2013 standards of conduct state, in paragraph 9:      ""Impartiality implies tolerance and restraint, particularly in dealing with  political or religious convictions. While their personal views remain inviolate,  international civil servants do not have the freedom of private persons to take  sides or to express their convictions publicly on controversial matters, either  individually or as members of a group, irrespective of the medium used. This  can mean that, in certain situations, personal views should be expressed only  with tact and discretion.""  3.  As noted in the commentary on regulation 1.2 (e), it is for the Secretary- General to decide whether a staff member has met the standards set out in this  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  16/48    provision. While the Secretary-General has the responsibility and discretion to  assess a staff member's conduct, such discretion must be exercised reasonably,  without improper motives and in accordance with the requirements of due process.  The United Nations Dispute and Appeals Tribunals have reiterated this principle in  their jurisprudence.         Regulation 1.2 (g)      Staff members shall not use their office or knowledge gained from their  official functions for private gain, financial or otherwise, or for the private gain of  any third party, including family, friends and those they favour. Nor shall staff  members use their office for personal reasons to prejudice the positions of those  they do not favour.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (g) is consistent with principles set out in the  2013 standards of conduct (paras. 23-26 29, 38 and 39). The use of one's office for  personal gain is unacceptable. This includes conducting business from a United  Nations office or using the Organization's property, such as information technology  resources. As such, it includes using the United Nations facilities for a business,  using the United Nations name, logo or address for a business or approving a  contract for a family business, as well as conducting business for private gain  through a personal e-mail using the Organization's information technology  infrastructure or equipment. It also reflects the principle that staff members shall  not use information that has not been made public for the private advantage of the  staff member or any third party.  2.  Staff regulation 1.2 (g), for the sake of clarity, makes specific reference to the  prohibition on a staff member favouring a third party, including family or friends,  from profiting from a staff member's position or the exercise of his or her functions.  The terms ""family"" and ""friends"" are broad and intended to encompass not only  family members and friends as normally understood, but also relationships that are  not recognized by the Staff Regulations and Rules as creating a dependency.   3.  The regulation also prohibits the use of office or knowledge gained from that  office for personal reasons to prejudice or harm the careers of individual staff  members or harm third parties.   4.   This regulation also applies to and prohibits using one's office or the  Organization's property or resources, including information technology, to advertise  or otherwise advance private or political interests of others, including, but not  limited to, private companies or political parties. This includes the use of private  e-mail in the office or through the Organization's infrastructure or equipment for  such purposes.         Regulation 1.2 (h)      Staff members may exercise the right to vote but shall ensure that their  participation in any political activity is consistent with, and does not reflect  adversely upon, the independence and impartiality required by their status as  international civil servants.      ST/SGB/2016/9        17/48  16-12690        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (h) reiterates the principle addressed in the 2013  standards of conduct (paras. 9, 10, 33, 48 and 49) emphasizing the need to ensure  that political activities do not have an impact on the independence and impartiality  of staff. This provision clarifies that staff members may have political views in  general, but need to ensure that political views and activities do not have an impact  on their independence and impartiality.   2.  The notion of consistency with the status of an international civil servant is to  be determined by the Secretary-General in view of the necessity of staff being, and  appearing to be, independent and impartial. Thus, it is clear that staff members  cannot be candidates for political office. In case of doubt, inquiries could be made  by staff pursuant to staff rule 1.2 (t) and relevant administrative issuances  governing outside activities, as well as to the Ethics Office.  3.  Staff members have the right to form staff representative bodies in accordance  with staff regulations 8.1 and 8.2 in order to ensure, in the words of staff regulation  8.1, ""the effective participation of staff in identifying, examining and resolving  issues relating to staff welfare, including conditions of work, general conditions of  life and other human resources policies"".  4.   Staff regulation 1.2 (h) also addresses participation in political events in  public such as a political rally. While staff may have political views, their status as  impartial international civil servants never ceases while in service, and expression  of a particular political opinion or opinion about a particularly sensitive political  matter in public may not be compatible with that status.         Regulation 1.2 (i)      Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all matters of  official business. They shall not communicate to any Government, entity, person or  any other source any information known to them by reason of their official position  that they know or ought to have known has not been made public, except as  appropriate in the normal course of their duties or by authorization of the Secretary- General. These obligations do not cease upon separation from service.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (i) reflects the fact that official information cannot be used  for private purposes, except with authorization. This flows from the idea that staff  members should place the interests of the Organization above their own (see para. 4  of the 2013 standards of conduct and the wording of the declaration under staff  regulation 1.1) and is intended to protect sensitive and confidential information  where the disclosure would have an adverse impact on the Organization's interests,  operations and activities. It follows that permission must be obtained for disclosure  to third parties of information that has not been made public, unless such disclosure  is in the normal course of the duties of the staff member (for example, a press  officer) or a staff member was specifically authorized to make such disclosure in the  circumstances in question (see also staff regulation 1.2 (r) regarding the duty of  staff to cooperate with United Nations investigations).  2.  The last sentence of the regulation provides that the obligations set out in the  provision do not cease upon separation from service. If a former staff member were  to ignore the regulation, a note could be placed in his or her official status file to  prevent re-employment.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  18/48        Honours, gifts or remuneration      Regulation 1.2 (j)      No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any Government.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulations 1.2 (j), (k) and (l) provide the basic provisions regulating the  issue of acceptance by staff members of any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from outside sources (see paras. 50 and 51 of the 2013 standards of  conduct).a The purpose of these regulations is to ensure the independence and  impartiality of staff members.   2.  Staff regulation 1.2 (j) contains the basic rule that staff may not accept any  honour, decoration, gift or remuneration from any Government (ibid., para. 47), b  whereby the term ""Government"" is to be understood broadly, including national,  state and municipal authorities and any government representative or other agent  as well as intergovernmental organizations.   3.   This rule applies whatever the reason for the award, even if the award is  unrelated to the staff member's service with the Organization, since it is imperative  that an international civil servant be perceived as independent from any national  Government or other international organization. This includes governmental  housing supplements or other support payments or perquisites, which in all cases  can be deemed as a possible conflict of interest and infringement into the staff  member's impartial status. It does not apply, however, to subsidies or perquisites  offered locally to all United Nations staff members at a duty station such as state- subsidized childcare facilities or other aspects addressed in the host country  agreement context such as tax or duty exemptions.   4.  Staff regulation 1.2 (j) stresses the importance of the appearance of strict  independence and impartiality of staff and thus reaffirms the absolute prohibition  on acceptance of benefits from Governments. No exception to this prohibition  beyond staff regulation 1.2 (k) (see below) is foreseen, and there is no basis for the  Secretary-General to grant approval for acceptance.   5.   This provision does not include receipt of remuneration in the form of salary  from another international organization where staff are serving under an approved  contractual modality such as secondment or loan on the basis of the Inter- Organization Agreement concerning Transfer, Secondment or Loan of Staff among  the Organizations Applying the United Nations Common System of Salaries and  Allowances or bilateral agreements.       __________________    a  Even though para. 50 envisages the possibility of authorization by the executive head of an  organization of an honour, decoration, gift, favour or remuneration from a Government, this is  precluded by staff regulation 1.2 (j), as explained in paras. 2 and 3 of the commentary on  regulation 1.2 (j).    b  Staff regulation 3.4 (c) envisages that staff members may accept child benefits from their  Governments but that, in such a case, United Nations dependency benefits will be reduced. The  United Nations may also consider accepting housing provided from Governments, and when staff  are assigned to such housing, rental deductions from emoluments are applicable.    ST/SGB/2016/9        19/48  16-12690        Regulation 1.2 (k)      If refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour or gift from a  Government would cause embarrassment to the Organization, the staff member may  receive it on behalf of the Organization and then report and entrust it to the  Secretary-General, who will either retain it for the Organization or arrange for its  disposal for the benefit of the Organization or for a charitable purpose.c         Commentary      It can happen that a staff member is given an unanticipated honour,  decoration, favour or gift, perhaps in public, by a minister or even a head of State.  In such cases, a public refusal could cause a needlessly unpleasant incident. In such  cases, regulation 1.2 (k) clarifies that the unanticipated honour, decoration, favour  or gift may be received by the staff member, but only and expressly on behalf of the  United Nations. The honour, decoration, favour or gift must then be given to the  Secretary-General for retention or disposal by the Organization. d Remuneration  from a Government must always be refused, and such refusal, as staff are paid by  the Organization, could hardly cause embarrassment.        Regulation 1.2 (l)      No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any non-governmental source without first obtaining the  approval of the Secretary-General.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (l) requires that a staff member not accept any honour,  decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from a non-governmental source without  first obtaining the approval of the Secretary-General (see also paras. 50 and 51 of  the 2013 standards of conduct).   2.  A non-governmental source means any non-governmental organization or any  private source. Educational institutions, even though at times publicly or  government-funded, are considered to be a non-governmental source.e   3.   Approval is not granted where the honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration is incompatible with the status of an international civil servant; or  may be granted with conditions such as the obligation to entrust it to the  Organization upon receipt, in particular when the honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration is related to the official function of the staff member.   4.   Staff rule 1.2 (l) allows for acceptance of an unanticipated honour, decoration,  favour or gift under similar circumstances of acceptance of gifts from Governments.       __________________    c  See ST/AI/2010/1 on reporting, retaining and disposing of honours, decorations, favours, gifts or  remuneration from governmental and non-governmental sources.    d  Ibid.    e  Ibid.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  20/48        Conflict of interest        Regulation 1.2 (m)      A conflict of interest occurs when, by act or omission, a staff member's  personal interests interfere with the performance of his or her official duties and  responsibilities or with the integrity, independence and impartiality required by the  staff member's status as an international civil servant. When an actual or possible  conflict of interest does arise, the conflict shall be disclosed by staff members to  their head of office, mitigated by the Organization and resolved in favour of the  interests of the Organization.        Commentary    1.  The purpose of staff regulation 1.2 (m) is to inform staff that they cannot allow  personal interests to interfere with the performance of their duties or their status as  international civil servants. The regulation clarifies that actual as well as potential  conflicts must be avoided, disclosed and resolved. The key interest is the interest of  the Organization. It will be for the Secretary-General and heads of departments to  assess whether a particular act or omission raises a potential conflict of interest  situation. Staff are obliged to disclose even possible conflicts and to follow  instructions on how to resolve the situation, including to avoid and remove the  conflict or the circumstances that make it a possible conflict. Failure by a staff  member to disclose an actual or possible conflict can seriously disrupt operations of  the Organization and pose detriment to the Organization's integrity and reputation  as a whole, and may lead to the imposition of disciplinary measures against the staff  member.   2.   The definition of ""conflict of interest"" is complemented by the similar but  more comprehensive definition set out in paragraph 23 of the 2013 standards of  conduct, as follows:     ""Conflicts of interest may occur when an international civil servant's personal  interests interfere with the performance of his/her official duties or call into  question the qualities of integrity, independence and impartiality required by  the status of an international civil servant. Conflicts of interest include  circumstances in which international civil servants, directly or indirectly, may  benefit improperly, or allow a third party to benefit improperly, from their  association with their organization. Conflicts of interest can arise from an  international civil servant's personal or familial dealings with third parties,  individuals, beneficiaries, or other institutions. If a conflict of interest or  possible conflict of interest does arise, the conflict shall be disclosed,  addressed and resolved in the best interest of the organization. Questions  entailing a conflict of interest can be very sensitive and need to be treated with  care.""   3.  This provision does not seek to affect the efforts of staff associations  established under staff regulation 8.1 to raise funds from staff for their activities.        Regulation 1.2 (n)      All staff members at the D-1 level and above shall be required to file financial  disclosure statements on appointment and at intervals therefore as prescribed by the  Secretary-General, in respect of themselves, their spouses and their dependent    ST/SGB/2016/9        21/48  16-12690    children, and to assist the Secretary-General in verifying the accuracy of the  information submitted when so requested. The financial disclosure statements shall  include certification that the assets and economic activities of the staff members,  their spouses and their dependent children do not pose a conflict of interest with  their official duties or the interests of the United Nations. The financial disclosure  statements will remain confidential and will only be used, as prescribed by the  Secretary-General, in making determinations pursuant to staff regulation 1.2 (m).  The Secretary-General may require other staff to file financial disclosure statements  as he or she deems necessary in the interest of the Organization.         Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (n) includes all staff at the D-1 level and above in the  obligation to submit financial disclosure statements on appointment and at intervals  as prescribed by the Secretary-General (see also para. 24 of the 2013 standards of  conduct), in respect of themselves, their spouses and dependent children. This  requirement is designed to minimize the risk of officials being perceived as using  their position for personal gain and to detect, manage or mitigate reputational and  conflict of interest risks to the Organization. The regulation makes it clear that these  financial disclosure statements will remain confidential and will only be used by the  Secretary-General in assessing whether an actual or possible conflict of interest as  per staff regulation 1.2 (m) exists. Staff are in all cases obliged to also inform their  head of office or department in case of any actual or possible conflict of interest  under staff regulation 1.2 (m), regardless of whether or not they are required to file  a financial disclosure statement.   2.  Staff regulation 1.2 (n) places the burden of the initial assessment on the staff  members themselves: staff members have to certify that no conflict of interest exists.  Staff members must fully cooperate with the Secretary-General's efforts to verify  any submitted information. Where in doubt, staff members should contact the Ethics  Office to seek advice about risks for conflicts of interest and how to manage them.  Where there is even a possibility of an actual or potential conflict of interest, staff  are obliged to inform their head of office or department; this is independent and  separate from the disclosure mechanism under staff regulation 1.2 (n).f Further,  filing a financial disclosure statement does not substitute for the obligation to  inform the head of office or department of any actual or potential conflict of  interest.  3.   Staff regulation 1.2 (n) also gives to the Secretary-General the authority to  prescribe the form and periodic interval of such disclosure statements, to establish  procedures to ensure that the statements remain confidential, and to require other  staff to file financial disclosure statements.   4.   The Secretariat's mechanism for financial disclosure statements under staff  regulation 1.2 (n) is detailed in Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2006/6,  entitled ""Financial disclosure and declaration of interest statements"".g     __________________    f  The Secretary-General, by his bulletin ST/SGB/2005/22, entitled ""Ethics Office -- establishment  and terms of reference"", entrusted the Ethics Office with the task of administering the financial  disclosure programme.    g  Throughout the bulletin, any references to administrative issuances include any amendment or  superseding issuance on the subject.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  22/48        Outside employment and activities        Regulation 1.2 (o)      Staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation or employment,  whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary-General.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (o) reflects the Organization's long-standing policy on  outside occupation or employment, whether during or outside the work week (see  also paras. 45-49 of the 2013 standards of conduct).   2.  The notion of occupation includes, but is not limited to, the practice of a  profession or calling (whether as an employee or on an independent contract) or  any concern in the nature of trade. Employment is generally understood as a legal  relationship pursuant to which one person is providing work and skill at the control  and direction of another. At the same time, self-employment, ownership of an entity,  undertaking management responsibilities for an entity, or serving in any  management capacity, e.g., on any non-United Nations entity or freelance work are  also covered by the notion of ""occupation"" and ""employment"" and require the  approval of the Secretary-General. Renting out immovable or movable properties  may constitute an occupation, depending on factors such as the number of  properties and the income derived from such activity.   3.   Being on a leave arrangement from an employer other than the United Nations  is also considered ""employment"" or ""occupation"" within the meaning of this  provision, even if no directions are given. Such a leave arrangement would  constitute a conflict of interest and contradict the status of international civil  servants; therefore, it must be disclosed and resolved in the interest of the  Organization. Leave arrangements from government service while working for the  United Nations are addressed in tripartite agreements among the United Nations,  the Government and the staff member. Secondment from government service is  addressed in staff regulation 4.1 and annex II, paragraph (c), of the Staff  Regulations, which provide for the need for supporting documentation on the terms  and conditions of such secondment agreed to by the Member State and the staff  member. Without such agreement, the staff member may be required to cancel the  leave arrangement in the light of his or her status as an international civil servant.   4.   The 2013 standards of conduct clarify that staff members on leave, with or  without pay, from the United Nations should bear in mind that they remain  international civil servants and remain subject to the Organization's regulations and  rules. Therefore, staff may engage in an outside occupation or employment or  outside activity only with express permission from the Organization, including when  on leave (para. 47).   5.   No approval is possible for outside occupation or employment in governmental  service in a political office, in a diplomatic or other representational post or in any  other function not compatible with the staff member's continued status as an  international civil servant. This cannot be authorized in the context of special leave  arrangements under staff rule 5.3 (b). In exceptional circumstances, however, purely  technical functions could be approved at the request of a Government.       ST/SGB/2016/9        23/48  16-12690        Regulation 1.2 (p)      The Secretary-General may authorize staff members to engage in an outside  occupation or employment, whether remunerated or not, if:    (i)  The outside occupation or employment does not conflict with the staff  member's official functions or the status of an international civil servant;    (ii) The outside occupation or employment is not against the interest of the  United Nations; and    (iii) The outside occupation or employment is permitted by local law at the  duty station or where the occupation or employment occurs.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (p) sets out in specific terms the Organization's long- standing requirements that must be met before a staff member may be given  permission to engage in an outside occupation or employment. The key factors in  determining whether permission should be granted relate to the compatibility of that  occupation or employment with the status of and the functions being discharged by  the staff member and with the interests of the United Nations (see also paras. 45-49  of the 2013 standards of conduct). In addition, the occupation or employment must  be permitted by local law. If the Secretary-General decides under his discretionary  authority that permission for such occupation or employment should be denied, a  reason will be given.   2.  The first requirement is that there be no conflict with the staff member's  official functions or with the staff member's status as an international civil servant.  For example, it would not be appropriate for a member of the Office of Legal  Affairs to be working part-time in an outside law firm. Another example would be  outside employment with an organization, including a non-governmental one, that  might wish to enter into contractual or other relations with the United Nations. A  conflict between official functions and outside employment can also exist simply in  the need for the staff member to dedicate time to the outside employment, as staff  members are expected -- and remunerated -- to devote their entire work time to the  interest and work of the United Nations and to be available when exigencies of  service so require.   3.  The second requirement is that such occupation or employment not be against  the interest of the United Nations, primarily, that the occupation or employment  does not reflect adversely upon the United Nations. For example, permission would  not be granted for a staff member to work with an organization the goals of which  are incompatible with those of the United Nations or to work in a capacity that  could call into question the impartiality and independence of the staff member. This  is often the case where staff are asked by Governments or public officials to work  for them or organizations or companies related to them while remaining staff  members of the United Nations. Other examples include working for entities the  objectives or work methods or practices of which contradict or are not compatible  with the goals, objectives or values of the Organization. In addition,  non-governmental organizations often follow political interests or seek contractual  links to the Organization that may have to be reviewed when assessing a request by  a staff member. The key element is safeguarding the impartiality of the international  civil servant (see paras. 3-14 of the 2013 standards of conduct).   ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  24/48    4.  The third requirement is that the occupation or employment be permitted  under the law of the duty station concerned. For example, in the United States of  America, staff holding G-4 visas are not permitted under local law to accept outside  employment or to earn money from an occupation, so no permission would be  granted.   5.  Outside activities that relate to the United Nations are regulated through staff  rule 1.2 (t). Outside non-remunerated activities that have nothing to do with a staff  member's official functions would remain at the discretion of the staff member (for  example, the secretary of a stamp club) and normally do not require the approval of  the Secretary-General, unless they have an impact on the staff member's  performance of official duties (see para. 45 of the 2013 standards of conduct).        Use of property and assets        Regulation 1.2 (q)      Staff members shall use the property and assets of the Organization only for  official purposes and shall exercise reasonable care when utilizing such property  and assets.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (q) makes explicit the duty to use reasonable care when  utilizing the property and assets of the Organization; this duty is behind several  provisions in the Financial Rules and the Staff Rules. It includes all property and  assets, including information and communications technology (ICT) that is provided  for official purposes only. As per ST/SGB/2004/15 on use of information and  communication technology resources and data, this also encompasses the ICT  resources and data itself.   2.  Management accountability for the way in which staff resources are utilized is  discussed in the commentary on staff rule 1.3 (a).        Regulation 1.2 (r)      Staff members must respond fully to requests for information from staff  members and other officials of the Organization authorized to investigate the  possible misuse of funds, waste or abuse.        Commentary    1.  Staff regulation 1.2 (r) builds on the obligation to supply information set out in  current staff rule 1.5. This provision seeks to ensure that staff members clearly  understand that they must cooperate with official investigations by the Organization  and must supply information on their official actions to, for example, the internal or  external auditors or internal investigators or ad hoc inquiry panels. Such requests  are not in the nature of criminal inquiries where an individual may refuse to answer  on the basis of self-incrimination. The issue in the employment relationship between  a staff member and the Organization is whether the highest standards of  competence, efficiency and integrity required of United Nations staff members have  been met.    ST/SGB/2016/9        25/48  16-12690    2.  The Secretary-General has the authority to request staff to supply information,  and the staff have a duty to do so. This is without prejudice to the rights of staff  under article X of the Staff Regulations and chapter X of the Staff Rules.         Staff rule 1.2      Basic rights and obligations of staff        General        Rule 1.2 (a)      Staff members shall follow the directions and instructions properly issued by  the Secretary-General and by their supervisors.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (a) deals with the obligation of staff to follow directions properly  given by supervising officials (see paras. 16-20 of the 2013 standards of conduct).   2.  As per the 2013 standards of conduct, staff members must follow the  instructions they receive in connection with their official functions, but also have a  right to ask for written instructions if they have doubts as to the consistency of the  instruction with the Charter or any other constitutional instrument, decisions of the  governing bodies or administrative rules and regulations (para. 19). Although it is  clear that staff must follow instructions, it should also be noted that they have a  right to challenge instructions that they consider to violate their contract of  employment or terms of appointment pursuant to chapter XI of the Staff Rules.  3.  Staff do not have to follow instructions that are manifestly inconsistent with  their official functions or threaten their safety or have nothing to do with their  official activities, since such instructions are not proper. The use of the word  ""properly"" in staff rule 1.2 (a) means that a supervisor who gives improper  instructions will be held accountable. Such cases are rare and can usually be  handled by seeking a review from the supervisor at the next level or by consulting  the Office of Human Resources Management.        Rule 1.2 (b)      Staff members must comply with local laws and honour their private legal  obligations, including, but not limited to, the obligation to honour orders of  competent courts.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (b) is an amplification of staff regulation 1.1 (f), which provides  that the privileges and immunities of the Organization afford no excuse to staff for  non-performance of their private obligations (see paras. 43 and 44 of the 2013  standards of conduct). The Secretary-General shall determine in any particular case  whether such privileges and immunities exist and, if so, whether they shall be  waived.   2.  Staff rule 1.2 (b) makes clear to staff that they have an obligation to honour  such private legal obligations. This provision assists the Organization effectively in  ensuring that staff respect the applicable laws and court orders relating to their  private obligations, including, but not limited to, obligations under civil  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  26/48    (contract/tort, etc.), family or immigration laws. In the event that a plaintiff  forwards to the Organization a court order against a staff member, the  Administration will seek the views of the staff member before taking any action on  the basis of that order. It is the responsibility of staff who have an order against  them that they contest to avail themselves of all existing means under the applicable  national law to appeal the order and/or obtain relief from the obligation to comply  with the order pending its appeal.  3.  Failure to honour such private obligations may be treated as a disciplinary  matter under article X of the Staff Regulations and chapter X of the Staff Rules. In  cases of non-compliance with family support court orders, deductions from staff  members' salaries, wages and other emoluments may be made in accordance with  the procedures set out in Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/1999/4. Other  indebtedness to third parties may also result in deductions made from a staff  member's emoluments under staff rule 3.18 (c).   4.   Non-compliance with private legal obligations can also amount to a staff  member bringing the Organization into disrepute, and staff must act in accordance  with their status at all times.         Rule 1.2 (c)      Staff members have the duty to report any breach of the Organization's  regulations and rules to the officials whose responsibility it is to take appropriate  action and to cooperate with duly authorized audits and investigations. Staff  members shall not be retaliated against for complying with these duties.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (c) emphasizes the obligation of all staff members to report  breaches of the Organization's regulations and rules through the designated  reporting channels. At the same time, it manifests the principle of non-retaliation  against staff for having reported breaches of rules by others. Both the duty to report  and the protection from retaliation encourage efforts on the part of all to further the  United Nations as an Organization driven by integrity and transparency. It ensures  that breaches such as embezzlement are brought to the attention of the Organization  by staff who may know about such breaches and who do not have to fear retaliation  for their honesty.         Rule 1.2 (d)      Disciplinary procedures set out in article X of the Staff Regulations and  chapter X of the Staff Rules may be instituted against a staff member who fails to  comply with his or her obligations and the standards of conduct set out in the  Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Rules, the Financial  Regulations and Rules, and administrative issuances.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (d) ensures that staff are held accountable through disciplinary  procedures for failure to comply with their obligations and the standards of conduct  set out in the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Rules, the  Financial Regulations and Rules and all related issuances. Administrative issuances    ST/SGB/2016/9        27/48  16-12690    refer to issuances promulgated by the Secretary-General, or by those who hold  authority delegated by the Secretary-General, in furtherance of the Staff  Regulations and  Rules  and  the  Financial  Regulations  and  Rules  (see  ST/SGB/2009/4).        Specific instances of prohibited conduct        Rule 1.2 (e)      Sexual exploitation and abuse is prohibited. Sexual activity with children  (persons under the age of 18) is prohibited regardless of the age of majority or the  age of consent locally, except where a staff member is legally married to a person  who is under the age of 18 but over the age of majority or consent in his or her  country of citizenship. Mistaken belief in the age of a child is not a defence. The  exchange of money, employment, goods or services for sex, including sexual  favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour, is  prohibited. United Nations staff members are obliged to create and maintain an  environment that prevents sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.        Commentary      Staff rules 1.2 (e)-(k) address specific instances of prohibited conduct. Staff  rule 1.2 (e) was added to address the Organization's serious and growing concern  over sexual exploitation and abuse. Sexual exploitation and abuse is listed as a  matter of serious misconduct under staff regulation 10.1 (b). Staff rule 1.2 (e)  reflects the importance that the Organization attaches to preventing and addressing  cases of exploitation and abuse, in line with the Secretary-General's zero-tolerance  policy.         Rule 1.2 (f)      Any form of discrimination or harassment, including sexual or gender  harassment, as well as abuse in any form at the workplace or in connection with  work, is prohibited.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (f) reproduces the core of Secretary-General's bulletin  ST/SGB/2008/5, which sets out United Nations policy on equal treatment of men and  women in the Secretariat, and which also prohibits all forms of discrimination,  harassment, including sexual harassment, and abuse of authority (see also  paras. 15, 21 and 22 of the 2013 standards of conduct). The clarification ""in any  form"" emphasizes that acts of abuse and harassment may take many forms and are  not limited to physical or verbal abuse.   2.   All dealings among staff members should be governed by the principles of  dignity and mutual respect. Inappropriate behaviour that does not comport with  these standards should be addressed by managers and supervisors, irrespective of  whether the behaviour may rise to the level of abuse. This follows from their  obligation in positions of leadership to ensure a harmonious workplace based on  mutual respect (see paras. 16 and 21 of the 2013 standards of conduct).       ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  28/48        Rule 1.2 (g)      Staff members shall not disrupt or otherwise interfere with any meeting or  other official activity of the Organization, including activity in connection with the  administration of justice system, nor shall staff members threaten, intimidate or  otherwise engage in any conduct intended, directly or indirectly, to interfere with  the ability of other staff members to discharge their official functions. Staff  members shall not threaten, retaliate or attempt to retaliate against such individuals  or against staff members exercising their rights and duties under the present Rules.         Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (g) prohibits actions that threaten, intimidate or interfere with  official functions and activities, as well as any act that would constitute retaliation  or attempted retaliation.   2.  The rule is not intended to prevent permitted activities in the exercise of rights  such as the right of staff to peaceful assembly, the right of representatives of staff  bodies to address the Fifth Committee or other organs that have authorized such  procedures, or the right of staff to meet in authorized meeting rooms. What is  prohibited are actions by staff members that prevent Member States, departments,  offices, staff and other authorized persons from holding a meeting or carrying out  an official activity. Ultimately, the applicability of the rule will be determined on a  case-by-case basis, but the test is reasonably clear in that conduct which prevents  others from performing official functions is not permitted.  3.  It is noted that at times staff representatives have for certain periods  suspended participation in joint bodies. Withdrawal by staff representatives from  joint bodies does not constitute interference with official functions, as in such cases  the Administration may proceed without the consultation normally needed pursuant  to article VIII of the Staff Regulations and chapter VIII of the Staff Rules.  4.   The last sentence of staff rule 1.2 (g) emphasizes the importance of the  Organization's policy prohibiting acts or attempts of retaliation (see also staff  rule 1.2 (c)).         Rule 1.2 (h)      Staff members shall not intentionally misrepresent their functions, official title  or the nature of their duties to Member States or to any entities or persons external  to the United Nations.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (h) prohibits the intentional misrepresentation of official title or  duties to outside parties, for example, by placing misleading titles on business  cards, usually for private advantage. The use of the word ""intentional"" makes clear  that this prohibition does not extend to accidental or inadvertent actions.  2.   While the rule expressly prohibits misrepresentation towards third parties,  such intentional misrepresentation towards other staff members is also prohibited.  3.   Accordingly, staff members should use the functional or official title  associated with the position they hold within the Organization, and refrain from    ST/SGB/2016/9        29/48  16-12690    using academic, professional or honorific titles such as prefixes or suffixes in their  presentation towards others when acting on official business.         Rule 1.2 (i)      Staff members shall not intentionally alter, destroy, falsify or misplace or  render useless any official document, record or file entrusted to them by virtue of  their functions, which document, record or file is intended to be kept as part of the  records of the Organization.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (i) puts staff on notice that the intentional unauthorized  destruction, alteration, falsification or misplacement or other means of rendering  useless any records that were intended to form part of the official files of the  Organization, or a department or office, is prohibited. This has been a problem from  time to time in disciplinary cases or audits when key documents have been found to  be missing from official files of the Organization. The use of the word ""intentional""  makes clear that this is not a careless or accidental act. The word ""falsify"" has  been added to include cases where staff members may forge records or falsify  documents, for example, to claim benefits to which they were not entitled. Such  prohibited acts may also constitute fraud. Records or files include electronic records  or files and e-mail or other server-based records.         Rule 1.2 (j)      Staff members shall not seek to influence Member States, principal or  subsidiary organs of the United Nations or expert groups in order to obtain a change  from a position or decision taken by the Secretary-General, including decisions  relating to the financing of Secretariat programmes or units, or in order to secure  support for improving their personal situation or the personal situation of other staff  members or for blocking or reversing unfavourable decisions regarding their status  or their colleagues' status.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.2 (j) seeks to make clear that the lobbying of Member States by  individual staff members against positions taken by the Secretary-General is not  permitted (see also paras. 27-29 and 31 of the 2013 standards of conduct). This  includes lobbying Member States to intervene in the administration of justice on  behalf of a staff member.   2.  The General Assembly has recognized the importance of its informal  interaction with staff representatives in human resources management issues. Such  informal interactions with Member States by elected officials acting in staff  representative functions are not prohibited by staff rule 1.2 (j).         Rule 1.2 (k)      Staff members shall neither offer nor promise any favour, gift, remuneration or  any other personal benefit to another staff member or to any third party with a view  to causing him or her to perform, fail to perform or delay the performance of any  official act. Similarly, staff members shall neither seek nor accept any favour, gift,  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  30/48    remuneration or any other personal benefit from another staff member or from any  third party in exchange for performing, failing to perform or delaying the  performance of any official act.        Commentary      The prohibition in staff rule 1.2 (k) applies to a staff member's relations with  other staff members and with third parties. While the general proposition is that the  practices described in the rule violate the highest standards of integrity required of  staff members (see paras. 17, 50 and 51 of the 2013 standards of conduct), the  purpose of this rule is specifically to deal with the perversion and abuse of power,  influence-peddling and other improper or even corrupt practices. Offering or  accepting any favour, gift, remuneration or other incentive with the intention of  obtaining the performance, non-performance or delaying of official duties by the  staff member may, and in most cases does, constitute bribery and/or other forms of  misconduct.         Honours, gifts or remuneration        Rule 1.2 (l)      No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from any Government. However, if refusal of an unanticipated honour,  decoration, favour or gift from a Government would cause embarrassment to the  Organization, the staff member may receive it on behalf of the Organization  provided that it is reported and entrusted to the Secretary-General through  established procedures.         Commentary      Rule 1.2 (l) reiterates the prohibition on accepting any honour, decoration,  favour, gift or remuneration from any Government stipulated in staff regulation 1.2 (j)  and (k). The only possible exception is a situation in which a staff member is  presented with an unanticipated honour, decoration, etc., by a government official  and refusal to accept it would cause unnecessary embarrassment to the  Organization. In such a situation, the presented gift or award, etc., may be accepted  formally on behalf of the Organization, rather than on behalf of the individual staff  member. Staff members must report such receipt of gifts or honours, etc., and  entrust them to the Secretary-General through the established procedures.h See also  staff regulation 1.2 (j) above and the commentary on staff rule 1.2 (m) below.         Rule 1.2 (m)      Acceptance by staff members of any honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration from non-governmental sources requires the prior approval of the  Secretary-General. Approval shall be granted only in exceptional cases and where  such acceptance is not incompatible with the interests of the Organization and with  the staff member's status as an international civil servant. If circumstances do not  allow for prior approval or if refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour  or gift, including a minor gift of essentially nominal value, would cause  __________________    h  See ST/AI/2010/1 on reporting, retaining and disposing of honours, decorations, favours, gifts or  remuneration from governmental and non-governmental sources.    ST/SGB/2016/9        31/48  16-12690    embarrassment to the Organization, staff members may receive it on behalf of the  Organization provided that it is reported and entrusted to the Secretary-General  through established procedures. See also staff regulation 1.2 (l) and the commentary  thereon.        Commentary    1.  The intended purpose of the staff regulations and rules dealing with honours,  decorations,  favours,  gifts  or  remuneration  from  governmental  and  non-governmental sources is to ensure the independence and impartiality of staff  members. Latitude is allowed in connection with such honours, decorations, etc.,  from non-governmental sources only when the prior approval of the Secretary- General is obtained for accepting an honour, decoration, favour, gift or  remuneration, as stipulated in staff rule 1.2 (m), which implements staff regulation  1.2 (l). Staff rule 1.2 (m) provides guidance on the conditions under which honours,  decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration may be accepted from non-governmental  sources (see also paras. 50 and 51 of the 2013 standards of conduct). In essence,  advance approval is required and will be granted only in exceptional cases and only  where acceptance would not compromise the interests of the Organization or the  status of the staff member as an international civil servant. The only exceptions are  situations in which obtaining prior approval is not possible, as may be the case with  honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration from Governments (see staff  regulation 1.2 (j) and (k) above) and refusal of the unanticipated honour, etc., would  cause embarrassment to the Organization. Only in such a case may the honour, etc.,  be accepted by the staff member, but only and expressly on behalf of the  Organization. Honours, decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration must in all  cases be reported to the Secretary-General and entrusted to him through the  established procedures.i   2.  Acceptance of a gift, etc., outside these parameters may result in an  instruction to the staff member to return it, unless in turn this may cause  embarrassment to the Organization. Staff members are, therefore, expected to  consult with their administering official prior to accepting any gifts, etc., under this  rule.   3.  Any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration relating to the  performance of official functions should be directed to the Organization, not to an  individual staff member, and should be so designated.         Rule 1.2 (n)      The Secretary-General may authorize staff members to accept from a  non-governmental source or a university or a related institution, academic awards,  distinctions and tokens of a commemorative or honorary character, such as scrolls,  certificates, trophies or other items of essentially nominal monetary value.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (n) provides the Secretary-General with limited authority to  allow staff members to accept certain awards, distinctions and tokens from a  non-governmental source or from a university. The rule provides that, for the  __________________    i  Ibid.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  32/48    purpose of the rule, universities or related institutions are not considered  governmental sources since, in many countries, they are not so considered and it  would be incongruous for a staff member to be authorized to accept an honorary  degree or certification from universities in some, but not all, countries. Therefore,  the Secretary-General would normally grant authorization to accept an honorary  degree or certificate from any university or related institution that is recognized as  an academic institution by the Secretary-General. For example, no approval would  be granted for honours from so-called ""diploma mills"" or institutions not  recognized by a competent national authority.         Rule 1.2 (o)      Staff members, as part of their official functions, will be expected from time to  time to attend governmental or other functions such as meetings, conferences, meals  and diplomatic receptions. Such attendance is not considered receipt of a favour,  gift or remuneration within the meaning of the Staff Regulations and Rules.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (o) addresses the issue of attendance at various official  functions. It is clear that international officials are required from time to time to  attend governmental or other luncheons, dinners and diplomatic receptions. Such  attendance will not be considered by the Secretary-General to be a favour, gift or  remuneration within the meaning of staff regulation 1.2 (j)-(l). However, such  attendance or receipt of hospitality favours from non-governmental sources is  limited under staff rule 1.2 (p) (see below).        Rule 1.2 (p)      Staff members shall not accept any gift, remuneration or favour from any  source having or seeking to have any type of contractual relationship with the  Organization.         Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (p) emphasizes the importance of staff not accepting any gift,  remuneration or favour from any source (governmental or non-governmental,  including universities) that has sought or seeks a contractual relationship with the  Organization. This includes gifts from vendors or implementing partners, such as  non-governmental organizations. The acceptance of hospitality favours from  sources that have sought or seek such contractual relations is prohibited. In  addition, for staff performing relevant functions that would enable them to influence  such contractual relations, the acceptance of any favour, including meals or  participation in a reception sponsored by a relevant party, could also be seen as  creating a possible conflict of interest under staff rule 1.2 (q) and must be avoided.         Conflict of interest        Rule 1.2 (q)      A staff member whose personal interests interfere with the performance of his  or her official duties and responsibilities or with the integrity, independence and  impartiality required by the staff member's status as an international civil servant    ST/SGB/2016/9        33/48  16-12690    shall disclose any such actual or possible interest to the head of office and, except as  otherwise authorized by the Secretary-General, formally excuse himself or herself  from participating with regard to any involvement in that matter which might give  rise to a conflict of interest situation.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (q) contains a definition of ""conflict of interest"" that is aligned  with the Staff Regulations. The objective of the provision is to compel the disclosure  and disposition of any actual or possible conflict of interest in a transparent  manner. Where a conflict is so identified, the staff member must comply with  instructions on how to resolve the matter, as all staff have the obligation to avoid  conflicts of interest. This definition is complemented by the definition set out in the  2013 standards of conduct (para. 23). See also the commentary on staff regulation  1.2 (m) above.         Rule 1.2 (r)      Pursuant to staff regulation 1.2 (n), the Secretary-General shall establish  procedures for the filing and utilization of financial disclosure statements.        Commentary      On the basis of staff rule 1.2 (r), the Secretary-General has established  procedures to implement the filing of financial disclosure statements with due regard  to the necessary confidentiality of such forms. The programme is administered by the  Ethics Office.j See also the commentary on staff regulation 1.2 (n) above.         Outside activities        Rule 1.2 (s)      Staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation or employment,  whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary-General.         Rule 1.2 (t)      Staff members shall not, except in the normal course of official duties or with  the prior approval of the Secretary-General, engage in any outside activities that  relate to the purpose, activities or interests of the United Nations. Outside activities  include but are not limited to:     (i)  Issuing statements to the press, radio or other agencies of public  information;    (ii) Accepting speaking engagements;    (iii) Taking part in film, theatre, radio or television productions;    (iv) Submitting articles, books or other material for publication, or for any  electronic dissemination.    Approval may be granted in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (p).     __________________    j  See ST/SGB/2005/22, entitled ""Ethics Office -- establishment and terms of reference"".  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  34/48        Commentary    1.  Staff rules 1.2 (s) and (t) distinguish between outside occupation or  employment and outside activities that relate to the purpose, activities or interests  of the United Nations. In either case, the staff member must request the approval of  the Secretary-General. If a request is denied, a reason for that refusal will be given  (see paras. 45-49 of the 2013 standards of conduct).  2.   Staff rule 1.2 (t) includes in its scope any type of outside activity that relates to  the purpose, activities or interests of the Organization, not limited to the list of  examples of specific events or engagements provided in the rule. Staff rule 1.2 (t) (iv)  further clarifies that the electronic dissemination of material for publication, for  example, via e-mail or on public websites, also requires the approval of the  Secretary-General. This includes contemporary means of dissemination of  information through the Internet and social media. Where approved, public  dissemination in any form must bear appropriate disclaimers, such as ""The views  expressed herein are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of  the United Nations,"" unless the staff member has been requested, as part of the  approval, not to disclose his or her affiliation with the Organization. Further, any  publication in any form that can be associated with the author as a staff member of  the Organization should bear an appropriate disclaimer.   3.  Outside activities that are of benefit to the Organization or the achievement of  its goals and contribute to the development of the professional skills of staff  members are usually not only permitted, but also encouraged, for example, the  approved publication of scholarly articles or participation in symposiums. Publicly  available statements of United Nations officials, even in their private capacity, may  have a significant impact on the image and reputation of the Organization. For  publications, approval not only for the activity as such, but also for the manuscript  prior to publication, is required if it relates to the purpose, activities or interests of  the United Nations.   4.   For approved outside activities that relate to the purpose, activities or  interests of the Organization, only subsistence allowances similar to those payable  by the United Nations may be accepted by the staff member. No other remuneration  may be accepted. This serves to support the independence and impartiality expected  of staff members when they engage in United Nations-related activities, given their  status as international civil servants (see also staff rule 1.2 (w) below).   5.   Staff members are reminded that outside activities shall not compromise the  confidentiality of the Organization's information. They shall not communicate to  any person any information known to them by reason of their official position that  has not been made public, except with the permission of the Secretary-General. This  obligation does not cease upon separation from the Organization. In this context,  staff members may be required to sign an appropriate confidentiality statement  prior to engaging in the activity or to ensure that no references to their affiliation  with the Organization will be displayed in relevant public forums.   6.   Approval is a discretionary decision by the Secretary-General and may take  into account information and assessments by the employing office or department,  the Ethics Office, the Office of Human Resources Management and/or the Office of  Legal Affairs as well as any other relevant substantive offices or departments.       ST/SGB/2016/9        35/48  16-12690        Rule 1.2 (u)      Membership in a political party is permitted, provided that such membership  does not entail action, or an obligation to take action, by the staff member contrary  to staff regulation 1.2 (h). The payment of normal financial contributions to a  political party shall not be construed as an activity inconsistent with the principles  set out in staff regulation 1.2 (h).        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (u) clarifies the staff member's rights and obligations vis-a-vis  political activities (see also paras. 48 and 49 of the 2013 standards of conduct and  the commentary on staff regulation 1.2 (h) above).        Rule 1.2 (v)      The Secretary-General shall establish procedures whereby staff may seek in  confidence clarification as to whether proposed outside activities would conflict  with their status as international civil servants.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (v) seeks to assist staff in determining whether there are conflict  situations by requiring the establishment of procedures to enable the staff to seek  confidential guidance on such issues (see also paras. 45 and 48 of the 2013  standards of conduct). Staff members may reach out to the Ethics Office for  guidance.k         Travel and per diem for outside activities        Rule 1.2 (w)      Staff members who are authorized by the Secretary-General to participate in  activities related to the work of the Organization which are organized by a  Government, intergovernmental organization, non-governmental organization or  other private source may receive from that organizing entity accommodation, travel  and subsistence allowance generally in line with those payable by the United  Nations. In such cases the daily subsistence allowance that may otherwise be  payable by the United Nations shall be reduced as envisaged in staff rule 7.10 (a).        Commentary      Staff rule 1.2 (w) addresses invitations routinely extended by Governments,  intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental institutions or other private  sources to the Secretary-General and staff members to attend conferences or  meetings or undertake other activities dealing with United Nations-related matters.  Attendance at such events is normally authorized by the Secretary-General, and the  rule reflects that current practice. It also provides an opportunity for the  Organization to save on allowances that may be payable by the Organization by  having the accommodation or travel and subsistence allowance provided by the  Government, intergovernmental organization, non-governmental organization or  private source and by reducing the travel subsistence allowance that may otherwise  __________________    k  See ST/SGB/2005/22, entitled ""Ethics Office -- establishment and terms of reference"".  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  36/48    be payable to the staff member. The rule limits the permissible compensation that  staff members may accept, when participating in United Nations-related activities,  from sources other than the United Nations for travel, accommodation and  subsistence to ensure the independence and impartiality expected of staff members,  given their status as international civil servants. In this regard, it would be  improper to accept from governmental or non-governmental sources higher levels of  compensation than are allowed by the United Nations for its staff for travel on  official business.        Staff regulation 1.3      Performance of staff        Regulation 1.3 (a)      Staff members are accountable to the Secretary-General for the proper  discharge of their functions. Staff members are required to uphold the highest  standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in the discharge of their functions.  Their performance will be appraised periodically to ensure that the required  standards of performance are met.        Commentary    1.  Much of staff regulation 1.3 deals with the standards of performance required  of staff members and provides that they will be evaluated and held accountable for  meeting the required standards established by the Charter. Since the separately  administered funds and programmes have systems for assessing performance that  are adapted to meet their special needs, the provisions of staff regulation 1.3 (a)  must remain very general. The regulation places on managers the responsibility to  make proper appraisals of performance, which reinforces the solid legislative basis  for such procedures and practices.  2.  Staff regulation 1.3 (a) makes it clear that staff members are required to  uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity in the  discharge of their functions (see Article 101 of the Charter and paras. 3-14 and 52- 54 of the 2013 standards of conduct). The regulation emphasizes the concept of  accountability for performance as a fundamental condition of service. In this  context, the General Assembly adopted a definition of accountability in its  resolution 64/259:     ""Accountability is the obligation of the Secretariat and its staff members to be  answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and to be  responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or  exception.    ""Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a  timely and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all  mandates to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental  bodies and other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all  resolutions, regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective,  accurate and timely reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship  of funds and resources; all aspects of performance, including a clearly defined  system of rewards and sanctions; and with due recognition to the important    ST/SGB/2016/9        37/48  16-12690    role of the oversight bodies and in full compliance with accepted  recommendations.""  3.  The relationship between integrity and performance is discussed in the  commentary on staff rule 1.3 (a) below.  4.  An integral part of the performance of managers is to manage properly the  human, financial and other resources entrusted to them. It should be emphasized  that the higher level of responsibility associated with the managerial functions of  managers entails a commensurate increase in their accountability for the proper  performance of all their duties in managing the human and financial resources  entrusted to them.        Regulation 1.3 (b)      The whole time of staff members shall be at the disposal of the Secretary- General for the performance of official functions. The Secretary-General shall  establish a normal working week and shall establish official holidays for each duty  station. Exceptions may be made by the Secretary-General as the needs of the  service may require, and staff members shall be required to work beyond the normal  tour of duty when requested to do so.        Commentary      Staff regulation 1.3 (b) makes it clear that, although staff normally work an  ordinary working week, they must work in excess of that working week when so  directed. Any requests to work additional hours must be reasonable and must be  related to the needs of the service.        Staff rule 1.3      Performance of staff members        Rule 1.3 (a)      Staff members shall be evaluated for their efficiency, competence and integrity  through performance appraisal mechanisms that shall assess the staff member's  compliance with the standards set out in the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules for  purposes of accountability.        Commentary    1.  Staff rule 1.3 (a) makes explicit that the efficiency, competence and integrity  required of staff by the Charter and staff regulation 1.3 (a) will be evaluated and  that they will be held accountable to maintain the required standards.  2.  Generally speaking, an appraisal relates primarily to efficiency and  competence, but integrity is part of the essential characteristic of an international  civil servant and may have an impact on the performance of official duties. For  example, abusive conduct by a staff member towards his or her colleagues is not  excused even if the staff member is efficient. On the other hand, the staff member 's  personal life is generally of no concern to a supervisor unless there is an impact on  the discharge of his or her functions or on his or her role as an international civil  servant. As noted in the 2013 standards of conduct:  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  38/48      ""4. International  civil  servants  should  share  the  vision  of  their  organizations. It is loyalty to this vision that ensures the integrity and  international outlook of international civil servants; a shared vision  guarantees that they will place the interests of their organization above their  own and use its resources in a responsible manner.    ""5. The concept of integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  embraces all aspects of an international civil servant's behaviour, including  such qualities as honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility. These  qualities are as basic as those of competence and efficiency, also enshrined in  the Charter.""  3.  It is important to note that competence and efficiency of staff include not only  the way in which they perform their tasks, but the way in which they interact with  others. As noted in the 2013 standards of conduct, the obligations of staff towards  their supervisors, and of supervisors towards their staff, are of crucial importance.  Those duties and obligations bear repeating in this commentary:    ""16. Managers and supervisors are in positions of leadership and it is their  responsibility to ensure a harmonious workplace based on mutual respect;  they should be open to all views and opinions and make sure that the merits of  staff are properly recognized. They need to provide support to them; this is  particularly important when staff are subject to criticism arising from the  performance of their duties. Managers are also responsible for guiding and  motivating their staff and promoting their development.    ""17. Managers and supervisors serve as role models and they have therefore a  special obligation to uphold the highest standards of conduct. It is quite  improper for them to solicit favours, gifts or loans from their staff; they must  act impartially, without favouritism and intimidation. In matters relating to the  appointment or career of others, international civil servants should not try to  influence colleagues for personal reasons.    ""18. Managers and supervisors should communicate effectively with their  staff and share relevant information with them. International civil servants  have a reciprocal responsibility to provide all pertinent facts and information  to their supervisors and to abide by and defend any decisions taken, even when  those do not accord with their personal views.    ""19. International civil servants must follow the instructions they receive in  connection with their official functions and, if they have doubts as to whether  an instruction is consistent with the Charter or any other constitutional  instrument, decisions of the governing bodies or administrative rules and  regulations, they should first consult their supervisors. If the international  civil servant and supervisor cannot agree, the international civil servant may  ask for written instructions. These may be challenged through the proper  institutional mechanisms, but any challenge should not delay carrying out the  instruction. International civil servants may also record their views in official  files. They should not follow verbal or written instructions that are manifestly  inconsistent with their official functions or that threaten their safety or that of  others.    ""20. International civil servants have the duty to report any breach of the  organization's regulations and rules to the official or entity within their    ST/SGB/2016/9        39/48  16-12690    organizations whose responsibility it is to take appropriate action, and to  cooperate with duly authorized audits and investigations. An international  civil servant who reports such a breach in good faith or who cooperates with  an audit or investigation has the right to be protected against retaliation for  doing so.""  4.  It should be emphasized that supervisors will be assessed not only on their  technical competence, but also on the way in which they utilize the staff placed  under their direction.        Rule 1.3 (b)      The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that appropriate learning and  development programmes are available for the benefit of staff.        Commentary      As staff are required to uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence  and integrity, it follows that during their careers the Secretary-General must seek to  ensure that staff are provided with appropriate learning and development  opportunities to assist them in meeting the challenges of responding effectively to  the changing mandates of the Organization.        Rule 1.3 (c)      Performance reports shall be prepared regularly for all staff members,  including at the Assistant Secretary-General level and above, in accordance with  procedures promulgated by the Secretary-General.        Commentary      Staff rule 1.3 (c) provides that performance appraisal will be pursuant to  procedures promulgated by the Secretary-General.        IV. Standards of conduct for the international civil service, 2013          Introduction    1.  The United Nations and the specialized agencies embody the highest  aspirations of the peoples of the world. Their aim is to save succeeding generations  from the scourge of war and to enable every man, woman and child to live in  dignity and freedom.  2.  The international civil service bears responsibility for translating these ideals  into reality. It relies on the great traditions of public administration that have grown  up in member States: competence, integrity, impartiality, independence and  discretion. But over and above this, international civil servants have a special  calling: to serve the ideals of peace, respect for fundamental rights, economic and  social progress, and international cooperation. It is therefore incumbent on  international civil servants to adhere to the highest standards of conduct; for,  ultimately, it is the international civil service that will enable the United Nations  system to bring about a just and peaceful world.    ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  40/48        Guiding principles    3.  The values that are enshrined in the United Nations organizations must also be  those that guide international civil servants in all their actions: fundamental human  rights, social justice, the dignity and worth of the human person and respect for the  equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small.   4.  International civil servants should share the vision of their organizations. It is  loyalty to this vision that ensures the integrity and international outlook of  international civil servants; a shared vision guarantees that they will place the  interests of their organization above their own and use its resources in a responsible  manner.  5.  The concept of integrity enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  embraces all aspects of an international civil servant's behaviour, including such  qualities as honesty, truthfulness, impartiality and incorruptibility. These qualities  are as basic as those of competence and efficiency, also enshrined in the Charter.  6.  Tolerance and understanding are basic human values. They are essential for  international civil servants, who must respect all persons equally, without any  distinction whatsoever. This respect fosters a climate and a working environment  sensitive to the needs of all. To achieve this in a multicultural setting calls for a  positive affirmation going well beyond passive acceptance.  7.  International loyalty means loyalty to the whole United Nations system and  not only to the organization for which one works; international civil servants have  an obligation to understand and exemplify this wider loyalty. The need for a  cooperative and understanding attitude towards international civil servants of other  United Nations organizations is obviously most important where international civil  servants of several organizations are serving in the same country or region.   8.  If the impartiality of the international civil service is to be maintained,  international civil servants must remain independent of any authority outside their  organization; their conduct must reflect that independence. In keeping with their  oath of office, they should not seek nor should they accept instructions from any  Government, person or entity external to the organization. It cannot be too strongly  stressed that international civil servants are not, in any sense, representatives of  Governments or other entities, nor are they proponents of their policies. This applies  equally to those on secondment from Governments and to those whose services  have been made available from elsewhere. International civil servants should be  constantly aware that through their allegiance to the Charter and the corresponding  instruments of each organization, member States and their representatives are  committed to respect this independent status.  9.  Impartiality implies tolerance and restraint, particularly in dealing with  political or religious convictions. While their personal views remain inviolate,  international civil servants do not have the freedom of private persons to take sides  or to express their convictions publicly on controversial matters, either individually  or as members of a group, irrespective of the medium used. This can mean that, in  certain situations, personal views should be expressed only with tact and discretion.  10. This does not mean that international civil servants have to give up their  personal political views or national perspectives. It does mean, however, that they    ST/SGB/2016/9        41/48  16-12690    must at all times maintain a broad international outlook and an understanding of the  international community as a whole.  11.  The independence of the international civil service does not conflict with, or  obscure, the fact that it is the member States that collectively make up -- in some  cases with other constituents -- the organization. Conduct that furthers good  relations with individual member States and that contributes to their trust and  confidence in the organizations' secretariat strengthens the organizations and  promotes their interest.  12. International civil servants who are responsible for projects in particular  countries or regions may be called upon to exercise special care in maintaining their  independence. At times they might receive instructions from the host country but  this should not compromise their independence. If at any time they consider that  such instructions threaten their independence, they must consult their supervisors.  13. International civil servants at all levels are accountable and answerable for all  actions carried out, as well as decisions taken, and commitments made by them in  performing their functions.  14. An international outlook stems from an understanding of and loyalty to the  objectives and purposes of the organizations of the United Nations system as set  forth in their legal instruments. It implies, inter alia, respect for the right of others to  hold different points of view and follow different cultural practices. It requires a  willingness to work without bias with persons of all nationalities, religions and  cultures; it calls for constant sensitivity as to how words and actions may look to  others. It requires avoidance of any expressions that could be interpreted as biased  or intolerant. As working methods can be different in different cultures,  international civil servants should not be wedded to the attitudes, working methods  or work habits of their own country or region.   15. Freedom from discrimination is a basic human right. International civil  servants are expected to respect the dignity, worth and equality of all people without  any distinction whatsoever. Assumptions based on stereotypes must be assiduously  avoided. One of the main tenets of the Charter is the equality of men and women,  and organizations should therefore do their utmost to promote gender equality.        Working relations    16. Managers and supervisors are in positions of leadership and it is their  responsibility to ensure a harmonious workplace based on mutual respect; they  should be open to all views and opinions and make sure that the merits of staff are  properly recognized. They need to provide support to them; this is particularly  important when staff are subject to criticism arising from the performance of their  duties. Managers are also responsible for guiding and motivating their staff and  promoting their development.  17. Managers and supervisors serve as role models and they have therefore a  special obligation to uphold the highest standards of conduct. It is quite improper  for them to solicit favours, gifts or loans from their staff; they must act impartially,  without favouritism and intimidation. In matters relating to the appointment or  career of others, international civil servants should not try to influence colleagues  for personal reasons.  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  42/48    18. Managers and supervisors should communicate effectively with their staff and  share relevant information with them. International civil servants have a reciprocal  responsibility to provide all pertinent facts and information to their supervisors and  to abide by and defend any decisions taken, even when those do not accord with  their personal views.  19. International civil servants must follow the instructions they receive in  connection with their official functions and, if they have doubts as to whether an  instruction is consistent with the Charter or any other constitutional instrument,  decisions of the governing bodies or administrative rules and regulations, they  should first consult their supervisors. If the international civil servant and  supervisor cannot agree, the international civil servant may ask for written  instructions. These may be challenged through the proper institutional mechanisms,  but any challenge should not delay carrying out the instruction. International civil  servants may also record their views in official files. They should not follow verbal  or written instructions that are manifestly inconsistent with their official functions  or that threaten their safety or that of others.  20. International civil servants have the duty to report any breach of the  organization's regulations and rules to the official or entity within their  organizations whose responsibility it is to take appropriate action, and to cooperate  with duly authorized audits and investigations. An international civil servant who  reports such a breach in good faith or who cooperates with an audit or investigation  has the right to be protected against retaliation for doing so.        Harassment and abuse of authority    21. Harassment in any shape or form is an affront to human dignity and  international civil servants must not engage in any form of harassment. International  civil servants have the right to a workplace environment free of harassment or  abuse. All organizations must prohibit any kind of harassment. Organizations have a  duty to establish rules and provide guidance on what constitutes harassment and  abuse of authority and how unacceptable behaviour will be addressed.  22. International civil servants must not abuse their authority or use their power or  position in a manner that is offensive, humiliating, embarrassing or intimidating to  another person.        Conflict of interest    23.  Conflicts of interest may occur when an international civil servant's personal  interests interfere with the performance of his/her official duties or call into  question the qualities of integrity, independence and impartiality required by the  status of an international civil servant. Conflicts of interest include circumstances in  which international civil servants, directly or indirectly, may benefit improperly, or  allow a third party to benefit improperly, from their association with their  organization. Conflicts of interest can arise from an international civil servant's  personal or familial dealings with third parties, individuals, beneficiaries, or other  institutions. If a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest does arise, the  conflict shall be disclosed, addressed and resolved in the best interest of the  organization. Questions entailing a conflict of interest can be very sensitive and  need to be treated with care.      ST/SGB/2016/9        43/48  16-12690        Disclosure of information    24.  International civil servants should avoid assisting third parties in their dealings  with their organization where this might lead to actual or perceived preferential  treatment. This is particularly important in procurement matters or when negotiating  prospective employment. At times, international civil servants may, owing to their  position or functions in accordance with the organization's policies, be required to  disclose certain personal assets if this is necessary to enable their organizations to  make sure that there is no conflict. The organizations must ensure confidentiality of  any information so disclosed, and must use it only for defined purposes or as  authorized by the international civil servant concerned. International civil servants  should also disclose in advance possible conflicts of interest that may arise in the  course of carrying out their duties and seek advice on mitigation and remediation.  They should perform their official duties and conduct their personal affairs in a  manner that preserves and enhances public confidence in their own integrity and  that of their organization.        Use of the resources of United Nations organizations    25.  International civil servants are responsible for safeguarding the resources of  United Nations organizations which are to be used for the purpose of delivering an  organization's mandate and to advance the best interests of the organization.  International civil servants shall use the assets, property, information and other  resources of their organizations for authorized purposes only and with care. Limited  personal use of the resources of an organization, such as electronic and  communications resources, may be permitted by the organization in accordance with  applicable policies.        Post-employment restrictions    26.  After leaving service with organizations of the United Nations system,  international civil servants should not take improper advantage of their former  official functions and positions, including through unauthorized use or distribution  of privileged or confidential information; nor should international civil servants,  including those working in procurement services and as requisitioning officers,  attempt to unduly influence the decisions of the organization in the interest or at the  request of third parties with a view to seeking an opportunity to be employed by  such third parties.        Role of the secretariats (headquarters and field duty stations)    27. The main function of all secretariats is to assist legislative bodies in their work  and to carry out their decisions. The executive heads are responsible for directing  and controlling the work of the secretariats. Accordingly, when submitting proposals  or advocating positions before a legislative body or committee, international civil  servants are presenting the position of the executive head, not that of an individual  or organizational unit.  28. In providing services to a legislative or representative body, international civil  servants should serve only the interests of the organization, not that of an individual  or organizational unit. It would not be appropriate for international civil servants to  prepare for government or other international civil service representatives any  speeches, arguments or proposals on questions under discussion without approval of  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  44/48    the executive head. It could, however, be quite appropriate to provide factual  information, technical advice or assistance with such tasks as the preparation of  draft resolutions.  29. It is entirely improper for international civil servants to lobby or seek support  from government representatives or members of legislative organs to obtain  advancement either for themselves or for others or to block or reverse unfavourable  decisions regarding their status. By adhering to the Charter and the constitutions of  the organizations of the United Nations system, Governments have undertaken to  safeguard the independence of the international civil service; it is therefore  understood that government representatives and members of legislative bodies will  neither accede to such requests nor intervene in such matters. The proper method for  an international civil servant to address such matters is through administrative  channels; each organization is responsible for providing these.        Staff-management relations    30. An enabling environment is essential for constructive staff-management  relations and serves the interests of the organizations. Relations between  management and staff should be guided by mutual respect. Elected staff  representatives have a cardinal role to play in the consideration of conditions of  employment and work, as well as in matters of staff welfare. Freedom of association  is a fundamental human right and international civil servants have the right to form  and join associations, unions or other groupings to promote and defend their  interests. Continuing dialogue between staff and management is indispensable.  Management should facilitate this dialogue.  31. Elected staff representatives enjoy rights that derive from their status; this may  include the opportunity to address legislative organs of their organization. These  rights should be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the Charter of the  United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international  covenants on human rights, and does not undermine the independence and integrity  of the international civil service. In using the broad freedom of expression they  enjoy, staff representatives must exercise a sense of responsibility and avoid undue  criticism of the organization.  32. Staff representatives must be protected against discriminatory or prejudicial  treatment based on their status or activities as staff representatives, both during their  term of office and after it has ended. Organizations should avoid unwarranted  interference in the administration of their staff unions or associations.        Relations with member States and legislative bodies    33. It is the clear duty of all international civil servants to maintain the best  possible relations with Governments and avoid any action that might impair this.  They should not interfere in the policies or affairs of Governments. It is  unacceptable for them, either individually or collectively, to criticize or try to  discredit a Government. At the same time, it is understood that international civil  servants may speak freely in support of their organizations' policies. Any activity,  direct or indirect, to undermine or overthrow a Government constitutes serious  misconduct.    ST/SGB/2016/9        45/48  16-12690    34. International civil servants are not representatives of their countries, nor do  they have authority to act as liaison agents between organizations of the United  Nations system and their Governments. The executive head may, however, request  an international civil servant to undertake such duties, a unique role for which  international loyalty and integrity are essential. For their part, neither Governments  nor organizations should place international civil servants in a position where their  international and national loyalties may conflict.         Relations with the public    35. For an organization of the United Nations system to function successfully, it  must have the support of the public. All international civil servants therefore have a  continuing responsibility to promote a better understanding of the objectives and  work of their organizations. This requires them to be well informed of the  achievements of their own organizations and to familiarize themselves with the  work of the United Nations system as a whole.  36. There is a risk that on occasion international civil servants may be subject to  criticism from outside their organizations; in keeping with their responsibility as  international civil servants, they should respond with tact and restraint. It is the  obligation of their organizations to defend them against criticism for actions taken  in fulfilment of their duties.  37. It would not be proper for international civil servants to air personal  grievances or criticize their organizations in public. International civil servants  should endeavour at all times to promote a positive image of the international civil  service, in conformity with their oath of loyalty.        Relations with the media    38. Openness and transparency in relations with the media are effective means of  communicating the organizations' messages. The organizations should have  guidelines and procedures in place for which the following principles should apply:  international civil servants should regard themselves as speaking in the name of  their organizations and avoid personal references and views; in no circumstances  should they use the media to further their own interests, to air their own grievances,  to reveal unauthorized information or to attempt to influence their organizations'  policy decisions.        Use and protection of information    39. Because disclosure of confidential information may seriously jeopardize the  efficiency and credibility of an organization, international civil servants are  responsible for exercising discretion in all matters of official business. They must  not divulge confidential information without authorization. International civil  servants should not use information to personal advantage that has not been made  public and is known to them by virtue of their official position. These obligations do  not cease upon separation from service. Organizations must maintain guidelines for  the use and protection of confidential information, and it is equally necessary for  such guidelines to keep pace with developments in communications and other new  technology. It is understood that these provisions do not affect established practices  governing the exchange of information between the secretariats and member States,  ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  46/48    which ensure the fullest participation of member States in the life and work of the  organizations.        Respect for different customs and culture    40. The world is home to a myriad of different peoples, languages, cultures,  customs and traditions. A genuine respect for them all is a fundamental requirement  for an international civil servant. Any behaviour that is not acceptable in a particular  cultural context must be avoided. However, if a tradition is directly contrary to any  human rights instrument adopted by the United Nations system, the international  civil servant must be guided by the latter. International civil servants should avoid  an ostentatious lifestyle and any display of an inflated sense of personal importance.        Security and safety    41. While an executive head assigns staff in accordance with the exigencies of the  service, it is the responsibility of organizations to ensure that the health, well-being,  security and lives of their staff, without any discrimination whatsoever, will not be  subject to undue risk. The organizations should take measures to protect the safety  of their staff and that of their family members. At the same time, it is incumbent on  international civil servants to comply with all instructions designed to protect their  safety.        Personal conduct    42. The private life of international civil servants is their own concern and  organizations should not intrude upon it. There can be situations, however, in which  the behaviour of an international civil servant may reflect on the organization.  International civil servants must therefore bear in mind that their conduct and  activities outside the workplace, even if unrelated to official duties, can compromise  the image and the interests of the organizations. This can also result from the  conduct of members of international civil servants' households and it is the  responsibility of international civil servants to make sure that their households are  fully aware of this.  43. The privileges and immunities that international civil servants enjoy are  conferred upon them solely in the interests of the organizations. They do not exempt  international civil servants from observing local laws, nor do they provide an excuse  for ignoring private legal or financial obligations. It should be remembered that only  the executive head is competent to waive the immunity accorded to international  civil servants or to determine its scope.  44. Violations of the law can range from serious criminal activities to trivial  offences, and organizations may be called upon to exercise judgment depending on  the nature and circumstances of individual cases. A conviction by a national court  will usually, although not always, be persuasive evidence of the act for which an  international civil servant was prosecuted; acts that are generally recognized as  offences by national criminal laws will normally also be considered violations of the  standards of conduct for the international civil service.         ST/SGB/2016/9        47/48  16-12690        Outside employment and activities    45. The primary obligation of international civil servants is to devote their  energies to the work of their organizations. Therefore, international civil servants  should not engage, without prior authorization, in any outside activity, whether  remunerated or not, that interferes with that obligation or is incompatible with their  status or conflicts with the interests of the organization. Any questions about this  should be referred to the executive head.  46. Subject to the above, outside activities may, of course, be beneficial both to  staff members and to their organizations. Organizations should allow, encourage and  facilitate the participation of international civil servants in professional activities  that foster contacts with private and public bodies and thus serve to maintain and  enhance their professional and technical competencies.  47. International civil servants on leave, whether with or without pay, should bear  in mind that they remain international civil servants in the employ of their  organization and remain subject to its rules. They may, therefore, accept  employment, paid or unpaid, during their leave only with proper authorization.  48. In view of the independence and impartiality that they must maintain,  international civil servants, while retaining the right to vote, should not participate  in political activities, such as standing for or holding local or national political  office. This does not, however, preclude participation in local community or civic  activities, provided that such participation is consistent with the oath of service in  the United Nations system. It is necessary for international civil servants to exercise  discretion in their support for a political party or campaign, and they should not  accept or solicit funds, write articles or make public speeches or statements to the  press. These cases require the exercise of judgment and, in case of doubt, should be  referred to the executive head.  49. The significance of membership in a political party varies from country to  country and it is difficult to formulate standards that will apply in all cases. In  general, international civil servants may be members of a political party, provided  its prevailing views and the obligations imposed on its members are consistent with  the oath of service in the United Nations system.        Gifts, honours and remuneration from outside sources    50. To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety,  international civil servants must not accept, without authorization from the  executive head, any honour, decoration, gift, remuneration, favour or economic  benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations;  it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and  other entities.  51. International civil servants should not accept supplementary payments or other  subsidies from a Government or any other source prior to, during or after their  assignment with an organization of the United Nations system if the payment is  related to that assignment. Balancing this requirement, it is understood that  Governments or other entities, recognizing that they are at variance with the spirit  of the Charter and the constitutions of the organizations of the United Nations  system, should not make or offer such payments.    ST/SGB/2016/9      16-12690  48/48        Conclusion    52. The attainment of the standards of conduct for the international civil service  requires the highest commitment of all parties. International civil servants must be  committed to the values, principles and standards set forth herein. They are  expected to uphold them in a positive and active manner. They should feel  responsible for contributing to the broad ideals to which they dedicated themselves  in joining the United Nations system. Organizations have the obligation to  implement these standards through their policy framework, including rules,  regulations and other administrative instruments. For their part, member States are  expected, through their allegiance to the Charter and other constituent instruments,  to preserve the independence and impartiality of the international civil service.  53. For these standards to be effectively applied, it is essential that they be widely  disseminated and that measures be taken and mechanisms put in place to ensure that  their scope and importance are understood throughout the international civil service,  the member States and the organizations of the United Nations system.  54. Respect for these standards assures that the international civil service will  continue to be an effective instrument in fulfilling its responsibilities and in meeting  the aspirations of the peoples of the world.    16-12690 (E)    290716  *1612690*    "

Introduction      1.  The present report is submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to resolution  63/276. It responds in particular to the issues raised in paragraph 9 of the resolution,  which are listed below and which, for ease of reference, form the basic structure of  this report:    (a)  Definition of accountability and roles and responsibilities;    (b)  Performance reporting;    (c)  Implementation of the recommendations of oversight bodies;    (d)  Personal and institutional accountability;    (e)  Selection and appointment of senior managers;    (f)  Reform of the performance appraisal system;    (g)  Delegation of authority;    (h)  Implementation of the results-based management framework;     (i)  Results-based management information system;    (j)  Enterprise risk management and internal control framework;    (k)  How the current and proposed accountability mechanisms would have  addressed the flaws in the management of the oil-for-food programme.  2.  In the past four years, the Secretariat has submitted three reports on  accountability in the United Nations Secretariat,1 in which governance and  oversight in the United Nations was reviewed and the larger accountability  framework of the Secretariat was discussed. I share the belief of Member States that  accountability is a central pillar of effective and efficient management that requires  attention at the highest level. I wish to reiterate that I remain fully committed to  advancing the capacity of the Organization in this regard. I also note the significant  progress that has been made on accountability matters in recent years. Achievements  include the establishment of the Ethics Office of the United Nations Secretariat; the  promulgation of an effective whistleblower protection policy; the implementation of  a rigorous financial disclosure programme; the introduction of a new internal justice  system; and the strengthening of the independent oversight bodies, including the  establishment of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee. The Secretariat has  also been working constantly to increase its accountability for delivering results, at  both the staff and organizational levels, for example by publishing the compacts of  senior managers and the annual assessments of their performance towards achieving  the objectives contained therein, as well as issuing and publishing on the Secretariat  Intranet an interim programme performance report covering the first year of the  biennium 2008-2009.   __________________    1 Report of the Secretary-General on measures to strengthen accountability at the United Nations  (A/60/312); report of the Secretary-General on the comprehensive review of governance and  oversight within the United Nations and its funds, programmes and specialized agencies  (A/60/883 and Add.1 and 2 and Add.1/Corr.1; and report of the Secretary-General on an  accountability framework, enterprise risk management and internal control framework, and  results-based management framework (A/62/701 and Corr.1 and Add.1).  A/64/640      10-22371  4    3.  Nevertheless, more remains to be done. General Assembly resolution  63/276 requires me to present clear measures and make concrete proposals on a  range of issues. Wherever possible, I offer such recommendations in the present  report and provide information on the most relevant actions taken at the strategic  and policy level on matters under my purview since the issuance of my previous  report (A/62/701 and Corr.1).  4.  In some instances, however, I believe it is important to take a step back and  review the existing structures, both in their ideal and current state, to better  understand the foundation on which the organizational accountability system rests.  The planning and reporting documents, in particular the strategic framework, the  programme budget, the peacekeeping budgets and the performance reports,  constitute a sine qua non for effective accountability. We need to forge a clear and  common understanding of the expected accomplishments and objectives that  Member States set for the Organization in order to align the processes, outputs and  services of the Secretariat. Without the programme, planning and budget documents  effectively guiding the way, other improvements further downstream may fall short  of expectations.  5.  In the present report, I outline the weaknesses of existing structures and  suggest how they might be remedied. For ease of reference and to put these  recommendations in context, I have included an overview of the current  accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat in annex I. A detailed plan  and road map for the implementation of the enterprise risk management and internal  control framework that I propose is contained in annex II. Annex III contains an  overview of the actions taken by the Secretariat to strengthen its accountability  mechanisms in response to the weaknesses identified by the Independent Inquiry  Committee in terms of internal monitoring, inspection and accountability regarding  the management of the oil-for-food programme.   6.  The challenge before us is formidable: strengthening an accountability system  in an organization as complex as the United Nations is a daunting task and a  continuous process. There is no predetermined finishing line and no set path on how  best to proceed, as objectives and standards are likely to evolve over time in a  system that itself keeps changing to meet the growing needs of the Organization. All  stakeholders must work together in defining the components of our joint  accountability system, identifying the areas that need strengthening and committing  themselves to a process of continuous improvement.  7.  As part of the consultation process I initiated in preparation for the present  report, the Secretariat over the course of three months held more than 15 informal  meetings with Member States, senior staff of the Secretariat and representatives  from the United Nations system to discuss its content. The present report captures  the essence of the ideas raised in our exchanges that related to the issue of  accountability. It is my sincere hope that the report will help to advance our ongoing  dialogue and move us forward on the path towards a more accountable United  Nations.     A/64/640   5  10-22371      II. Issues raised in paragraph 9 of General Assembly   resolution 63/276        A. Definition of accountability and roles and responsibilities      8.  The basic principles that provide the framework for accountability at the  United Nations are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which stipulates  the purposes and principles of the United Nations and identifies the principal organs  and their roles and responsibilities.   9.  Under the Charter, it is the prerogative of Member States to provide mandates  to the Secretariat through the resolutions and decisions emanating from the United  Nations principal organs. Further, the Charter establishes that the Secretary-General  is the Chief Administrative Officer of the United Nations (Article 97) and that the  mandates promulgated by the principal organs of the United Nations are entrusted to  him for implementation (Article 98). Accordingly, the Secretary-General is  accountable to the Member States for the implementation of those mandates.   10. Pursuant to resolution 63/276, and after considering definitions of  accountability by other United Nations entities,2 I would like to propose the  following definition:     Accountability is the obligation of the Organization and its staff members to  be answerable for delivering specific results that have been determined  through a clear and transparent assignment of responsibility, subject to the  availability of resources and the constraints posed by external factors.  Accountability includes achieving objectives and results in response to  mandates, fair and accurate reporting on performance results, stewardship of  funds, and all aspects of performance in accordance with regulations, rules and  standards, including a clearly defined system of rewards and sanctions.  11. Applied to the context of the United Nations, I understand this definition to  imply a number of obligations for the United Nations Secretariat, namely:    (a)  To conduct its work with a view to achieving the objectives and results  established through clear mandates of Member States;     (b)  To report fairly and accurately on performance results vis-a-vis mandated  roles, plans and activities;    (c)  To conduct its work in accordance with United Nations regulations, rules  and procedures;  __________________    2  The United Nations Development Programme uses the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development definition of accountability, which is ""the obligation to demonstrate that work  has been conducted in compliance with agreed rules and standards or to report fairly and  accurately on performance results vis-a-vis mandated roles and/or plans"". The definition by the  United Nations Population Fund is as follows: ""Accountability is the process whereby public  service organizations and individuals within them are held responsible for their decisions and  actions, including their stewardship of public funds, fairness, and all aspects of performance, in  accordance with agreed rules and standards, and fair and accurate reporting on performance  results vis-a-vis mandated roles and/or plans."" The United Nations Children's Fund uses the  following definition: ""Accountability is the obligation to demonstrate that work has been  conducted in accordance with agreed rules and standards, and that performance results have  been reported fairly and accurately.""  A/64/640      10-22371  6      (d)  To ensure that staff members adhere to the highest level of integrity and  ethical standards expected of an international civil servant;     (e)  To clearly specify and enforce a system of rewards for outstanding  performance and sanctions for non-performance.  12. The point of departure for operationalizing the concept of accountability is the  agreement, in essence a covenant, between Member States and the Secretariat  expressed in the strategic framework, the programme budget and the peacekeeping  budgets. Member States provide the mandates for what the United Nations aspires to  achieve in a given cycle with the resources appropriated. The Secretariat is obliged  to deliver the results established thereby, subject to availability of resources and  constraints posed by external factors beyond its control.   13. These objectives and results are obtained, inter alia, through the work of its  staff, who are obliged to adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct. In this  process, the Secretariat is required to respect rules and regulations and to follow a  set of procedures that guarantee its proper functioning. The internal and external  oversight bodies seek to provide assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of  these processes through independent and objective assessment.  14. The accountability structure of the Organization rests on six components:     (a)  The Charter of the United Nations;    (b)  The strategic framework, the programme budget and the peacekeeping  budgets (the covenant);     (c)  Delivery of results and performance (including a system of rewards and  sanctions);     (d)  Internal systems and controls;     (e)  Ethical standards and integrity;     (f)  Oversight roles and functions.  15. The interrelationships among these components and in  the larger  accountability structure of the Secretariat are reflected in the chart below.                             A/64/640   7  10-22371        Figure   Accountability structure                                              16. It is my sincere hope that the broad consultations held by the Secretariat in  preparation for the present report have forged a common understanding of the  existing structures and will allow the Organization to take the above definition of  accountability as an agreed point of departure for future efforts to strengthen  accountability in the Secretariat.3         B. Performance reporting      17. The Secretariat reports its performance to the General Assembly in the context  of the established objectives of programme budgets at the end of every biennium (or  the budget year) through the programme performance report, or in the case of  departments and offices funded by the support account and peacekeeping missions,  through annual performance reports. The programme performance report contains a  description of progress towards achieving objectives and expected accomplishments  by each programme, as well as explanations for any deviations or lack of progress  where applicable.   __________________    3  For a detailed description of the components of the current accountability system, see annex I.          A/64/640      10-22371  8    18. Over the years, the General Assembly has made a number of recommendations  on the format of the programme performance report and the support account and  peacekeeping mission annual performance reports. These recommendations call for  a better qualitative assessment of programme implementation and for reporting that  is more closely aligned with the objectives, expected accomplishments and  indicators of achievement (see resolution 61/235 and 59/275).   19. To strengthen the quality of performance reporting, three systemic issues need  to be addressed:     (a)  The formulation of the logical frameworks;    (b)  The timing of the issuance of programme performance reports;     (c)  The capacity of the current management information systems to link  results achieved to resources used.   20. The logical frameworks that are at the core of the programme planning and  budgeting process are sometimes poorly formulated. The broad strategic objectives  and priorities of the Organization are often not linked to those at the lower levels  and are not clearly formulated or attainable. Expected accomplishments and  associated indicators of achievement are sometimes formulated at the level of  activities and outputs and do not necessarily lend themselves to the achievement of  established objectives. Indicators of achievement do not always constitute  meaningful performance measures. External factors are not based on an appropriate  risk assessment.4  21. Issuing the programme performance report at the end of the first quarter of the  year following the biennium reduces its usefulness to Member States for budgetary  decision-making, as it becomes available only after decisions have already been  taken in relation to the next biennium. I note that the assessment presented by the  Secretariat to Member States at the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly  still stands: that ""the existing systems for reporting and evaluating the performance  of programmes have no practical impact on future plans and resource allocation  decisions"" (A/57/387 and Corr.1, para. 164).   22. Finally, the current information management systems do not link information  on results to resources used at the programme or subprogramme levels. This  disconnect renders it difficult for Member States to estimate the costs associated  with implementing mandates or reaching specific results. A tool to address this  issue, a results-based management module, will be included in the Umoja  (enterprise resource planning) system.  __________________    4  Some of these weaknesses have been described in previous reports of the Secretary-General and  the oversight bodies, such as the report of the Secretary-General on an accountability  framework, enterprise risk management and internal control framework, and results-based  management framework (A/62/701 and Corr.1); the report of the Office of Internal Oversight  Services on its review of results-based management at the United Nations (A/63/268), which  concluded that ""Results-based management at the United Nations has been an administrative  chore of little value to accountability and decision-making""; the report of the Joint Inspection  Unit on an evaluation of results-based budgeting in peacekeeping operations (JIU/REP/2006/1,  see A/60/709); and the series of reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on managing for results in  the United Nations system (JIU/REP/2004/5, JIU/REP/2004/6, JIU/REP/2004/7,  JIU/REP/2004/8 and JIU/REP/2006/6, see A/59/607, A/59/617, A/59/631, A/59/632 and  A/61/805).    A/64/640   9  10-22371        Recommendation      To enable more performance-informed decision-making by Member States  regarding programme plans and budgets, I produced as a pilot an interim  programme performance report covering the first year of the biennium  2008-2009. I propose to supplement the comprehensive biennial  programme performance report with an interim report on the progress  made by the Secretariat towards achievement of expected results at the  end of the first year of each biennium.   23. It should be noted, however, that the implementation of this recommendation  would be most effective if the underlying problems with the logical frameworks, on  which the programme performance report is based, could first be addressed, so that  the information provided through the report would help Member States to determine  whether the Organization is meeting its objectives.        Recommendation      I request Member States to continue supporting the implementation of the  Umoja (enterprise resource planning) project, which incorporates, inter alia,  the development of interoperable information management tools needed to  effectively support results-based budgeting and eventually results-based  management.         C. Implementation of the recommendations of oversight bodies      24. Oversight bodies have an important role to play in promoting a culture of  compliance and integrity and in deterring mismanagement. They provide critical  support to managers by independently assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of  internal systems and controls. It is my firm belief that an important responsibility of  managers in the Organization is to implement all accepted recommendations of the  oversight bodies. The Management Committee has been charged with overseeing  compliance in this regard.5   25. The Department of Management monitors departmental implementation of  oversight recommendations and reports the implementation status to the  Management Committee on a quarterly basis. The reports of the oversight bodies are  also provided to the Committee for Programme and Coordination, the Advisory  Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the General Assembly.  In addition, the budget fascicles include a section reflecting actions taken by  departments in response to oversight recommendations. This enables Member States  to make informed decisions with regard to the accomplishments of the Organization  and its level of compliance with rules, policies and procedures.  26. The Organization is fully committed to implementing the recommendations of  the oversight bodies. I am pleased to report that we are beginning to see a positive  __________________    5  In order to ensure timely implementation of oversight body recommendations, the Secretariat  added to the core functions of the Management Committee the responsibility to ""ensure that  findings and recommendations of the Board of Auditors, the Joint Inspection Unit and the Office  of Internal Oversight Services are effectively fed into the executive management processes, and  that accepted recommendations are followed up and implemented in a timely manner""  (ST/SGB/2006/14).  A/64/640      10-22371  10    trend in the rate of implementation of such recommendations. It should be noted that  there is a formal process by which recommendations are accepted or not by  management. When they are not accepted, the relevant manager must provide a  compelling explanation for non-acceptance. It might be that the oversight body  insists on the need to implement these recommendations. In cases where  management and the relevant oversight body continue to disagree, the case is raised  to the Management Committee for a decision. To allow the Management Committee  to take an informed decision and determine a possible course of action, I intend to  require a mandatory risk assessment of the potential impact of non-acceptance of a  recommendation. This assessment will be done in the context of the proposed  enterprise risk management framework, as described in section J of the present  report. I shall emphasize that the responsibility for the risk of non-implementation  rests with management.  27. In keeping with the high premium I and Member States place on the timely  implementation of oversight recommendations, and to improve the management of  the Organization in this critical area, the Management Committee in 2009 initiated a  more direct engagement and strengthened dialogue with all the oversight bodies.  ""Dialogue meetings"" were held in 2009 with the Board of Auditors, the Office of  Internal Oversight Services and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee. In  early 2010, the Committee will meet with the Joint Inspection Unit.   28. These meetings were the first time that senior management had directly  engaged the oversight bodies in a discussion and sharing of perspectives on  oversight issues of mutual concern in this collaborative setting. Among the issues  discussed  were  management  concerns  regarding  the  sheer  volume  of  recommendations as well as duplication of recommendations among oversight  bodies, and systemic risks and deficiencies encountered in the work of the oversight  bodies.   29. The dialogue has been well received by the oversight bodies as a ""significant  development"" in terms of their relationship with senior management and their  reporting responsibilities to the General Assembly. Expected outcomes from this  first series of dialogue meetings include an identification and assessment of  systemic risks and deficiencies faced by the Organization and a plan by management  to address them.   30. In support of this dialogue, the Department of Management intends to conduct  reviews of the systemic risks identified and of which risks might benefit from  systemic solutions. Systemic analyses will then provide the basis for more  comprehensive solutions to Secretariat-wide issues and weaknesses and will  broaden the scope of monitoring that is currently somewhat fragmented, as it is  derived from data gathered at the level of each individual Department.   31. To strengthen the oversight regime further, the General Assembly, in its  resolution 60/248, established the Independent Audit Advisory Committee as a  subsidiary body of the Assembly to serve in an advisory capacity and to assist the  Assembly in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. By resolution 61/275, the terms  of reference of the Committee were approved, including that the Committee will  advise the Assembly on measures to ensure the compliance of management with  audit and other oversight recommendations.    A/64/640   11  10-22371    32. In June 2008, the Chair of the Management Committee wrote to the Chair of  the Independent Audit Advisory Committee stating that the Management Committee  was the high-level mechanism established under my authority to effectively feed the  findings and recommendations of the oversight bodies into the executive  management processes. The Chair of the Management Committee also pledged the  support and cooperation of that Committee in supporting the work of the Audit  Advisory Committee in its important advisory role for the General Assembly. In  2010, the Management Committee intends to issue a quarterly communication to the  Chair of the Advisory Committee on progress in implementing oversight  recommendations.        Recommendations      I encourage Member States to continue supporting the work of the  oversight bodies of the United Nations, as they play an important role in  promoting a culture of compliance and integrity and in deterring  mismanagement in the United Nations.    I also encourage Member States to continue supporting the work of the  Management Committee in feeding the findings and recommendations of  the oversight bodies into the executive management processes, in ensuring  the timely follow-up and implementation of those recommendations and in  strengthening the dialogue with the oversight bodies initiated in 2009.         D. Personal and institutional accountability      33. The critical linkage between institutional accountability and individual  accountability is established through the workplans contained in the annual  performance compacts for senior managers and the performance appraisal system6  for staff at all levels below that of the Assistant Secretary-General. Responsibility  for results consistent with the approved organizational goals and objectives will thus  cascade down through these workplans of successive levels of managers and staff.   34. These interlinked and cascading agreements between staff and managers  constitute the fundamental and essential building blocks for holding staff  accountable for the achievement of specific results. It is a basic tenet of  accountability that each manager or staff member must have relevant resources at  his or her disposal, and must have adequate authority and control over those  resources to achieve the mandated results. As stated in a previous report on  accountability, ""accountability will be in direct proportion to the responsibility  assigned and the authority delegated"" (A/C.5/49/1).  35. Member States may recall that I have strengthened the system of compacts  with senior managers over the past several years. In 2008, I extended the use of  these compacts to include the Assistant Secretary-General level. Subsequently, I  made the individual performance assessments available on the Secretariat Intranet to  increase transparency to a level that I believe is unprecedented among international  organizations. Starting in 2010 and following a recommendation by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services, I will sign compacts with my special representatives  __________________    6  The reform of performance appraisal mechanisms is discussed separately in section F of the  present report.  A/64/640      10-22371  12    and heads of mission in field operations led by the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations, the Department of Field Support and the Department of Political  Affairs. The compacts will serve as a mechanism to measure their performance and  ensure a clear reporting line and accountability.   36. I believe it is critical to improve the integration of the objectives in the senior  managers' compacts with the overall objectives of the Organization. As  departmental performance should reflect that of the senior manager, I intend to  institute a mechanism to review the programme performance report and the senior  managers' compacts simultaneously by the Management Performance Board. To that  end, I have amended the terms of reference of that Board to include the review of  the programme performance report as one of its functions, in order to establish a  link between the performance of individual senior managers and that of her or his  department or office.   37. Furthermore, I have instructed the Department of Management to explore ways  and means to relate the findings and decisions of the new system of administration  of justice to the performance assessments of managers and staff at all levels. I also  hope to use that information to identify and address systemic managerial issues  affecting the performance of the entire Organization. The process will serve as a  mechanism to monitor the use of decision-making authority by staff at all levels,  and to reflect it in their performance appraisals and human resource action plans,  when appropriate. For example, if a pattern of wrongful or improper decisions taken  by the same manager is identified, I will take appropriate action to ensure that the  responsible staff member is held accountable.   38. In addition, in the context of the proposed global field support strategy (see  A/64/633), to be considered by the General Assembly later in 2010, consideration  will be given to measures aimed at developing a culture of greater empowerment,  accompanied by a more robust accountability framework for staff in the field with  management and administrative responsibilities.  39. The administrative instruction on the performance appraisal system and the  accompanying guidelines for using the system provide details of the individual  assessment process, as well as actions to be taken in cases of poor performance.  These actions range from developing a performance improvement plan to  termination for unsatisfactory service.   40. At present, individual staff members are recognized for satisfactory  performance by receiving a within-grade salary increment. However, there are very  few mechanisms for recognizing or rewarding high-performing individuals. After a  comprehensive review and broad consultations throughout the Secretariat earlier  this year, I have authorized a reoriented UN 21 awards programme that will  recognize outstanding initiatives by an individual or a team of individuals. The  revised programme will follow a two-tiered approach that consists of a centralized  and streamlined UN 21 awards programme and a decentralized recognition  programme that heads of departments and offices can institute within their area of  responsibility. Nominations for the 2010 UN 21 awards will be submitted in three  categories: (a) climate change/greening the United Nations; (b) improvements in  client services; and (c) inter-departmental initiatives. Special emphasis will be  placed on contributions that further the objectives of the United Nations, show  significant impact and innovation, and serve as good practices for the Organization.    A/64/640   13  10-22371    41. Institutional performance is monitored and reported to Member States through  the programme performance report (see sect. B). Other related issues, such as those  regarding the strategic framework and the linkage between performance and  resource allocation, are discussed in section H, on results-based management.        E. Selection and appointment of senior managers      42. Under General Assembly resolution 51/226, Member States have entrusted me  with the discretionary authority to appoint staff at the level of Under-Secretary- General and Assistant Secretary-General, as well as special envoys at all levels. I  have exercised this authority voluntarily with great care to ensure transparency and  maintain the institutional safeguards of the process, while protecting the privacy of  the applicants.   43. The main steps of the selection and appointment process are as follows:     (a)  Upcoming openings are reviewed on an ongoing basis in order to  commence the required selection process in a timely manner;     (b)  Predetermined criteria, against which the candidates are to be reviewed,  are established and reflected in the terms of reference of the interview panel and  conveyed to the Member States when soliciting nominations;     (c)  In order to ensure a diverse pool of qualified candidates for such  positions, a notification is sent to Member States through a note verbale and an  advertisement is placed in suitable print media and United Nations websites, as  needed, to complement my own search efforts;     (d)  In keeping with my desire to have a rigorous selection process, the  consideration of the candidates includes review and advice by a panel of senior  United Nations officials with relevant knowledge and experience drawn from the  United Nations Secretariat and/or the funds and programmes, as well as outside  experts as deemed necessary;    (e)  At the conclusion of the process, the most suitable final candidates, of  which at least one is a woman, are submitted to me for final decision;     (f)  I personally interview the finalists, as appropriate, prior to making my  decision;     (g)  For some positions, consultation with intergovernmental bodies is  required and conducted accordingly.  44. This clear approach enhances objectivity by recommending to me an inclusive  and well-considered shortlist of senior personalities both inside and outside the  Organization. It also enhances transparency by bringing to the attention of the  Member States upcoming openings in a timely manner. It further aims to enable me  to select the most competent candidates with due regard for geographical  distribution and the gender representation of the Organization.         F. Reform of the performance appraisal system      45. The performance appraisal system is meant to link programmes mandated by  the General Assembly to departmental, divisional, sectional and, finally, individual  A/64/640      10-22371  14    workplans, constituting a fundamental accountability mechanism within the  Organization. The system establishes each individual's contribution to and  accountability for the achievement of agreed results. It allows individual goals to be  clarified at the beginning of the cycle in the workplan, keep performance on track  through ongoing dialogue, and evaluate performance at the end of the cycle.   46. The performance appraisal system currently used in the Organization suffers  from weaknesses that hamper its effectiveness including:    (a)  Inconsistency in the interpretation or application of the rating scales;    (b)  Insufficient linkage to learning, career development and succession  planning;    (c)  Knowledge gaps among staff and managers regarding the performance  management system;     (d)  Uneven compliance with the performance appraisal system by staff and  managers;     (e)  Technical difficulties in accessing the performance appraisal system  electronic tool remotely.  47. Pending a comprehensive revision of the performance management system, the  Department of Management is taking a number of short-term measures to strengthen  the performance appraisal mechanism. The Office of Human Resources  Management is spearheading the development of a new electronic performance  management tool as part of the talent management system, which is scheduled to be  launched on 1 April 2010.   48. The issue of performance management is also related to the culture of the  Organization, extending beyond the mere systems and tools available for assessing  staff performance. I intend to promote a cultural change within the Organization  whereby staff understand that they will be held accountable for the quality and  timely delivery of their work and supervisors understand they will be held  accountable for effectively managing their staff towards that end. Training will be  essential to effect this cultural change.  49. Mandatory training on performance management will be instituted for all staff  and managers, particularly those who supervise the work of others. Specific  performance management components, such as providing feedback, setting goals  and objectives, and addressing underperformance, are being reinforced in additional  learning sessions. I am confident that these measures will equip staff and managers  with the requisite skills to manage performance more effectively.   50. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/250, I will be submitting a  separate report to the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session on the reform of the  performance appraisal system. Benefiting from broad consultations among all  stakeholders that are currently still under way, the proposal will explore various  issues, such as a possible 180/360 degree feedback mechanism, a strategy for  mandatory performance training for managers and supervisors, strengthening the  role of the Management Review Committee and the Joint Monitoring Committee  (see ST/AI/2002/3) and creative ways to reward, recognize and motivate staff and  strengthen the remedies to address underperformance.         A/64/640   15  10-22371      G. Delegation of authority       51. Over the years my efforts to enhance accountability have been based on the  premise that giving managers more authority and responsibility for decision-making  is essential in order to improve the management of human and financial resources.  As Secretary-General, I have requested the Deputy Secretary-General to oversee  various administrative aspects of the Organization and to act on my behalf in this  regard. I have also delegated financial, human resources management and  procurement authority to heads of departments, offices, missions and tribunals  through the Under-Secretary-General for Management (see ST/AI/2004/1 and  ST/SGB/151). The granting of this latter authority is conveyed in a communication  that defines its scope, expectations regarding its discharge and the manner in which  it will be monitored. The Department of Management is responsible for monitoring  the exercise of authority in these areas and for assisting staff to carry out their  responsibilities properly. If deemed necessary, the level of authority can be reduced  or the authority withdrawn. The delegation of authority entails the exercise of  responsibility for ensuring full implementation of the relevant regulations and rules  of the United Nations and related administrative instructions, an example of which  is the delegation of financial authority, as laid out in administrative instruction  ST/AI/2004/1. This delegation of authority is personal and the individual to whom  authority is delegated is directly responsible to the Assistant Secretaries-General in  each of the functional areas, to the Under-Secretary-General for Management, and  ultimately to me.  52. The challenge of monitoring delegation of authority in various areas has grown  in tandem with the increase in Secretariat operations and field missions over the  years. The difficulties stem from inadequate management information systems that  do not backstop the delegation process in a user-friendly and efficient manner. This  has added cumbersome processes to the system of delegation of authority, and  serious efforts are under way to streamline the current arrangements and strengthen  accountability. I intend to clarify the responsibilities of all involved and streamline  the mechanisms for effective and efficient delegation of authority by drawing on  recommendations of the oversight bodies in this regard.7 These include a clear  vertical chain of command, effective policies to guide delegation of authority,  provision of efficient systems of support, a central repository of all delegations, and  continuous performance assessment.  53. In addition, I have instructed the Department of Management to lead an  interdepartmental effort, to review and update the other types of delegation of  authority existing in the Secretariat (substantive, institutional and by designation) to  specify clear responsibilities in these areas and to achieve more efficiency in the  implementation of these delegations of authority.        H. Implementation of the results-based management framework      54. The concept of results-based management was first introduced in the  Secretariat by the Joint Inspection Unit, which included as part of its definition of  results-based management not only the process of planning, programming,  __________________    7  Audit report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on management of delegation of  authority (AH2007/510/1) and Joint Inspection Unit report (JIU/REP/2004/7, see A/59/631).  A/64/640      10-22371  16    budgeting and evaluation, but also issues such as delegation of authority,  accountability, staff performance management and contracts. The Joint Inspection  Unit produced a series of reports on management for results8 that were presented to  the Committee for Programme and Coordination at its forty-fifth session. The  conclusions and recommendations of the Committee at that session were endorsed  by the General Assembly in resolution 60/257. It should also be recalled that the  Assembly, in paragraph 3 of resolution 63/276, endorsed the conclusions and  recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions and that the Advisory Committee, in paragraph 38 of its report  (A/63/457), recommended to the Assembly that it should endorse my proposal (see  A/62/701 and Corr.1, para. 104 (b)) for a results-based management framework,  including its five principles, to foster a more results-oriented Secretariat by  integrating and strengthening the cycle of strategic planning, budgeting, monitoring  and evaluation.   55. The Joint Inspection Unit has defined results-based management as ""a  management approach focused on achieving results; a broad management strategy  aimed at the way agencies operate, with improving performance (achieving results)  as the central orientation"".9 As defined by the Office of Internal Oversight Services  (A/63/268, para. 1), results-based management is ""a management strategy by which  the Secretariat ensures that its processes, outputs and services contribute to the  achievement of clearly stated expected accomplishments and objectives. It focuses  on achieving results and improving performance, integrating lessons learned into  management decisions and monitoring of and reporting on performance"". From both  definitions, key concepts for the implementation of results-based management  emerge: formulating objectives and selecting indicators to measure progress towards  these objectives; collecting and analysing data on results to monitor performance;  and integrating evaluations and lessons learned for management decisions. The  General Assembly endorsed the principles of the results-based management  framework I have proposed to establish the practice of results-based management in  the Secretariat. This framework is based on the understanding that results-based  management is a broad management approach that uses information about results  for strategic planning, human resources and budgetary decision-making,  performance measurement and learning (A/62/701 and Corr.1, para. 65).   56. The foundation of results-based management consists of a system of cascading  elements that builds upon the ""assumption of a logical hierarchy or chain of cause- and-effect relationships from inputs through outputs to outcomes"" (A/63/268,   para. 3). To put it simply, in the Secretariat, this chain is broken in several places, a  fact that makes it impossible to advance the results-based management framework  in a coherent and holistic manner and, at the same time, adversely affects the  accountability framework of the Secretariat.   57. There are four critical links in the results-based management framework that  are weak and must be addressed in order to advance implementation of results-based  management in the Secretariat.  58. A first critical link is contained in part one of the strategic framework  document, which defines the objectives of the Organization. During the biennium  __________________    8  JIU/REP/2004/5, JIU/REP/2004/6, JIU/REP/2004/7 and JIU/REP/2004/8, see A/59/617,  A/59/607, A/59/631 and A/59/632.    9  JIU/REP/2004/6, box 1; see A/59/607.    A/64/640   17  10-22371    2006-2007, Member States decided to take no decision on this part and to request  me to prepare and propose a plan outline reflecting the longer-term objectives of the  Organization based on a set of priorities defined by them and taking into  consideration the outcomes of the intergovernmental conferences and summits,  inputs from relevant programme managers, and the use of intergovernmentally  agreed terms and expressions. They approved only part two of the strategic  framework document, the biennial programme plan. A similar situation occurred  during the biennium 2008-2009. Thus, the programme budget had to be developed  in the absence of clearly stated mandated objectives that, under the covenant  between Member States and the Secretariat, the Secretariat should have received.  For the biennium 2010-2011, the Committee for Programme and Coordination, at its  forty-eighth session, recommended that the General Assembly should further review  the plan outline (part one) of the proposed framework for the period 2010-2011, so  that it more accurately reflected the longer-term objectives of the Organization  based on all mandates that had been approved by the Member States. The  Committee also requested me to present future plan outlines (part one) of proposed  strategic frameworks taking fully into account the guidelines provided by the  General Assembly in its resolutions 59/275, 61/235 and 62/224, as well as  subsequent relevant resolutions, so as to ensure that they more accurately captured  the longer-term objectives of the Organization, based on all mandates that had been  approved by the Member States. In resolution 63/247, the Assembly endorsed the  conclusions and recommendations of the Committee for Programme and  Coordination on the proposed biennial programme plan for the period 2010-2011  and approved the priorities for the period 2010-2011 contained in the plan outline. I  request Member States to continue the trend of forging a consensus that allows for  the adoption of the complete strategic framework document for future budget  cycles.   59. A second critical link relates to the logical frameworks for each  subprogramme. These are found in part two of the strategic framework document,  the biennial programme plan, and are also reflected in the programme budget.  Shortcomings of the results-based budgeting logical frameworks include the  following:    (a)  Broad objectives and priorities set at the top of the Organization are not  always linked to those at the lower levels and are sometimes not clearly formulated  or attainable;     (b)  Some  expected  accomplishments  and  associated  indicators  of  achievement are formulated at the level of activities and outputs and do not  necessarily lend themselves to the achievement of established objectives;     (c)  Some performance measures are not appropriately related to their  corresponding indicators of achievement;     (d)  External factors are not based on an appropriate risk assessment.10  __________________    10  Some of these weaknesses have been described in previous reports of the oversight bodies, such  as the Office of Internal Oversight Services review of results-based management at the United Nations,  which concluded that ""Results-based management at the United Nations has been an administrative  chore of little value to accountability and decision-making"" (A/63/268); the Joint Inspection Unit  evaluation of results-based budgeting in peacekeeping operations (JIU/REP/2006/1, see A/60/709); and  the series of Joint Inspection Unit reports referred to above in footnote 4.  A/64/640      10-22371  18    60. The current formulation of the logical frameworks limits the implementation  of an effective accountability system in the Secretariat in several ways:     (a)  The nature of the work of the Secretariat is such that multiple actors and  exogenous factors critically affect the achievement of many outcomes and results.  Greater effort should be made to accurately capture and reflect the unique and  specific contribution of the Secretariat to the achievement of outcomes. While this  problem is inherent in any results-based management methodology, this limitation  could be reduced with well-formulated logical frameworks;    (b)  Results and outcomes are not logically linked with activities and outputs  in performance reporting. This limits the possibility of forging a vision of the  intended effects of the contributions of the activities and outputs at the level of  objectives and expected accomplishments, and of reporting meaningfully on their  actual achievement;     (c)  Indicators of achievement are sometimes not a good reflection of whether  or the extent to which the objectives have been achieved.  61. A third critical link for an effective results-based management framework and  accountability, which has been raised by the oversight bodies in some of the reports  referenced elsewhere in the present report, is the connection between results and  resource allocation. As resources are allocated at the subprogramme level, an effort  will be made in the context of the implementation of Umoja to improve the  relationship between programmatic and financial aspects of programmes and  subprogrammes and the further breakdown of resources to the level of expected  results (see also para. 69 below).  62. A fourth critical link is the ability of the Secretariat to implement self- evaluations and to actively include lessons learned in the programme and planning  process of the Organization. With the introduction of results-based budgeting in the  Secretariat, self-evaluation tools were expected to become a strong instrument to  determine the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impact of programme  delivery.11 In addition to the independent evaluations conducted by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services and the Joint Inspection Unit, in General Assembly  resolution 63/247 Member States called on programme managers to fulfil their  responsibilities with respect to self-evaluation and sought more detailed information  on the outcome of monitoring and evaluation at the departmental and executive  levels, taking into account, in particular, how lessons learned were shared and  applied in planning activities. To date, the capacities dedicated to this important task  are still very limited and additional resources have not been forthcoming. An  evaluation by the Office of Internal Oversight Services on learning lessons  (E/AC.51/2009/5) found that the Secretariat was weak overall in this area and  identified several obstacles to learning lessons effectively. I am encouraged,  however, by the fact that the Assembly has reaffirmed the importance of  strengthening evaluation in the United Nations system (see resolution 63/311) and  requested me to submit, at the sixty-fourth session, a proposal with modalities for  the establishment of an independent, system-wide evaluation mechanism to assess  system-wide efficiency, effectiveness and performance, bearing in mind the  __________________    11  The Joint Inspection Unit noted that ""self-evaluation should constitute the backbone of any  effective evaluation system in order to provide timely analysis of the performance of  projects and programmes"". (JIU/REP/2004/6, para. 68; see A/59/607).    A/64/640   19  10-22371    evaluation functions carried out by respective United Nations organizations, the  Joint Inspection Unit and the United Nations Evaluation Group. I intend to use the  internal discussions that will be generated by the present report to address the issue  of self-evaluation and to propose comprehensive measures to address the  weaknesses of the self-evaluation systems in some areas of the Secretariat guided,  inter alia, by the important advances that have been achieved in this by the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations.12   63. It is my firm belief that substantive progress on the implementation of results- based management in the Secretariat will depend largely on the strength of the four  critical links in the results-based management chain of cause-and-effect  relationships that I have outlined above. I would urge Member States to explore  ways and means to address these issues in a comprehensive manner.   64. With the substantive support and guidance of the Department of Management,  departments and offices throughout the Secretariat are making concerted efforts to  strengthen the quality of their respective results-based management documents. To  further advance this process, a dedicated capacity is needed that can foster a  common understanding of the principles of results-based management and promote  a culture of results. In its resolution 64/243, the General Assembly stressed that  ""improved implementation of results-based budgeting enhances both management  and accountability in the Secretariat"", and encouraged me to continue my efforts in  this regard and requested me to further improve the results-based budgeting  framework. In addition, the Assembly stressed ""the importance of adequate training  to ensure the full implementation of results-based budgeting"". In the light of the  views expressed by Member States and relevant oversight bodies about the  continuing absence of a fully mature results-based management culture, it is my  view that an ad hoc, uncoordinated and inconsistent approach to results-based  management within the Organization and all its varied activities can no longer be  sustained if we are to be a fully results-oriented Organization. The absence of a  dedicated capacity all these years has slowed the process of changing the  management culture. Therefore, I propose to establish a Results Management Unit  in the Department of Management to provide assistance and support to managers  throughout the Secretariat. The Unit would be tasked to:    (a)  Manage, oversee and support the implementation of the results-based  management system within the United Nations, including for peacekeeping  operations and special political missions;    (b)  Support  the  preparation  of  logical  frameworks  in  Secretariat  programmes, including peacekeeping operations and special political missions, to  ensure adequate focus on expected results and effective linkages between objectives,  expected accomplishments and indicators;  __________________    12  The Department of Peacekeeping Operations has created an Evaluation Unit, located within  the Policy, Evaluation and Training Division, which provides services to the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field Support and field missions. This Unit  implements programme evaluations of missions, cross-cutting evaluations of selected  components across missions and impromptu evaluations. The main findings of these  evaluations are incorporated into the policy development, best practices and training  activities that contribute to the institutional strengthening of the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support.  A/64/640      10-22371  20      (c)  Review the monitoring component of the planning cycle, including the  format and content of the programme performance report;    (d)  Coordinate and report on ongoing internal programme performance  monitoring;    (e)  Support and guide the performance by Secretariat programmes of self- evaluations and utilization of lessons learned;    (f)  Update and strengthen results-based management procedures and  guidelines (standards and methodology);     (g)  Develop and maintain an indicator bank;     (h)  Review and modify the formulation and standardization of outputs;     (i)  Support a network of results-based management/results-based budgeting  practitioners across the Secretariat and develop a regular and ongoing exchange of  information materials;     (j)  Provide training and guidance on the results-based management concept,  preparation of the strategic frameworks and budget logical frameworks, programme  performance monitoring, self-evaluation and utilization of lessons learned;     (k)  Review, update and modify the Regulations and Rules Governing  Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of  Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8), as appropriate;     (l)  Ensure linkages among the programme planning, budgeting, monitoring  and evaluation mechanisms and instruments of the Secretariat, including for  peacekeeping operations and special political missions, for the effective  implementation of results-based management within the Organization;     (m) Maintain and upgrade the Integrated Monitoring and Documentation  Information System (IMDIS).  65. I will also ensure that the review of the Regulations and Rules Governing  Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of  Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation, included as one of the  responsibilities of the Results Management Unit, is comprehensive and conducted  with a view towards enabling the full implementation of results-based management  and aimed at enhancing both management and accountability in the Secretariat.        Recommendation      I propose the establishment of a Results Management Unit in the Office of  Programme Planning, Budgets and Accounts of the Department of  Management as detailed in paragraphs 64 and 65 above to provide  support for the effective implementation of the results-based management  methodology throughout the Secretariat. The associated resource  requirements for the Results Management Unit would be presented in due  course as appropriate.        A/64/640   21  10-22371      I. Results-based management information system       66. One of the key features of an effective results-based budgeting system is the  ability to establish a link among objectives, results and resources. I regret to note  that the main information systems currently used in the planning, programming,  monitoring and evaluation cycle of the Organization (IMDIS and the Integrated  Management Information System (IMIS)) do not have such a linkage.   67. IMDIS is an Internet-based system used in the preparation of both the strategic  framework and the programme budget to capture information on programmatic  content. It is also used in monitoring work programme implementation, organizing  and storing data on performance and the preparation of the programme performance  report. IMDIS was not originally intended for this purpose, as it was developed by  the Department for Economic and Social Affairs with a much more limited scope,  namely to assist senior managers in tracking the implementation of programme  outputs and meeting performance reporting requirements of the General Assembly.   68. IMIS is the principal electronic system for the management of human and  financial resources in the United Nations Secretariat. It supports personnel, finance,  payroll, procurement, travel and related administrative functions and is at the core  of many administrative workflows. IMIS does not include information on  programmes and has no link to IMDIS. This fundamental gap in the Organization's  information management system explains why the Secretariat is left grappling for  answers when Member States inquire about the cost entailed in meeting a given  programmatic objective.   69. We need to remedy this situation by introducing a reliable information  management system to support results-based budgeting, and eventually results- based management. Such a system must align resources with objectives and results.  An effective management system that links resources to objectives would also allow  assessment of the performance level of a programme relative to the resources  provided to it. It would facilitate measurement of the effect that resource allocation  changes have on programme performance.   70. In the context of Umoja, I have proposed an integrated management system  that will provide an efficient means for transferring and sharing information across  the many different functions of the Organization. As I stated when I made the  business case for Umoja (see A/64/380), I expect improved transparency and timely  reporting to Member States and senior management on expenditure, commitments  and results to be among the major qualitative benefits of such a single information  repository.         Recommendation      I request Member States to continue supporting the implementation of the  Umoja project, which will link resources to objectives and will also allow  assessment of the performance level of a programme relative to the  resources provided to it.      A/64/640      10-22371  22      J. Enterprise risk management and internal control framework      71. The United Nations faces an increasing level of risk owing to the complexities  of its operations and increased scope of its mandates. Risk management is already  considered at various levels in the United Nations and is embedded in different  processes and operations. Departments and programmes have developed their own  methodologies, however, by adopting one of several different risk management  standards currently available. As a result, the processes currently in place do not  share a consistent methodology for identifying, evaluating, reporting and responding  to risks.   72. Promoting a systematic risk-based approach to management decisions and risk  mitigation is more critical than ever. I believe that the time has come to strengthen  the current approach of the Organization by adopting an integrated enterprise risk  management and internal control framework that will provide a consistent and  comprehensive risk management methodology for the entire Secretariat. Pursuant to  General Assembly resolution 63/276, a road map and implementation plan for the  establishment of such a framework is outlined in annex II. The implementation plan  is expected to be completed in approximately two years.  73. I foresee that this framework would provide the Organization with a more  effective means of addressing both the strategic risks associated with the execution  of the mandates defined in the Charter of the United Nations and the operational  risks that support the achievement of those mandates. Once implemented, the  framework will significantly enhance the governance and management practices of  the Secretariat. It will strengthen the focus on objectives and will increase our  effectiveness to achieve the defined objectives and the mandates given by Member  States.  74. Enterprise risk management is the inherent core responsibility of management.  Under the proposed framework, embedded risk and internal control management  activities will become an integral part of the processes and operations of the entire  Organization. Accountability and performance management will be enhanced  through the definition of clear risk-management roles and responsibilities. The  promotion of a risk-driven culture will be strengthened through a more informed  risk-based decision-making capability. Transparency will be improved within the  Organization and towards Member States, as risks are clearly communicated  internally and externally through formal reporting by management to relevant  stakeholders.   75. The recognition of the responsibility of management for internal controls and  the appropriate management of risk will improve the effectiveness of the controls.  Furthermore, governance and oversight functions will be enhanced as senior  managers and governing bodies will have an increased capability to make informed  decisions regarding risk and reward trade-offs related to existing and new  programmes.  76. According to best practices in both private and public sector global  organizations that have adopted enterprise-wide risk-management frameworks, an  independent enterprise risk management function should be established under the  direction of a Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to the head of the  Organization. According to this vision, a new independent and objective  organizational team should be created to facilitate effective risk-management    A/64/640   23  10-22371    practices. I encourage Member States to keep such a structure under consideration  for the medium term.   77. For the short term, the overall implementation of an effective enterprise risk  management and internal control framework throughout the United Nations  Secretariat would be led by a dedicated enterprise risk management and internal  control function, the Enterprise Risk Management and Control Section, that I  propose to be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for  Management. I wish to emphasize that management will be the owner of risk  management and control activities in the Secretariat. To support management, the  Section would:    (a)  Provide assistance to Secretariat entities implementing risk management  and control procedures;     (b)  Aggregate risk data from the different unit locations;     (c)  Carry out regular monitoring of United Nations Secretariat-wide risks;     (d)  Advance the adoption of consistent methodologies for risk assessment;     (e)  Facilitate the implementation of enhanced control and risk mitigation  measures at the department, office, commission, mission and tribunal levels in  cooperation with dedicated local risk and control focal points.   78. I am convinced that the risk profile of the Organization and the effectiveness  of the designed controls should inform strategic planning and managerial decision- making. Once established and firmly rooted in the Secretariat, an effective  enterprise risk management and control process will become instrumental to  promote a risk-aware culture. It is my profound hope that Member States will use  the risk management information that will become available under the proposed  framework in their strategic planning and resource allocation decision-making.         Recommendations      I recommend that an enterprise risk management and internal control  framework be established in the United Nations Secretariat in accordance  with the proposed road map, with a view to fully integrating the  framework with major managerial processes, such as strategic and  operational planning, operational and financial management and  performance measurement and management.     To that end, I further recommend that a dedicated enterprise risk  management and control function, the Enterprise Risk Management and  Control Section, be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary- General for Management. The associated resource requirements for the  Section would be presented in due course as appropriate.      A/64/640      10-22371  24      K. How the current and proposed accountability mechanisms in the  Secretariat would have addressed the flaws in the management of  the United Nations oil-for-food programme13      79. Although some of the deficiencies in the oil-for-food programme were outside  the control of the United Nations Secretariat, the Independent Inquiry Committee  identified several weaknesses in the administration of the programme, which, if  addressed, could improve the way the Organization conducts business.14 The  present report addresses those weaknesses identified by the Independent Inquiry  Committee that are within the purview of the Secretariat, including inadequate  internal audit coverage, poor implementation of audit recommendations, absence of  an independent audit committee, conflicts of interest, weakened internal control,  inadequate monitoring of programme implementation by agencies, non-conformity  with procurement rules, and narrowly defined external audit scope.   80. I am pleased to report that in recent years, since the Independent Inquiry  Committee reports were issued, many changes have been made to the accountability  system of the United Nations Secretariat that significantly strengthen the  accountability of the Organization and would likely address or even prevent the kind  of flaws found in the oil-for-food programme. These changes include:    (a)  Oversight. The Management Committee was established. Chaired by the  Deputy Secretary-General, its major functions include (i) a quarterly review of the  status of implementation of various accepted recommendations of the oversight  bodies; and (ii) the responsibility to ensure that recommendations of oversight  bodies are effectively fed into the executive management process;    (b)  Internal/external audit. The Independent Audit Advisory Committee  was established with clear reporting obligations (General Assembly resolution  60/248) and terms of reference (resolution 61/275) that include, inter alia, review of  Office of Internal Oversight Services budgets based on a risk-based approach to the  management of oversight functions and provision of advice to the Assembly on risk  management procedures and on possible deficiencies in the internal control  framework of the United Nations. While recognizing the urgent need to substantially  strengthen the oversight and management process, the Assembly, in its resolution  60/1, decided that the expertise, capacity and resources of the Office of Internal  Oversight Services in respect of audit and investigations should be significantly  strengthened and this has been addressed;    (c)  Administration of the programme. The Ethics Office was established  and has developed policies related to potential conflicts of interest, financial  disclosure and whistle blower protection (see ST/SGB/2006/6 and ST/SGB/  2005/21);    (d)  Monitoring programme implementation. This weakness could be  addressed by a robust results-based management framework such as the one I  describe in section H above;  __________________    13  A more detailed assessment, prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/276,  para. 9 (k), is contained in annex III.    14  See Independent Inquiry Committee, interim report, dated 3 February 2005, second interim  report, dated 29 March 2005, third interim report, dated 8 August 2005, and report on the  management of the oil-for-food programme, dated 7 September 2005 (vols. II, III and IV).    A/64/640   25  10-22371      (e)  Procurement process. Within the context of the procurement reform  efforts of the Secretariat, I introduced measures for strengthened internal control  and the promotion of ethics, integrity, fairness and transparency in the procurement  process, including the establishment of an independent mechanism to review  challenges to procurement awards.  81. Furthermore, the enterprise risk management framework proposed in the  present report would help to identify high-risk areas and develop requisite  mitigation strategies.        III. Conclusions      82. Earlier in the present report, I stated that accountability in the United Nations  originates from a covenant between Member States and the Secretariat, as expressed  in the strategic framework, the programme budget and the peacekeeping budgets.  Member States provide the mandates for what the United Nations must achieve in a  given cycle with the resources appropriated. The Secretariat is obliged to deliver the  results established thereby, subject to the availability of resources and constraints  posed by external factors beyond its control.   83. To bring this covenant to life, all stakeholders must do their part. Member  States must provide clear and concise mandates and relevant resources and  recognize the authority of the Secretariat to facilitate mandate implementation. In  turn, it is incumbent upon me, as Chief Administrative Officer of the Organization,  to be responsive to the directives given by Member States and lead the Secretariat in  the implementation of the mandates entrusted to us. The instruments that ensure that  the Organization operates in an accountable manner must continue to mature and  evolve.  84. The Charter of the United Nations sets noble objectives for the Organization.  We must strive for excellence and be fully accountable for our actions as we take  responsibility for these objectives and work towards their implementation. We owe  nothing less to the peoples of the United Nations.        IV. Recommendations      85. To enable more performance-informed decision-making by Member States  regarding programme plans and budgets, I produced as a pilot an interim  programme performance report covering the first year of the biennium 2008- 2009. I propose to supplement the comprehensive biennial programme  performance report with an interim report on the progress made by the  Secretariat towards achievement of expected results at the end of the first year  of each biennium.   86. I request Member States to continue supporting the implementation of the  Umoja (enterprise resource planning) project, which incorporates, inter alia,  the development of interoperable information management tools needed to  effectively support results-based budgeting and eventually results-based  management, linking resources to objectives and allowing assessment of  programme performance relative to resources.   A/64/640      10-22371  26    87.  I encourage Member States to continue supporting the work of the  oversight bodies of the United Nations, as they play an important role in  promoting a culture of compliance and integrity and in deterring  mismanagement in the United Nations.   88. I encourage Member States to continue supporting the work of the  Management Committee in feeding the findings and recommendations of the  oversight bodies into executive management processes, in ensuring the timely  follow-up and implementation of those recommendations and in strengthening  the dialogue with the oversight bodies initiated in 2009.   89. I propose the establishment of a Results Management Unit in the Office of  Programme Planning, Budgets and Accounts of the Department of  Management as detailed in paragraphs 64 and 65 above to provide support for  the effective implementation of the results-based management methodology  throughout the Secretariat. The associated resource requirements for the  Results Management Unit would be presented in due course as appropriate.  90. I recommend that an enterprise risk management and internal control  framework be established in the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with  the proposed road map with a view to fully integrating the framework with  major managerial processes, such as strategic and operational planning,  operational and financial management and performance measurement and  management.   91. To that end, I further recommend that a dedicated enterprise risk  management and control function, the Enterprise Risk Management and  Control Section, be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General  for Management. The associated resource requirements for the Section would  be presented in due course as appropriate.  92. I propose that Member States endorse the components of an  Accountability System for the Secretariat as described in the present report  and the measures for increased accountability described therein.     A/64/640   27  10-22371    Annex I       Components of the accountability system in the   United Nations Secretariat        I. Introduction      1.  The present annex explains the fundamental elements of the United Nations  accountability system, which is composed of six interrelated components:    (a)  Accountability devolved from the Charter of the United Nations;    (b)  The covenant with Member States: the strategic framework, the  programme budget and peacekeeping budgets;    (c)  Delivering results and performance (including a system of rewards and  sanctions);    (d)  Internal systems and controls;    (e)  Ethical standards and integrity;    (f)  Oversight roles and functions.   2.  For each of the six components, where applicable, this annex provides an  overview of the regulations, systems and structures that are in place to ensure the  proper functioning of the Organization. Its purpose is to provide Member States  with the tools that will allow them to effectively oversee and hold the Organization  accountable for the delivery of mandated objectives and results and to serve as a  guide for managers and staff at all levels to enable them to clearly understand the  present elements of the accountability system in the Secretariat.        II. Accountability devolved from the Charter of the   United Nations      3.  The Charter of the United Nations forms the basis of the accountability system  of the Organization. It puts Member States at the centre of the Organization, making  them responsible for giving mandates to the Secretariat through the resolutions and  decisions emanating from their representative organs. The Charter establishes the  Secretary-General as the Chief Administrative Officer of the United Nations (Article  97). The mandates promulgated by the principal organs of the United Nations are  entrusted to him for their implementation (Article 98).  4.  Under this arrangement, an organizational structure emerges with the  following distribution of roles and duties: Member States are responsible for  providing mandates, expressed as directives, priorities and targets, and the  Secretary-General is responsible for implementing these mandates and for reporting  on outcomes and the resources used.  5.  In discharging these responsibilities, the Secretary-General is obliged to reflect  these mandates in the programme and planning documents of the Organization (the  strategic framework, the programme budget and the peacekeeping budgets) and  programme managers and individual staff members -- down the chain of  A/64/640      10-22371  28    responsibility -- are obliged to prepare their respective workplans with the purpose  of achieving the results established therein. During this process, the Secretariat must  continuously monitor performance, adjust implementation where needed, conduct  ongoing evaluations and use evaluation findings for improvement and learning. This  is an enriching process that is designed to achieve the best results for the benefit of  all stakeholders as is illustrated in the flow chart below.        Figure  Programme and planning cycle                                                                                                  6.  At the core of the accountability system in the Secretariat is the covenant or  agreement with Member States expressed in the form of the strategic framework, the  programme budget and peacekeeping budgets, as these documents clearly specify  what results the United Nations must achieve in a given cycle with the resources  appropriated to the Organization by Member States.        III. The covenant with Member States: the strategic framework,  the programme budget and peacekeeping budgets      7.  The strategic framework, the programme budget and peacekeeping budgets  constitute core components of the United Nations Secretariat's accountability  system. These documents of the Secretariat constitute a covenant with Member  States whereby the Secretariat commits, subject to the availability of resources and  barring exogenous impacts, to achieving certain results that have been mandated by  Member States.

A. Strategic framework      8.  Between 1974 and 2006, the medium-term plan was the principal planning  document of the United Nations. The policy orientation and goals established in the  legislative mandates of the intergovernmental organs were translated by the  medium-term plan into programmes and subprogrammes. The medium-term plan  developed for the 1998-2001 period moved towards a results-based approach, as it  focused more on objectives than on activities and outputs, and sought to make a  clearer link between programmes and budget sections by aligning programmes to  major organizational units.  9.  The medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 was the first to reflect the  application of a logical framework, which provided the structure for biennial  programme  budgets.  The  2002-2005  plan  defined  objectives,  expected  accomplishments and indicators of achievement. In its formulation, programme  managers focused on the raison d'etre of their programmes and not just on  deliverables.  10. In 2002, the Secretary-General submitted his report entitled ""Strengthening of  the United Nations: an agenda for further change"" (A/57/387 and Corr.1), in which  he identified a number of weaknesses in the budgeting and planning process. These  weaknesses were addressed in the subsequent report, ""Strengthening of the United  Nations: an agenda for further change -- improvements to the current process of  planning and budgeting"" (A/58/395 and Corr.1). That report proposed a revision of  the medium-term plan, to be renamed ""Part one, biennial programme plan"" and  ""Part two, budget outline"", which would constitute a ""strategic framework"" for the  Organization and cover a two-year period. This proposal was endorsed by the  General Assembly in its resolution 58/269.  11. Following a trial period, the General Assembly decided, by its resolution  62/224, to maintain the strategic framework as the principal policy directive of the  United Nations with effect from the biennium 2010-2011 and to improve the format  of part one of the framework by elaborating on the priorities of the United Nations  in accordance with resolutions 61/235 and 59/275.  12. The strategic framework has now become the basis for programme planning,  budgeting, monitoring and evaluation in the Organization.a Part one is developed  centrally and highlights future challenges of the Organization, an overarching  perspective of world events that require action from the international community,  longer-term objectives to be met collectively by the Organization and Member  States, and the proposals of the Secretary-General on priorities. Part two delineates  the objectives, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement, strategy and  mandates for each subprogramme.      __________________    a  For peacekeeping missions, the basis is formed by the peacekeeping programme budgets.  A/64/640      10-22371  30      B. Programme budget      13. From 1945 to 1974, the United Nations budget was organized by object of  expenditure. The expenditure budgeting methodology had several limitations,  including the difficulty of specifying the cost of programmes and the difficulty for  Member States of knowing what the programmes comprised. Member States  demanded improvements and, as a result, a new programme budgeting methodology  was introduced in the biennium 1974-1975, which used a programmatic rather than  input-output approach. In 1993, the programme budget was modified to place more  focus on the relationships between mandates, programmes and budget sections of  the Secretariat, thus bringing increased accountability to the process.  14. In 1997, the Secretary-General submitted a report entitled ""Renewing the  United Nations: a programme for reform"" (A/51/950 and Corr.1 and Add.1-7), in  which he proposed, inter alia, that Member States should enter into a dialogue with  the aim of shifting the United Nations programme budget from a system of input  accounting to a results-based approach. Under this new system, the General  Assembly would specify the results they expected from the Organization, consistent  with relevant budgetary constraints, and the Secretariat would be responsible for,  and judged by, the extent to which these results were reached. Subsequently, the  Secretary-General submitted a report on results-based budgeting (A/54/456), in  which he sought the endorsement of the General Assembly for a gradual approach to  the introduction of results-based elements in the programme planning, budgeting,  monitoring and evaluation cycle.  15. In its resolution 55/231, the General Assembly endorsed the implementation of  results-based budgeting in the United Nations, emphasizing the need to reflect  mandates, policy objectives, orientation and priorities of the Organization in  programme objectives. Expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement  were to be directly and clearly linked to the objectives of the Organization,  following the logical framework model.  16. In addition, in its resolution 55/231, the General Assembly supported, as a  matter of priority, development of information technology and cost accounting  systems that would meet the requirements of the results-based budgeting  methodology and also essential training programmes for staff to effectively  implement a results-based budgeting system. However, the Organization's capacity  to fully implement results-based budgeting has been limited.      1.  From results-based budgeting to results-based management    17. The concept of results-based management was first introduced to the United  Nations by the Joint Inspection Unit, which included as part of its definition of  results-based management not only the process of planning, programming,  budgeting and evaluation, but also delegation of authority, accountability, staff  performance management and contracts. The Joint Inspection Unit produced a series  of reports on management for resultsb that were presented to the Committee for  Programme and Coordination at its forty-fifth session. In addition, the Secretary- General conducted a study of results-based management, which resulted in proposed  __________________    b  JIU/REP/2004/5, JIU/REP/2004/6, JIU/REP/2004/7 and JIU/REP/2004/8; see A/59/617,  A/59/607, A/59/631 and A/59/632.    A/64/640   31  10-22371    actions for improvement, such as a peer review of the strategic framework and  logical frameworks to ensure improved ownership and better use of the information  on results for management and decision-making (A/62/701 and Corr.1). In that  context, while results-based budgeting had not yet been fully internalized in the  Secretariat and in the absence of a comprehensive set of rules and regulations that  were completely consistent with the results-based budgeting methodology,  implementation of a comprehensive results-based management system represented a  significant challenge.  18. Nevertheless, the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee for  Programme and Coordination at its forty-fifth session were endorsed by the General  Assembly in its resolution 60/257, including the benchmarking framework proposed  by the Joint Inspection Unit as a tool for the Secretary-General and the oversight  bodies to measure progress towards the implementation of results-based  management in the United Nations. Thus, in 2006 results-based management  became a mandate to be implemented by the United Nations Secretariat. In 2009,  the Assembly again affirmed, United Nations resolution 63/276 its intention to see  results-based management implemented within the Secretariat.  19. The specific actions for results-based management implementation include  periodic reviews of the logical frameworks of the strategic framework and the  programme budget to ensure improved linkages between objectives, expected  accomplishments and indicators, as well as ownership and better use of the  information on results by the intergovernmental bodies and senior management.  While the key policies and standards on which to build a more results-oriented  Secretariat already exist, the availability of support, consistent guidance and  procedures, tools and training needs to be increased.        IV. Delivering results and performance      20. The third component of the accountability system entails the obligation to  actually deliver on the results established in the planning documents, subject to  constraints imposed by resource limitations and by the risk elements that are outside  the control of the Organization. Thus, the Secretariat is obliged to pursue agreed  objectives and deliver results, in compliance with established regulations, rules,  policies and procedures.        A. Institutional performance        1.  Programme performance report     21. The Secretariatc reports its performance in the context of the established  objectives of programme budgets to the General Assembly at the end of every  biennium in the form of a programme performance report. The content and  frequency of the programme performance report is governed by the Regulations and  Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the  __________________    c  Peacekeeping missions report separately on their performance and on an annual basis, using the  same guidelines as established in the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning,  the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of  Evaluation.  A/64/640      10-22371  32    Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8).  The programme performance report contains an assessment of progress towards  objectives and expected accomplishments by each programme, as well as  explanations for lack of progress where applicable.  22. Programme managers are accountable for the achievement of objectives and  results and the delivery of outputs. They are also responsible for fairly and  accurately  reporting  on  these  matters.  The  Secretariat  monitors  these  accomplishments and reports to Member States on results achieved through the  Committee for Programme and Coordination. The Office of Internal Oversight  Services conducts ad hoc detailed audits of output delivery and results achieved as  reported by each programme manager.      2.  Self-evaluation and lessons learned    23. The introduction of results-based budgeting in the Secretariat called for the  development of a comprehensive set of performance indicators for all programmes,  including peacekeeping missions, and the improvement of monitoring and  evaluation activities. Self-evaluation has become an instrument for monitoring the  relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impact of programme delivery and, starting  with the biennium 2006-2007, programme managers were required to include in  their budget proposals adequate resources to effectively evaluate their programme  performance (see A/60/312).  24. In its resolution 60/254, the General Assembly stressed the importance of  programme managers conducting objective evaluations of programme performance  and of the Office of Internal Oversight Services validating managers' reports on  programme performance. Subsequently, the Advisory Committee on Administrative  and Budgetary Questions (see A/61/605) concluded, inter alia, that there was merit  in strengthening the capacity for evaluation at the level of programme management  (i.e., self-evaluation). However, to date the capacities dedicated to this important  task are still very limited and the additional resources needed to strengthen  evaluation functions have not been forthcoming.  25. This is, however, not the case in the area of peacekeeping operations, where, in  response to recommendations made by the Office of Internal Oversight Services  (see A/58/746 and A/61/743) and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations' own  assessment, an Evaluation Unit was formed within the Policy, Evaluation and  Training Division of the Department. This Unit provides services to the Department  of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field Support and field missions and  implements programme evaluations of missions, cross-cutting evaluations of  selected components across missions and impromptu evaluations. The main findings  of these evaluations are incorporated into the policy development, best practices and  training activities that contribute to the institutional strengthening of the Department  of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support.        B. Individual performance      26. The critical linkage between institutional accountability and individual  accountability is established through annual performance compacts for senior  managers and performance appraisal documents for staff at all levels below that of  Assistant Secretary-General. The essence of the system is that workplans consistent    A/64/640   33  10-22371    with the approved organizational objectives and results cascade down through the  successive levels of managers and staff.  27. These interlinked and cascading agreements between staff and managers  constitute the fundamental and essential building blocks for holding the  Organization and staff accountable for the achievement of mandated results. It is a  basic tenet of accountability that each manager or staff member must have authority  and control over the resources required to achieve the expected results. Without  such authority and control there can be no true responsibility or accountability.       1.  Compacts with senior officials    28. Performance compacts constitute annual contracts between the Secretary- General and his most senior officials. They integrate into one document the  objectives, expected results and associated performance measures that are specific  to each department under the strategic framework and programme budget. In  addition, the Secretary-General has asked managers to incorporate into their  compacts various managerial targets, such as those related to implementation of the  recommendations of oversight bodies and matters related to financial management.   29. Since 2006, the Secretary-General has signed annual performance compacts  with his most senior officials (those serving at the level of Under-Secretary- General). In 2008, these compacts were extended to senior officials at the Assistant  Secretary-General level, who sign them with their respective Under-Secretaries- General.  30. At the end of each assessment cycle, the Management Performance Board  assesses each senior manager's performance against the targets set in the compact  and the human resources action plan and advises the Secretary-General of its  findings. Based on these findings, the Secretary-General requests senior managers to  submit a detailed action plan to the Board to address weaknesses identified in the  performance assessments. The Department of Field Support is currently engaged in  a review of the implementation of human resources action plans in field operations  to ensure greater accountability by the leadership.  31. The compacts are kept on record in the official status files of senior managers.  An assessment identifying areas of inadequate performance could trigger an  administrative action by the Secretary-General against a senior manager. In addition,  the compacts, as well as the individual performance assessments, are published on  the Secretariat Intranet, adding an increased level of transparency to the Secretariat  that, to the knowledge of the Secretariat, is unprecedented among international  organizations.  32. Senior managers are encouraged to share their compacts with their employees  to ensure that staff at all levels align their annual workplans with managerial  compacts. In so doing, senior managers ensure that achievement of agreed  organizational results cascades down to and is subsequently included in the  workplans of individual staff members.      2.  Performance appraisal system    33. In December 1993, in its resolution 48/218 A, the General Assembly endorsed  the recommendations of the Committee for Programme and Coordination on the  ""establishment of a transparent and effective system of accountability and  A/64/640      10-22371  34    responsibility"" and further specified that such a system should include performance  evaluation for all officials. In response, the Secretariat implemented the  performance appraisal system in April 1996 and introduced an electronic version  that became mandatory on 1 April 2003.  34. The electronic performance appraisal system (e-PAS) is meant to link  programmes mandated by the General Assembly to departmental, divisional,  sectional  and,  finally,  individual  workplans,  constituting  a  fundamental  accountability mechanism within the Organization. The system establishes each  individual's contribution to and accountability for the achievement of agreed results.  The performance appraisal process enables managers to clarify individual goals at  the beginning of the cycle in the workplan, keep performance on track through  ongoing dialogue, and evaluate performance at the end of the cycle.  35. Accountability and individual responsibility consistent with actual authority  over relevant resources are encouraged throughout the process. A wide range of  creative learning and organizational development programmes has been designed to  systematically and progressively build management and leadership capacity in  performance management.  36. Departmental compliance with the performance appraisal system is monitored  through the human resources action plans. Systematic monitoring, reporting and  support have been provided to departments and offices with the goal of increasing  timely compliance with this critical component of the accountability system.       3.  Rewards, remedial actions and sanctions    37. Currently, with the possible exception of the within-grade increment, no  rewards are available for recognition of high-performing staff from an individual  performance management perspective. In respect to remedial actions and sanctions,  they can be applied either in cases of underperformance or deviations from the  principles and values that govern staff conduct and behaviour, which are contained  in the Charter of the United Nations, the standards of conduct for the international  civil service (see ST/SGB/2002/13, annex, sect. V) and the Staff Regulations and  Rules.  38. With reference to remedial actions for unsatisfactory performance, in the first  instance two performance ratings are currently available in the performance  management system to reflect ""partially meets performance expectations"" or ""does  not meet performance expectations"". For the former rating, managers are required to  ensure a comprehensive and detailed performance improvement plan for the staff  member, with regular feedback sessions. Two consecutive annual ratings of  ""partially meets performance expectations"" may lead to the withholding of the  within-grade increment. With reference to the latter rating, consequences may  include withholding a within-grade increment, non-renewal of a fixed-term contract  or termination for unsatisfactory service.  39.  With reference to sanctions for deviations from principles and values that  govern staff conduct, as contained in the Charter of the United Nations, the  standards of conduct for the international civil service and the Staff Regulations and  Rules, administrative inquiries and investigations may be carried out by the  following entities within the Secretariat: heads of office and programme managers;  the Department of Safety and Security; in peacekeeping missions the Special    A/64/640   35  10-22371    Investigations Unit, the United Nations Police component or ad hoc panels and  boards of inquiry; and the Ethics Office. These functions exist in addition to the  primary investigating role assigned to the Office of Internal Oversight Services in  accordance with mandates of the General Assembly. When the deviations do not rise  to the level of misconduct, but rather should be handled administratively, a  performance issue for example, the matter is normally handled by the department or  office concerned with the active support of the Office of Human Resources  Management. When evidence of misconduct is found (i.e., contravention of United  Nations regulations, rules and administrative issuances) following an investigation,  the case is referred to the Office of Human Resources Management to be handled in  accordance with the established procedures for disciplinary matters. Paragraphs 118  to 120 below explain how corrective actions are taken when wrongdoing is reported  by an oversight body.        V. Internal systems and controls      40. The objectives of the United Nations are clearly laid out in Article 1 of the  Charter. In achieving these objectives, staff members are obliged to respect  regulations, rules and policies and to follow processes and procedures, namely a set  of internal systems and controls that guarantee the Organization's correct  functioning.  41. These systems and controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the achievement of the organizational objectives with regard to  operational effectiveness, adequate resource utilization, reliable financial reporting  and compliance with relevant regulations, rules and policies.        A. Regulations, rules and guidelines that establish how actions are to  be taken in the Organization        1.  Staff Regulations and Rules and the Human Resources Handbook    42. There is a well-established hierarchy of norms that govern all issues related to  the staffing of the Secretariat. The legal framework or hierarchy of norms of the  United Nations is composed of the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the administrative issuances, as described below.      (a)  Charter of the United Nations and the Staff Regulations and Rules    43. The Charter of the United Nations is the fundamental source of law in relation  to the staffing of the Organization. The Charter establishes the broad principles  regarding staff and further sets out the role of the Secretary-General in matters  concerning the management and administration of the staff.  44. The Staff Regulations for their part embody the fundamental conditions of  service and the basic rights, duties and obligations of the United Nations Secretariat.  They represent the broad principles of personnel policy for the staffing and  administration of the Secretariat (ST/SGB/2009/6, Scope and purpose). The Staff  Rules, established and amended by the Administration, provide a detailed  elaboration of the Staff Regulations on matters related to staff rights, obligations,  duties and conditions of service. In the hierarchy of legal norms, the Regulations are  A/64/640      10-22371  36    at a higher level; specifically, the Staff Rules and proposed amendments thereto  must be in conformity with the Staff Regulations.  45. In case of conflict, the Staff Regulations prevail, and any provision of the  Rules that violates the Regulations will be disregarded. Further, any amendments  made by the Secretary-General to the Staff Rules are provisional until they have  been reported to the General Assembly, which may direct that the changes be  withdrawn or modified.      (b)  Human Resources Handbook    46. The Human Resources Handbook contains all Staff Regulations and Rules,  Secretary-General's bulletins, administrative instructions and information circulars  related to human resources management, which are cross-referenced to one another  through a system of hyperlinks. The Handbook is maintained electronically by the  Office of Human Resources Management and is posted on the United Nations  website (www.un.org/hr_handbook/English).      2.  Financial Regulations and Rules and the Finance Manual     47. The Financial Regulations and Rules (ST/SGB/2003/7) provide an overarching  single-source document for the financial management policies of the Organization.  These Regulations and Rules are the foundation upon which sound financial  management practices are built. Through the Financial Regulations, the General  Assembly issues the broad legislative directives governing the financial  management of the United Nations. Within the framework of the Regulations, the  Secretary-General formulates and promulgates the Financial Rules. The Rules  define the parameters within which staff must exercise their responsibilities.  48. The Financial Regulations and Rules allow for a systematic delegation of  financial management authority in accordance with the following understanding: the  Secretary-General delegates authority and responsibility for the implementation of  the Financial Regulations and Rules to the Under-Secretary-General for  Management. Authority and responsibility for their implementation is further  delegated by the Under-Secretary-General for Management in an administrative  instruction (ST/AI/2004/1) to the Assistant Secretary-General and Controller and to  the Assistant Secretary-General for Central Support Services.  49. These Financial Regulations and Rules also lay out the responsibility for  management of both expendable and non-expendable property of the Organization.  This involves all systems for receipt, recording, utilization, safekeeping,  maintenance and disposal of assets.  50. All United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the Financial  Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in connection  with them. Any staff member who contravenes the Regulations and Rules or  corresponding administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and  financially liable for his or her actions.        Finance Manual    51. The Finance Manual is used in conjunction with the Regulations and Rules  Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the  Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation and other relevant    A/64/640   37  10-22371    guidelines to ensure proper management of the Organization's financial resources.  The Manual describes all organizational procedures related to finance and budgetary  matters starting with the Charter, authority and responsibility for management, the  budget process, assessed contributions, extrabudgetary and voluntary contributions,  management of cash and investments, accounting and financial reporting,  procurement, audit and ethics.      3.  Procurement Manual    52. The Financial Regulations and Rules also regulate the Organization's  procurement processes.d Additional administrative guidance related to the  procurement function, staff and operations is included in the United Nations  Procurement Manual, which can be found at www.un.org/Depts/ptd/manual.htm.      4.  Administrative issuances    53. Other mechanisms used by the Administration to elaborate internal policies  and procedures and to communicate these to staff are the Secretary-General's  bulletins, administrative instructions and information circulars, in that hierarchical  order. These administrative issuances provide further information on regulations,  rules and policies of the Organization.      5.  Peacekeeping-specific manuals and guidelines    54. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field  Support have issued the following manuals and guidelines as additional internal  controls for peacekeeping missions: Surface Transport Manual: Procedures for the  Field; Aviation Manual; Liquidation Manual; Integrated Mission Planning Process  Guidelines; Property Management Manual for United Nations Peacekeeping  Missions; Contingent-Owned Equipment Manual; and Field Finance Procedure  Guidelines.        B. Organizational systems to ensure the functioning of the  United Nations        1.  Selecting and contracting of personnel      (a)  Staff members    55. Personnel are normally recruited and promoted to United Nations positions  through Galaxy, the Internet-based system that is used to advertise vacancies and  manage recruitment, selection and rostering of candidates. Successful external  candidates of national competitive exams and successful internal candidates of the  highly competitive G-to-P examination process can be recruited directly to base  grade Professional posts (P-2 level). All other recruitment and promotion is done  through the Galaxy system.  56. Recruitment, placement, promotion and mobility of staff are conducted in  accordance with provisions defined in ST/AI/2006/3/Rev.1. Vacancy announcements  are constructed by programme managers and cleared by the Office of Human  Resources Management before being posted on the Galaxy system. Starting on  __________________    d  In particular Regulations 5.12 to 5.14, and Rules 105.13 to 105.19 and 105.22 to 105.23.  A/64/640      10-22371  38    1 April 2010, vacancy announcements will be posted on the new talent management  system, Inspira. Generic job profile templates have been developed to simplify and  ensure consistency in the creation of vacancy announcements for most positions in  the United Nations system. After qualified candidates from the applicant pool have  been properly considered, a shortlist of recommended candidates is sent by the  programme manager to the central review bodies for review. The central review  bodies consider whether the recommended list, referred to as the ""proposal"", has  been developed in accordance with proper procedures and is consistent with  evaluation criteria previously approved by the body concerned. It also monitors  whether geographical and gender criteria have been taken into consideration.  57. Selection decisions are made by the head of department or office after the  central review body has indicated that the evaluation criteria have been properly  applied and procedures properly followed. The selection system is predicated on the  fundamental concept that heads of departments and offices, who are responsible and  accountable for delivering substantive results in their work programmes, must also  be responsible for taking the final decision on the selection of staff that will  implement those work programmes.      (b)  Contractors and consultants    58. Individual contractors are people engaged by the Organization from time to  time under temporary contracts to provide expertise, skills or knowledge for the  performance of a specific task or piece of work against payment of an all-inclusive  fee. A consultant is an individual who is a recognized authority or specialist in a  specific field engaged by the United Nations under temporary contract in an  advisory or consultative capacity to the Secretariat, whose skills or knowledge are  not normally possessed by the regular staff of the Organization and for which there  is no continuing need in the Secretariat. The employment of consultants and  individual contractors is governed by ST/AI/1999/7.  59. In making a selection, the department normally chooses one of at least three  qualified candidates and justifies the proposed selection before a special service  agreement can be processed by the department's executive office. Under  ST/AI/2006/3/Rev.1, section 5.6 (b), neither consultants nor individual contractors  may apply for or be appointed to any post in the Secretariat within six months of the  end of their current service.      2.  Segregation of duties    60. The Secretariat has in place a system of segregation of duties to strengthen  internal controls and reduce the risk of errors and irregularities. Under this system,  no single individual has control over all phases of a decision or transaction that  involves Organizational resources. This reduces the possibility that a single  individual can breach the regulations, rules or procedures causing financial loss to  the Organization.  61. Some of the most important systems for segregating duties in the United  Nations Secretariat are presented below.      A/64/640   39  10-22371      (a)  Central review bodiese    62. In the area of personnel selection, duties are segregated as follows: the head of  department or office is responsible for recruitment, selection and promotion of the  personnel under his or her supervision; and the central review bodies are responsible  for monitoring the integrity of the process that leads to identification and selection  of suitable candidates. This separation of functions is detailed in the preceding  paragraphs, where the roles of the different actors in the recruitment process were  explained.      (b)  Designation process     63. The designation process consists of a clearance procedure, independent from  the selection action, that is designed to ensure that all staff members that perform  significant functions in the management of financial, human or physical resources  have the requisite qualifications and experience to carry out the responsibilities  assigned to them. The designation process effectively establishes a dual  accountability mechanism in the Organization under which staff members  performing administrative functions report to their respective departmental heads,  but are also answerable to the Department of Management regarding compliance  with all relevant regulations, rules and procedures that govern their work. Over the  course of 2009 this process was the subject of a comprehensive assessment, with a  view to introducing a new, streamlined, quicker designation process.      (c)  Separation of certifying and approving functions    64. Under this system, all commitments, obligations and expenditures involving  resources of the Secretariat must be signed by a designated certifying officer.  Following certification, the establishment of obligations, the recording of  expenditures in the accounts and the processing of payments must be signed by a  duly designated approving officer. Both certifying and approving authorities and  responsibilities are assigned on a personal basis and cannot be delegated. A  certifying officer cannot exercise the approving function nor can the approving  officer exercise the certifying function for the same transaction.      (d)  Bank signatories    65. Bank signatories ensure that there are sufficient funds in the bank account  when cheques and other payment instructions are presented for payment, verify that  such payment instructions are properly drawn to the named payee and ensure that  banking instruments are properly safeguarded and destroyed when obsolete. Bank  signatories cannot exercise the approving functions, establishing an effective system  of segregation of duties whereby the staff member that processes or approves a  payment cannot be the same one that signs the checks on behalf of the Organization.  Bank signatory authority is assigned on a personal basis and cannot be delegated.    __________________    e  The Senior Review Group is the standing advisory body constituted to make recommendations  to the Secretary-General on appointments and promotions to posts at the D-2 level  (ST/SGB/2009/2).  A/64/640      10-22371  40      (e)  Requisitioning officer and procurement officer    66. With respect to the procurement process, the requisitioning function is separate  from the procurement function. A requisitioning officer prepares the comprehensive  description of goods or services to be procured and specifies a reasonable time  period within which the work or service is to be performed or delivered. The  requisition is then submitted to the procurement officer, who carries out the  remaining actions required by the procurement process without any intervention  from the requisitioning officer.    (f)  Committees on contracts     67. The most important procurement actions within the United Nations are subject  to a review by an independent committee. In accordance with the Financial  Regulations and Rules, the Under-Secretary-General for Management establishes  review committees at Headquarters and other locations to render written advice on  procurement actions leading to the award or amendment of procurement contracts.  These committees ensure that the proposed procurement actions are based,  inter alia, on fairness, integrity and transparency.       (g)  Property survey boards    68. Property survey boards are established in accordance with the Financial  Regulations and Rules to render written advice to the Under-Secretary-General for  Management in respect of loss, damage or other discrepancies regarding the  property of the United Nations. The property survey boards also determine the  degree of responsibility, if any, attached to any official of the United Nations or  other party for any loss, damage or other discrepancy.   69. Sales of supplies, equipment or other property declared surplus or  unserviceable are subject to the approval of a Property Survey Board (and not to the  decision of a single official within the Organization) and are based on competitive  bidding, unless the relevant Board decides otherwise. The same principle applies to  the disposition or disposal of assets of peacekeeping operations, which are also  governed by these regulations and rules. In this latter case, a report on the final  disposition of assets for each liquidated peacekeeping operation must be submitted  to the General Assembly.      3.  Delegation of authorityf     70. The authority of the Secretary-General comes from the Charter of the United  Nations, which establishes that he or she is the Chief Administrative Officer of the  Organization. Below this, four types of delegation of authority may be found within  the United Nations Secretariat: administrative, substantive, institutional and by  designation.  71. Administrative delegation refers to the authority delegated for the  management of financial resources, physical assets and human resources within the  Secretariat. This authority can be delegated on a personal basis to an individual or  by virtue of the staff member's functions within the Organization.   __________________    f  Important contributions to this analysis have been drawn from the Joint Inspection Unit report  entitled ""Delegation of authority and accountability Part II: series on managing for results in the  United Nations system"" (JIU/REP/2004/7, see A/59/631).    A/64/640   41  10-22371    72. The main source of delegation of authority on financial matters is the Financial  Regulations and Rules (ST/SGB/2003/7) of the United Nations. The Rules establish  that any staff member who contravenes the Financial Regulations and Rules or  corresponding administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and  financially liable for his or her actions (Rule 101.2). Accordingly, financial  management authority in the Secretariat is delegated to a staff member in writing on  a personal basis rather than by virtue of his or her office or functions. In the area of  procurement, authority is also delegated on a personal basis through a personal letter  of delegation of procurement authority; this also occurs in the area of physical  assets management.   73. In the area of human resources, a functional delegation of authority prevails.  The Office of Human Resources Management reviews the capabilities of human  resources officers and provides clearance during the designation process.   74. Substantive delegation refers to the authority delegated to heads of  departments for the implementation of the programme of work of the Secretariat.  This type of delegation is defined in the form of Secretary-General's bulletins,  which describe both the organization and structure of the department or office and  provide a detailed description of the substantive activities for which each  organizational area is responsible.   75. Institutional delegation refers to the extension of administrative authority to  entities away from Headquarters under the supervision of the Department of  Management at Headquarters. This includes the authority delegated to different  departments of the Secretariat, such as the five regional commissions, which have  been granted varying degrees of administrative authority in respect of both financial  (including procurement) and human resources matters. This is also the case with  peacekeeping operations and special missions, as well as with technical cooperation  projects for which varying degrees of authority have been delegated to executing  agencies.   76. Delegation of authority by designation refers to the authority that is  delegated by the Secretary-General, or another senior official of the Organization, to  a committee, task force or working group for the supervision or the implementation  of a task or set of tasks. The most important management-related committees  existing in the Secretariat include the Policy Committee, the Management  Committee, the Senior Management Group, the Management Performance Board  and the Steering Committee on the Implementation of Change Management  Measures  (see  ST/SGB/1997/5,  ST/SGB/2005/13,  ST/SGB/2005/16  and  ST/SGB/2006/14).        C. Guaranteeing fairness in the functioning of the Secretariat's  internal systems and controls        1.  Ombudsman    77. The Office of the Ombudsman was established in 2002 to provide a dedicated  mechanism for United Nations staff, wherever located, to informally resolve  employment-related conflicts in a confidential, impartial and neutral setting  (ST/SGB/2002/12). Where a particular dispute or set of issues reflects a systemic  problem, the Office may make recommendations for changes in policy or practice.  A/64/640      10-22371  42    The Ombudsman reports regularly to the Secretary-General on the activities of the  Office and raises relevant issues with management and staff to facilitate conflict  resolution. The Secretary-General submits an annual report to the General Assembly  on the activities of the Ombudsman.   78. In the recent reform of the system of administration of justice, the General  Assembly created a single integrated and decentralized Office of the Ombudsman  for the United Nations Secretariat, funds and programmes and the Office of the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (resolution 62/228). The new  Office, now known as the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services,  includes a Mediation Division and seven regional branches.      2.  Administration of justice    79. Beginning on 1 July 2009, the United Nations launched a new system of  internal justice. This new independent, professionalized and decentralized system of  internal justice is central to the effort to guarantee fairness and improve  accountability. The reform of the United Nations justice system was based on the  recommendation of an external panel of experts and consultations with staff through  the Staff-Management Coordination Committee. The structure of the new system  has been laid out in three General Assembly resolutions: 61/261, 62/228 and 63/253.   80. The new system consists of two pillars, one informal and one formal. The first  pillar focuses on resolving disputes through informal, that is, non-judicial, means.  The second pillar, the formal system, consists of two levels of independent judicial  review by the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals  Tribunal.       (a)  Informal system    81. Although informal dispute resolution is not new to the United Nations, greater  emphasis and resources are now being dedicated to fostering a culture of informal  settlement. The new focus on informal dispute resolution attempts to solve problems  at an early stage, thus reducing the number of cases going to the formal system. The  United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services, including the Mediation  Division which has mediation resources in many regions, is at the centre of the  informal system. Mediation is an informal and confidential process in which a  trained mediator assists the parties to reach a negotiated settlement of their dispute.   82. Mediation and other forms of informal dispute resolution may be attempted at  any time in the process, even after a case is pending in the formal system. Judges of  the United Nations Dispute Tribunal may, with the agreement of the parties, refer a  case that is pending before the Dispute Tribunal to the Ombudsman for mediation. If  no settlement is reached, the case returns to the formal system for adjudication.  Negotiated settlements, once agreed and finalized, are binding on the parties. A  party can seek enforcement of a mediated settlement through a petition to the  Dispute Tribunal.      (b)  Formal system    83. The formal system represents a significant change from the prior, peer review- based system. In the old system, the Joint Appeals Boards and the Joint Disciplinary  Committees reviewed the facts of a particular case and made recommendations to    A/64/640   43  10-22371    the Secretary-General, who could accept or reject those recommendations. The staff  member could also appeal an unsatisfactory outcome to the United Nations  Administrative Tribunal, which issued a binding decision on the matter. This system  had become unworkable in the context of the much larger, operationally diverse and  decentralized Organization that the United Nations has become.   84. The new system attempts to address these problems through a two-tiered  judicial process in which judgements are rendered by qualified professional judges  assisted by professional legal staff. Professional legal officers represent staff  members in their appeals. Any staff member may appeal an administrative decision,  including the decision to impose a disciplinary measure, in the formal system. The  formal system consists of several components: the Office of the Administration of  Justice; the judiciary of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and United Nations  Appeals Tribunal; the Registries of the Dispute and Appeals Tribunals; and the  Office of Staff Legal Assistance. Each element of the formal system is independent  and professionalized.   85. In the context of the new system of internal justice, the General Assembly  established the Management Evaluation Unit within the Department of  Management. The purpose of the Unit is to evaluate managerial decision-making to  ensure that it is in accordance with the regulations, rules and administrative  issuances and to identify emerging trends and systemic problems so that  management can take swift corrective action.  86. With the establishment of the new system and the expansion of mechanisms to  guarantee fairness in the functioning of its internal systems and controls, the  Secretariat recognizes the need to better inform and educate staff members about the  roles of the different bodies to avoid confusion and the duplication of work by the  different systems and mechanisms.      (i)  The Tribunals    87. The United Nations Dispute Tribunal is a court of first instance, operating on a  full-time basis in Geneva, Nairobi and New York. The Dispute Tribunal is  comprised of five fully independent professional judges, three full-time and two  half-time. Judges are not staff and may not be appointed to any position in the  United Nations following the expiration of their judicial term. Registries established  in Geneva, Nairobi and New York support the Dispute Tribunal. The role of the  Dispute Tribunal is to examine the facts of a case. It may call oral hearings,  normally held in public. The Dispute Tribunal issues binding judgements, although  both staff members and the Secretary-General may appeal, in accordance with the  statute of the United Nations Appeals Tribunal.  88. The United Nations Appeals Tribunal is the second-tier court of review in the  new system. The purpose of this court is to review the judgements of the United  Nations Dispute Tribunal for error, not to hear cases anew. The statute of the  Appeals Tribunal allows this Tribunal to hear appeals from either party when it can  be shown that the Dispute Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, made an error on a  question of law or procedure, or reached a manifestly unreasonable conclusion of  fact. Seven judges make up the Appeals Tribunal. Each has at least 15 years of  judicial experience in a national or international jurisdiction.     A/64/640      10-22371  44      (ii)  Office of Staff Legal Assistance    89. The Office of Staff Legal Assistance represents a substantial improvement in  legal representation for staff seeking to appeal an administrative decision or who are  subject to a disciplinary sanction. The Office has seven full-time legal officers  serving in Addis Ababa, Beirut, Geneva, Nairobi and the New York main office.  While the Office represents a larger commitment to the principle that staff members  should have access to professional legal counsel and representation, it is anticipated  that the volume of requests may exceed office capacity and that some staff will need  to utilize volunteer assistance from serving or former staff members with legal  expertise.      (iii)  Office of the Administration of Justice    90. The wholly independent Office of the Administration of Justice, headed by an  Executive Director, is responsible for coordinating the overall functioning of the  formal system. The Office of Staff Legal Assistance and the Registries of the United  Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal are part of the  Office of the Administration of Justice, which has its headquarters in New York and  a presence, through the Registries and the Office of Staff Legal Assistance, in Addis  Ababa, Beirut, Geneva and Nairobi.      (iv)  Management evaluation    91. The management evaluation phase, a review of contested administrative  decisions conducted by the Management Evaluation Unit in the Department of  Management, is the starting point for any case in the formal system. This review  process allows the Department of Management to evaluate whether a contested  decision has been made in accordance with the regulations, rules or administrative  issuances.   92. If the Management Evaluation Unit determines that an improper decision has  been taken, management will ensure that the decision is changed or an appropriate  remedy provided. This stage allows management to correct itself or provide  acceptable remedies, reducing the number of cases that make their way to the formal  system. The management evaluation also allows management to spot problems of a  systemic nature, take corrective action and enforce accountability.        VI. Ethical standards and integrity      93. A key element of the accountability system is the ethical component --  specifically, the mechanisms, policies, principles and values that set the standard for  the conduct and behaviour of United Nations personnel. The core values and  principles governing staff conduct and behaviour are contained in the Charter of the  United Nations, the standards of conduct for the international civil service (see  ST/SGB/2002/13, annex, sect. V) and the Staff Regulations and Rules.   94. A new system-wide Code of Ethics for United Nations Personnel has been  developed and was submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  (A/64/316, annex). The Code of Ethics is a concise statement that clearly delineates  the fundamental values and principles applicable to the discharge of official United  Nations duties and responsibilities. In addition, there is a code of conduct, the    A/64/640   45  10-22371    standards of conduct for the international civil service, which sets out guiding  principles for staff comportment that is consistent with the status of international  civil servant.         A. Ethics Office       95. Pursuant to the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution  60/1), and in the context of overall management reform initiatives, the independent  Ethics Office was established in January 2006. The Ethics Office develops  standards, training and education programmes and provides confidential advice and  guidance to staff on ethical issues such as conflicts of interest. The Office also  oversees the ethics helpline, has responsibilities related to the protection of staff  against retaliation for reporting misconduct or cooperating with duly authorized  investigations, and administers the United Nations financial disclosure programme.       1.  Promoting ethical standards     96. The Ethics Office, in collaboration with the Office of Human Resources  Management, fosters training on ethics issues to strengthen and raise awareness of  ethics, integrity and accountability. The Office develops, reviews and adapts training  programmes and endeavours to integrate integrity and ethics issues into the broader  range of United Nations training and staff development activities, including  orientation programmes for new staff members.   97. The Ethics Office plays an important role in providing confidential advice and  guidance to individual staff members, staff groups, departments and offices. Staff  members may contact the Ethics Office to discuss actual, apparent or potential  conflicts of interests, such as those pertaining to outside activities, post-employment  restrictions or acceptance of gifts. The Ethics Office does not replace existing  mechanisms for reporting misconduct or for grievance resolution. Rather, it offers  staff members and management opportunities to seek advice, in confidence,  concerning potential ethical issues or conflicts of interest.      2.  Financial disclosure    98. The Ethics Office administers the financial disclosure programme in order to  maintain and enhance public trust in the integrity of the Organization. The primary  purpose of the financial disclosure programme is to ensure that potential conflicts of  interest arising from financial holdings, private affiliations or outside activities of  staff members can be identified, and to provide advice on managing such conflicts,  taking into account the best interest of the United Nations. This could result in staff  members being advised, for example, to take action such as divestiture of certain  holdings or to recuse themselves from a particular activity.   99. The initial financial disclosure programme came into effect on 1 January 1999.  However, the current bulletin on financial disclosure and declaration of interest  statements (ST/SGB/2006/6), which came into force on 1 May 2006, lowered the  monetary reporting thresholds and broadened the reporting requirements in respect  of staff members' spouses and dependent children. It also broadened the scope of the  policy to include all staff members at the D-1/L-6 level and above, staff (regardless  of grade) whose principal duties include procurement or investment functions, staff  with access to confidential procurement or investment information, and staff serving  A/64/640      10-22371  46    in the Ethics Office. Any staff member who fails to comply with filing obligations  under the disclosure programme is to be referred to the Office of Human Resources  Management for possible disciplinary action.   100. Since December 2007, the Secretary-General has encouraged the voluntary  public disclosure of financial disclosure statements by senior United Nations  officials (at the Assistant Secretary-General level and above). The voluntary public  disclosures of the Under-Secretaries-General and Assistant Secretaries-General are  posted on the Secretary-General's website.     3.  Protection from retaliation    101. The policy on protection against retaliation for reporting misconduct and for  cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations entered into force on  1 January 2006 (ST/SGB/2005/21). This policy formalizes protective measures for  staff members under threat of, or experiencing, retaliation for duly reporting  misconduct in their working environment, or for cooperating with duly authorized  audits or investigations. If the Ethics Office finds that there is a credible case of  retaliation or threat of retaliation, it will refer the matter in writing to the Office of  Internal Oversight Services for investigation and immediately notifies the  complainant in writing. All complaints are handled according to specific procedures  ensuring confidentiality and prompt attention.       4.  System-wide coherence in ethics    102. The United Nations Ethics Committee (see ST/SGB/2007/11) was established on  1 December 2007 to establish a unified set of ethical standards and policies for the  Secretariat and for the separately administered organs and programmes. The  Committee consults on important cases and issues having United Nations-wide  implications raised by any Ethics Office or the Chairperson of the Ethics Committee.  103. The United Nations Ethics Committee exchanges information on policy  development and implementation with a view to fostering a coherent approach in the  application of ethical standards and policies in the United Nations. The Committee  pursues efforts to harmonize policies on protection and training, to coordinate  financial disclosure programmes and to review annual reports of member  organizations.         VII. Oversight roles and functions      104. Management is primarily responsible for monitoring internal systems and  controls to ensure that the Organization is able to accomplish its objectives in an  efficient and transparent manner. Oversight bodies have an important role to play in  promoting a culture of compliance and integrity and in deterring mismanagement and  corruption. In the performance of their functions, oversight bodies provide critical  support to management by independently assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of  these internal systems and controls. This section describes the accountability role of  the key oversight bodies of the Secretariat and discusses approaches and measures for  enhancing the timely implementation of oversight body recommendations.         A/64/640   47  10-22371      A. Oversight roles and functions in the United Nations Secretariat in  relation to accountability      105. The oversight functions in the Secretariat are carried out by the Board of  Auditors, the Joint Inspection Unit, the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the  Independent Audit Advisory Committee.g A description of these four bodies follows.    1.  Board of Auditors     106. By its resolution 74 (I) the General Assembly established the Board of  Auditors to audit the accounts of the United Nations and its funds and programmes  and to report its findings and recommendations to the Assembly through the  Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. The core  responsibility of the Board is in relation to financial and compliance auditing. The  Board is required, inter alia, to ascertain whether the financial statements present  fairly the financial position as at the end of the period and the results of operations  for the period then ended; the financial statements were prepared in accordance with  the stated accounting principles; the accounting principles were applied on a basis  consistent with those of the preceding financial period; and transactions were in  accordance with the Financial Regulations and legislative authority.  107. Additionally, the Board of Auditors is authorized under the Financial  Regulations and Rules (ST/SGB/2003/7) to conduct performance audits. In this  regard, the Board may make observations with respect to the efficiency of the  financial procedures, the accounting system, the internal financial controls and,  more generally, the administration and management of the Organization.      2.  Joint Inspection Unit    108. The Joint Inspection Unit of the United Nations system is the only external and  independent system-wide inspection, evaluation and investigation body. It is  responsible to the General Assembly of the United Nations and similarly to the  competent legislative organs of those specialized agencies and other international  organizations within the United Nations system that have accepted its Statute  (General Assembly resolution 31/192, annex).   109. Through inspection and evaluation aimed at improving management and  methods and at achieving greater coordination between organizations, the Joint  Inspection Unit provides an independent view. It proposes reforms and makes  recommendations it deems necessary, issuing reports to the competent organs of the  organizations, with a view to assisting them in meeting their governance  responsibilities, and addressing notes and management letters to the executive  heads. Through its work, the Unit endeavours to help organizations improve  efficiency and effectiveness in achieving their legislative mandates and objectives,  identifies best practices and facilitates information and knowledge-sharing  throughout the system.    __________________    g  The Independent Audit Advisory Committee, as a subsidiary body of the General Assembly,  serves in an expert advisory capacity and assists the Assembly in fulfilling its oversight  responsibilities (see resolution 60/248, sect. XIII).  A/64/640      10-22371  48      3.  Office of Internal Oversight Services     110. The mandate of the Office of Internal Oversight Services is to promote good  governance and accountability in the Organization by providing independent and  objective oversight. The Office was established in July 1994 as an operationally  independent office to assist the Secretary-General in fulfilling his internal oversight  responsibilities in respect of the resources and staff of the Organization through  monitoring, internal audit, inspection, evaluation and investigation. The mandate  has been reviewed every five years as established in General Assembly resolutions  48/218 B, 54/244 and 59/272.   111. The Office of Internal Oversight Services assists the Organization in  protecting its assets and provides assurance that programme activities comply with  all relevant resolutions, regulations, rules and policies of the Organization. The  Office plays an important role in preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse,  malfeasance and mismanagement.       4.  Independent Audit Advisory Committee     112. Following the 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly observed that  additional measures were needed to strengthen the independence of the oversight  structures and requested the Secretary-General to submit detailed proposals at its  sixtieth session on the creation of an independent oversight advisory committee. The  Secretary-General submitted those proposals in November 2005 (see A/60/568 and  Corr.1 and 2). In December 2005, the General Assembly decided (resolution 60/248,  sect. XIII) to establish the Independent Audit Advisory Committee as a new  independent oversight advisory body of the United Nations and as a subsidiary body  to the Assembly.   113. The Independent Audit Advisory Committee serves in an expert advisory  rather than operational capacity and assists the General Assembly in fulfilling its  oversight responsibilities. Specifically, the Committee is responsible for advising  the Assembly on the scope, results and effectiveness of audit and other oversight  functions, especially of the Office of Internal Oversight Services; on measures to  ensure management's compliance with audit and other oversight recommendations;  and on various risk management, internal control, operational, accounting and  disclosure issues. Additionally, the Committee advises the Assembly on measures to  increase and facilitate cooperation among United Nations oversight bodies.        B. Implementation of recommendations and identification of   systemic issues       114. To ensure timely implementation of oversight body recommendations, the  Secretary-General decided to amend the terms of reference of the Management  Committee (see ST/SGB/2005/6) to include as one of the core functions of the  Committee to ""ensure that findings and recommendations of the Board of Auditors,  the Joint Inspection Unit and the Office of Internal Oversight Services are  effectively fed into the executive management processes, and that accepted  recommendations are followed up and implemented in a timely manner"" (see  ST/SGB/2006/14).     A/64/640   49  10-22371    115. The Department of Management monitors departmental implementation of  oversight recommendations and reports the implementation status to the  Management Committee on a quarterly basis. The reports of the oversight bodies are  also fed into the intergovernmental process through the Committee for Programme  and Coordination, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary  Questions and/or the Fifth Committee. This enables Member States to make  informed decisions in regard to the accomplishments of the Organization and its  level of compliance with rules, policies and procedures.  116. The Department of Management seeks to strengthen its monitoring efforts by  gradually developing a capacity to conduct reviews of those systemic issues that  would benefit from systemic solutions. Systemic analysis would go beyond the  piecemeal approach of monitoring implementation of recommendations by  individual departments, providing the basis for comprehensive solutions to  Secretariat-wide problems and weaknesses. It is anticipated that reports identifying  systemic weakness and proposed solutions will be submitted to the Management  Committee on a periodic basis to obtain direction and decision from the Committee  regarding implementation of proposed solutions.  117. The oversight bodies also have an important role to play to ensure the  likelihood of the implementation of recommendations by: issuing recommendations  that include a clear and workable proposal for their implementation; providing  mechanisms that promote action and follow up on oversight recommendations and  foster discipline to pursue full and timely implementation; focusing on critical  issues with substantial impact on functional effectiveness in oversight reports and  avoiding an excessively large number of recommendations that may have a  ""crowding-out effect"" and stretch thin the Secretariat's capacity to respond; and  applying a consistent risk-based approach to oversight which will ensure that high- risk recommendations/areas are given priority.        C. Taking corrective action when wrongdoing is reported by an  oversight body      118. Based on the results of oversight body investigations into alleged misconduct  (i.e., contravention of United Nations regulations, rules and administrative  issuances), the Organization takes appropriate action (disciplinary or administrative)  against staff members. In certain cases where the reported conduct does not rise to  the level of misconduct but rather should be handled administratively, as a  performance issue for example, the matter is normally handled by the department or  office concerned with the active participation of the Office of Human Resources  Management. When evidence of misconduct is found (i.e., contravention of United  Nations regulations, rules and administrative issuances) following an investigation,  the case is referred to the Office of Human Resources Management to be handled in  accordance with the established procedures for disciplinary matters.  119. In those circumstances where there are credible allegations that a crime may  have been committed, cases go through a careful evaluation process from both a  legal and a policy perspective, before appropriate action is proposed to the  Secretary-General for his decision. Such action may include referral of a case to  national authorities of Member States for further investigation and/or legal action.  A/64/640      10-22371  50    Once a decision is taken to refer a case to national authorities, the Office of Legal  Affairs implements the decision accordingly.   120. Details of cases of proven misconduct and/or criminal behaviour are reported  annually to the General Assembly and to all United Nations staff members, in  accordance with General Assembly resolution 59/287.    A/64/640   51  10-22371    Annex II       Enterprise risk management and internal control framework        I. Introduction and definition      1.  Enterprise risk management is defined as a process designed to identify  potential events that may affect the Organization and to manage associated risks in  order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the  Organization's objectives. It is owned and executed by the Organization's senior  leadership and applied in strategy-setting throughout the Organization. An effective  system of internal control is an integral part of enterprise risk management.   2.  The present text proposes the adoption of an enterprise risk management and  control framework that embodies all the most critical features recommended by the  Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission,a the Internal  Control Standards Committee of the International Organization of Supreme Audit  Institutionsb and the Independent Steering Committee for the Comprehensive  Review of Governance and Oversight within the United Nations System  (A/60/883/Add.1 and 2). The main components of the risk management process are:  (a) internal environment; (b) consideration of risks and objectives; (c) event  identification and risk assessment; (d) risk response and control activities;  (e) information and communication; and (f) monitoring and assurance. These  elements are illustrated and described below.     Figure I  Enterprise risk management and internal control framework              3.  To implement the framework and provide an appropriate level of execution  oversight, the present document proposes that a dedicated enterprise risk  management and control function, the Enterprise Risk Management and Control  Section, be established in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for  Management.       __________________    a  ""Enterprise risk management: integrated framework"", Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission (September 2004).    b  ""Guidelines for internal control standards for the public sector"", Internal Control Standards  Committee of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (2004 and 2007).

Enterprise risk management and internal control framework         A. Internal environment      4.  The strong support and commitment of the General Assembly, the Secretary- General and senior management are essential for the establishment of effective risk  and control management processes. While a sustainable framework relies on the full  ownership and accountability of management throughout the Secretariat, it can only  be successfully implemented if it receives endorsement and consistent, visible  support from senior management. Risk and control management must be as well  supported by adequate resources at all levels of the Organization.  5.  As a first step towards the implementation of a comprehensive framework, the  Secretariat should establish an overall enterprise risk management and control  policy that articulates the purpose, governance mechanisms and principles that will  guide the adoption of the framework. The policy should be individually applied to  the different departments according to the level and context of risk and risk  assessment.   6.  The policy development will be guided by the following principles:    (a)  Embedding. Risk management should be explicitly embedded in existing  processes. Appropriate flexibility should be applied in the execution of strategies  and allocation of relevant resources through the proper consideration of the risks  that could affect the achievement of the objectives of each organizational unit and of  the Secretariat at the entity level;    (b)  Consistency. The Organization should adopt, as part of its decision- making process, a consistent method for the identification, assessment, mitigation,  monitoring and communication of risks associated with any of its processes and  functions;    (c)  Integration. The enterprise risk management and internal control  framework should be fully integrated with the major operational processes, such as  strategic planning, operational and financial management, and performance  measurement and management;    (d)  Management ownership. In order to increase accountability, risk owners  and management must have a sound understanding of the risks affecting their  operations and must have sufficient flexibility to determine the appropriate course  of action to manage those risks;    (e)  Risk-aware culture. A risk-focused and results-oriented culture should  be nurtured, moving the Secretariat from the current predominantly risk-averse  culture to a risk-aware culture, where decisions are driven by a systematic  assessment of risks and rewards;    (f)  Communication. Adequate information should be provided at different  levels throughout the Organization, to senior management, the Secretary-General  and the General Assembly. Together with the advice of the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Independent Audit Advisory  Committee, Member States and the Secretary-General will then be in a position to  effectively fulfil their respective governance and oversight responsibilities and to  take decisions on modifications of the internal control system.    A/64/640   53  10-22371      B. Consideration of risks and objectives      7.  The risk assessment process begins with a mapping of risks in relation to  underlying strategies, plans and objectives that will eventually be used to prioritize  risks and determine the required management and mitigation activities. To this end,  the Secretariat defines its risk universe, which includes a high-level description of  all of the risks relevant to the Organization. As a subset of the United Nations  Secretariat risk universe, each department, office, commission, mission and tribunal  develops its own risk catalogue, which should be tailored to reflect the profile of the  organizational unit under consideration. This process facilitates the adoption of a  common risk language that allows the Secretariat to collect and evaluate risk  information on multiple levels across the entire Organization in a consistent and  integrated manner. It also enables senior management to understand the impact of  various alternate response strategies on a system-wide basis, as well as to assess the  overall effectiveness of existing controls and measures of risk mitigation.  8.  The risk universe for the Secretariat developed in 2008 identified a catalogue  of 116 risks in five major risk areas: (a) strategic; (b) governance; (c) operational;  (d) compliance; and (e) financial (see table 1 below).  9.  All relevant risk information related to the risk assessment process needs to be  captured in a central repository, the Secretariat's risk register. It should include the  risk universe (the risk category, risk sub-category, risk and risk definition) and  information regarding rating results, contributing risk factors and drivers. Each unit  location should maintain the relevant subset of risks within the risk register,  reflecting any relevant changes in the risk environment. A comprehensive review  must be completed at least annually in conjunction with periodic risk assessments.  10. Following the definition of the objectives and scope of the risk assessment, the  Secretariat must determine the scoring criteria for the measurement of risks.  According to best practice, risks should be measured in terms of impact, likelihood  and control effectiveness. Impact describes the likely result or effect of an event.  Likelihood ranks the possibility that a given event will occur. Control effectiveness  rates the perceived effectiveness of the controls, processes and activities that are in  place to manage or mitigate a risk. In this context, internal controls are defined as  the processes that are executed by senior management to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the achievement of its set objectives. For United Nations  Secretariat scoring criteria for the measurement of impact, likelihood and level of  control effectiveness, see table 2 below.        C. Event identification and risk assessment       11. Potential events should be identified by collecting information from senior  managers and staff members in the organizational unit that is conducting the risk  assessment. This can be done through individual interviews, workshops, risk  questionnaires and surveys. Risks may also be identified through the review of  relevant other sources, including process flow analyses, audit reports, incident  reports and lessons learned.  12. Each of the identified risks will then be evaluated according to the previously  defined risk and control rating criteria. As a first step, each risk will be scored in  terms of the risk likelihood and impact, based on the information obtained through  A/64/640      10-22371  54    interviews, workshops, surveys or process analyses, without the consideration of  any existing controls established to mitigate the risk (inherent risk rating).  Appropriate input should then be obtained to assess the effectiveness of controls or  processes in place to mitigate the risk. The proper assessment of controls depends  on a thorough understanding of their intended purpose: that is, how they are  expected to reduce the likelihood or impact of a defined risk, and their operational  effectiveness.  13. The consideration of inherent risk exposure on one hand, and the level of control  effectiveness on the other, determines the level of residual risk.c Determinations of  residual risks should be validated in a dedicated workshop so that management can  share a common understanding of the identified risks and their criticality.        D. Risk response and control activities      14. The ratings for impact and likelihood resulting from the assessment of the  identified risks determine the overall inherent risk exposure, and following  consideration of the control measures, the residual risk exposure. The resulting risks  can be classified in three tiers:    (a)  Tier 1. The most significant risks require high-level attention, and as  such will be reported through the Management Committee to the Secretary-General,  and through the Secretary-General to the General Assembly;    (b)  Tier 2. Moderate risks typically require specific remedial or monitoring  measures under the responsibility of the risk owner and the local risk and control  focal point. These risks should be reported to the Enterprise Risk Management and  Control Section and the head of department or office responsible for the area under  assessment;    (c)  Tier 3. Risks that are expected to have a relatively low risk exposure and  a low residual risk should be monitored periodically to obtain assurance as to the  stability of the risk level.   15. The residual risk heat map, a four-quadrant chart depicted below, represents  the results of a risk assessment, and in particular the residual risks as a function of  risk exposure and level of control effectiveness. It can assist management in the  determination of appropriate risk treatment strategies and risk mitigation measures.    __________________    c  According to the definition provided by the framework established by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, residual risk is the risk remaining after  management has taken action to alter the risk's likelihood or impact, and should therefore be the  starting point for determining the appropriate treatment response.    A/64/640   55  10-22371        Figure II   Residual risk heat map                          16. The assessment outputs from the different unit locations should be compared  by the Enterprise Risk Management and Control Section and measured against the  entity-level scoring criteria to provide an entity-level risk assessment result.        E. Information and communication      17. Relevant risk and control information should be provided with the appropriate  level of detail throughout the Organization to support decision-making towards the  achievement of established mandates and objectives. In particular, the risk profile of  the Organization and the effectiveness of the designed controls should drive  management's response plan activities and decisions, and should be considered in  setting the funding and resource allocation requests as part of the strategic  framework and budgeting process. In this manner, an effective enterprise risk  management and control process will become instrumental to the promotion of a  risk-driven culture through a more informed risk-based decision-making capability,  as the significance of risks and the effectiveness of dedicated controls will be  explicitly considered when evaluating programmes and relevant budget allocations.  18. The risks to be covered, the level of detail required and the frequency of  reporting may vary for different audiences and depend on their respective risk  management and oversight responsibilities. Programme managers responsible for  the management of specific risks at the local level should receive detailed  information covering their area of responsibility. Risk and control information  concerning risks deemed to be of the greatest significance should be provided in  summary form and on an entity-wide basis to the Secretary-General through the  Management Committee. The Secretary-General will report enterprise risk  management information to the General Assembly, as appropriate.         F. Monitoring and assurance      19. As the risk assessment process relies on management's perception of control  effectiveness, adequate assurance activities should validate the evaluation and  provide assurance with regard to the effectiveness of designed controls and the    Control  monitoring    Risk  reduction  Risk  monitoring  Risk  optimization or  acceptance High  Low  High  Level of  inherent  risk  Effectiveness of controls  A/64/640      10-22371  56    appropriateness of defined risk treatments. The local risk and control focal points  and the Enterprise Risk Management and Control Section should assist management  with ongoing monitoring and reporting activities in this regard.  20. In accordance with its mandate, the Office of Internal Oversight Services will  be responsible for the independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the control  environment, including the periodic assessment and evaluation of the implementation  of an effective enterprise risk management and control framework. The Internal  Audit Division of the Office will also be responsible for the review of the results of  the risk assessments process, and will consider its outcomes in the context of its  audit planning exercise.  21. As part of its assurance activities on the financial reporting of the  Organization, the Board of Auditors will be able to utilize the results of the risk  assessment as an important element of its evaluation of the Organization's system of  internal controls.  22. Proper risk governance mechanisms are critical for the adoption of an effective  risk management framework. While the day-to-day management of risks and  controls will be the responsibility of all managers and staff members, overall  responsibility for the implementation of the enterprise risk management and internal  control framework in the Secretariat rests ultimately with the Secretary-General. At  the level of each department, office, commission, mission or tribunal, the effective  implementation of risk management and control practices will be the responsibility  of the respective senior official. As part of the existing senior managers' compacts  with the Secretary-General, each senior official should annually confirm, through a  certification report, their responsibilities for the establishment and maintenance of a  strong internal control environment as a result of the risk assessment process. The  General Assembly, with the advice of the Advisory Committee on Administrative  and Budgetary Questions and the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, provides  risk management oversight, ensuring that senior management adopts and maintains  an effective enterprise risk management and internal control framework.d         III. Implementation plan and timelines      23. From start to finish, the initial implementation plan, which will include the  establishment of the necessary human and technological resources, is expected to  take approximately two years. Assuming formal approval by the General Assembly  by December 2011, the initial implementation, comprising four phases, could be  initiated in January 2012 to be completed by December 2013 (see figure III). As the  process of performing risk assessment exercises in selected organizational units will  start according to a phased approach once the Enterprise Risk Management and  Control Section is established, it is estimated that it will take an additional three to  four years to fully implement and adopt the framework across the United Nations  globally, subject to the availability of the necessary resources.    __________________    d  A detailed description of the specific risk governance mechanisms, roles and responsibilities is  contained in a document entitled ""Enterprise risk management and control framework"" to be  submitted to the Independent Audit Advisory Committee in February 2010.

"health and wellbeing","    MSD Public Health Unit - February 2018  United Nations Medical Directors: Recommendations for UN Personnel  Reducing the Risk of Acquiring Lassa Fever in Countries/Areas1 known to be Endemic      * The following occupational health recommendations are provided by the UN Medical Directors to all Organizations and UN personnel to reduce the  risk of UN personnel acquiring Lassa fever in countries/areas1 known to be endemic for the disease.   * These recommendations should be applied to UN personnel travelling to or residing in countries/areas known to be endemic with Lassa fever.   * If this is a hard copy of the document, please be sure to check the https://hr.un.org/page/travel-health-information on the United Nations HR Portal for  the latest version.  * Please contact msdpublichealth@un.org if you have any questions on this document.      References:   *  WHO's Lassa fever webpage   *  WHO's Lassa fever fact sheet      UN Personnel Risk  Categories  UN Medical Directors  Recommendations  1 UN personnel  travelling to or  residing in countries /  areas known to be  endemic for Lassa  fever  *  [Notes on Lassa:  Lassa fever is a viral illness that occurs in West Africa.  The main reservoir of the Lassa virus is a  rodent of the genus Mastomys known as the ""multimammate rat"".  The virus is transmitted to humans mainly  through exposure of food or household items contaminated by infected rats' urine and faeces and by handling  infected Mastomys rats.  The virus also spreads between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine,  faeces, or other bodily secretions of an infected person.  Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community  and health-care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used  needles.  Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported.  80% of people infected will have no or mild  symptoms. 1 in 5 people will develop a severe disease.]            Ensure that you take all measures to protect against transmission of Lassa virus, including:    *  Avoid all contact with rats (dead or alive), their urine, droppings and any soiled objects. Do not pick up any sick or  dead rats.    *  Avoid eating food or drinking water contaminated with the urine and/or faeces of rats.  *  Avoid contact with rodent nests and burrows as these could contain Lassa virus infected rodent urine or faeces.    1 According to WHO, Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria, but probably exists in other  West African countries as well (Reference: WHO fact sheet)  2          MSD Public Health Unit - February 2018      1 UN personnel  travelling to or  residing in countries /  areas known to be  endemic for Lassa  fever (cont.)    *  Remove all sources of attraction for rats including storing food in rodent-proof containers (i.e. lid covered  containers), properly disposing garbage, and keeping your house clean, including washing dishes after eating, to  prevent rodent infestation.  Prevent rats from entering home by blocking holes around house, improving building  materials and structures, and keeping cats and dogs.    *  Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water.  If not available, use an alcohol-based sanitizer.    *  If caring for sick individuals who are suspected or confirmed to have Lassa fever, family members must take great  care to avoid contact with blood and body fluids.  Use gloves and protected gowns to assist sick members who are  vomiting or having diarrhoea.  All soiled clothes should be immersed in a bleach solution (1-part bleach and 10- parts water) for 30 minutes before washing.   *  Always follow safer sex practices.   *  During or after travel to countries/areas known to be endemic for Lassa, you should be alert for symptoms of the  disease, including fever and chills, sore throat, general weakness, headache, fatigue, malaise, muscle pain, chest  pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bleeding.  If you have any suspicion or if you are feeling ill,  seek medical advice immediately and remember to inform your medical practitioner about your recent travel to a  Lassa-affected country/area.     3          MSD Public Health Unit - February 2018      2 UN personnel who  has been exposed to  infected rats or had  close contact with  suspect / confirmed  Lassa fever patients    *  If you have had contact with infected rats or have had close contact (including blood-blood contact, or with  other body fluids) with persons infected with Lassa fever, you should immediately notify and seek advice from your  medical practitioner, UN physician or your Organisation's Medical Services to assess your personal risk and evaluate  the need for any treatment.     *  Persons with such exposure should also be monitored daily for symptoms for 21 days counting from the last day of  exposure.  They should also receive advice about appropriate measures they can take to protect themselves and  their families from Lassa fever.      *  If symptomatic, your doctor may choose to provide you with the antiviral drug ribavirin, which can be effective for  Lassa fever if given early on in the course of clinical illness.                4          MSD Public Health Unit - February 2018      3 UN health care  workers (including  doctors, nurses,  hospital cleaning  staff, lab  workers..etc) in close  contact with or  clinically managing  suspected or  confirmed Lassa  fever patients or their  lab samples    *  All health care workers should always practice universal standard care precautions (see Standard Precautions in  Health Care when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.  This includes hand hygiene,  respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected  materials), safe injection practices and safe burial practices.    *  Health care workers caring for patients with suspect/confirmed Lassa fever should always apply extra infection  control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood, body fluids and contaminated surfaces/materials  such as clothing and bedding (see Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for Care of Patients in Health-Care  Settings, with Focus on Ebola) When in close contact (within 1 metre) of infected patients, health care workers  should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved  gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).    *  Health care workers should maintain a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever in febrile patients returning from West  Africa, especially if they have had exposures to rats in rural areas or visited hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is  known to be endemic.     *  Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately isolate the patient, and  contact local and national disease focal points for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.     *  For laboratory workers, lab specimens may be hazardous and must be handled with extreme care.  Samples taken  from humans and animals for Lassa virus investigation should be handled only by trained staff and processed in a  suitably equipped laboratory under maximum biological containment conditions.    4 Any UN personnel  involved in  environmental and  vector control  *  Assess risk and use appropriate precautionary measures according to national guidance, as Lassa fever can be  acquired from handling infected rodents/rats or their remains.

"health and wellbeing","  Nations Unies    ST/SGB/2003/18   Secretariat      1er decembre 2003          03-63710 (F)    241203    241203  * 0 3 6 3 7 1 0 *     Circulaire du Secretaire general         Politique des services du personnel des Nations Unies  concernant le VIH/sida au Secretariat      1.  L'epidemie mondiale de VIH/sida a fait plus de 3 millions de morts en 2003 et  on estime a 5 millions le nombre de personnes qui ont contracte le virus de  l'immunodeficience humaine (VIH), ce qui porte a 40 millions le nombre des  sideens dans le monde. Il n'existe ni vaccin ni traitement contre cette maladie. Dans  l'exercice de leurs fonctions au service des Nations Unies, les fonctionnaires sont  temoins des ravages causes par cette epidemie, en particulier dans les pays en  developpement, et ont presque tous un ami, un membre de la famille ou un collegue  qui en a souffert.  2.  L'Organisation des Nations Unies se veut une institution ou le fonctionnaire  seropositif ou sideen peut compter a son lieu de travail sur tout le soutien dont il a  besoin. Cela etant, elle cultive la compassion et la comprehension dans un  environnement exempt de discrimination et de peur. C'est pourquoi je tiens a  reaffirmer l'attachement de l'Organisation a la Politique des services du personnel  des Nations Unies concernant le VIH/sida (voir annexe), politique sur laquelle elle  continuera de se guider pour arreter et mettre en oeuvre des programmes concernant  le VIH/sida au lieu de travail. Ces programmes continueront de garantir ce qui suit :    a)  Les fonctionnaires de l'Organisation des Nations Unies et les membres  de leur famille disposeront de renseignements sur les soins et aide necessaires,  comment et ou solliciter des conseils et se faire tester volontairement en toute  confidentialite, se procurer des medicaments antiretroviraux, etc. Les couts de ces  services et medicaments continueront d'etre couverts jusqu'a concurrence du  montant maximal prevu par le plan d'assurance maladie souscrit par le  fonctionnaire;    b)  Les fonctionnaires ne seront pas tenus de subir un test de depistage de  VIH/sida pour pouvoir souscrire un plan d'assurance maladie;    c)  Tout sera fait pour que les fonctionnaires atteints de VIH/sida, ou que  l'on croit l'etre, ne soient victimes ni d'ostracisme ni de discrimination;    d)  Les fonctionnaires de l'Organisation et les membres de leur famille  disposeront de renseignements sur le VIH/sida qui leur permettent de se proteger  contre l'infection a VIH et de faire face au VIH/sida et seront sensibilises a ce fleau;    2  0363710f.doc    ST/SGB/2003/18      e)  Les candidats au recrutement n'auront pas a subir des tests de depistage  de VIH avant leur entree en fonctions, ni les fonctionnaires en activite.  3.  Je vous exhorte tous, cadres, fonctionnaires et collegues, a contribuer  activement a nous permettre de mieux faire face a l'epidemie de VIH/sida, tant au  lieu de travail que dans la vie de tous les jours.    Le Secretaire general  (Signe) Kofi A. Annan      0363710f.doc  3      ST/SGB/2003/18 Annexe       Politique des services du personnel des Nations Unies  concernant le VIH/sida*        A. Renseignements, sensibilisation et mesures  de sante preventive diverses      1.  Les fonctionnaires des Nations Unies et les membres de leur famille doivent  disposer de tous renseignements utiles et a jour pour pouvoir se proteger contre  l'infection a VIH et faire face au VIH/sida. A cette fin, tous les organismes des  Nations Unies sont invites a arreter et mettre en oeuvre un programme dynamique  de sensibilisation du personnel au VIH/sida en s'inspirant du manuel intitule : Le  sida et l'infection a VIH : Information a l'intention des fonctionnaires des Nations  Unies et de leur famille, publie par le Programme des Nations Unies sur le  VIH/sida, et en recensant sur le terrain les services et entites qui, en raison de  l'experience qu'ils ont de la fourniture des conseils sur le VIH/sida, pourront assurer  un suivi en toute confidentialite. Le personnel du Service medical des Nations Unies  doit etre pleinement associe a ces programmes de sensibilisation; il devrait recevoir  toute autre formation professionnelle supplementaire necessaire, et disposer, dans  tous les lieux d'affectation, de tous les documents d'information a jour sur le  VIH/sida, etablis par le Programme des Nations Unies sur le VIH/sida.  2.  Les fonctionnaires de l'Organisation des Nations Unies et leur famille doivent  etre informes des lieux ou ils peuvent obtenir du sang non contamine. A cette fin, le  Groupe de securite transfusionnelle de l'Organisation mondiale de la sante (OMS)  devrait, en cooperation avec le Service medical, etablir et mettre a jour  periodiquement, a l'intention du Siege de l'Organisation, des bureaux regionaux et  differents lieux d'affectation, une liste des centres de transfusion fiables en activite.  Le Service medical et les services medicaux locaux qui y sont relies devraient aussi  veiller a ce qu'il ne soit procede a une transfusion de sang qu'en cas de necessite  absolue.  3.  Les coordonnateurs residents des Nations Unies doivent exercer la  responsabilite qui est la leur d'adopter des mesures propres a reduire le nombre  d'accidents de la route non seulement parce qu'ils sont a l'origine de nombreux  deces et blessures mais aussi parce que ceux-ci representent un risque particulier  d'infection a VIH dans les lieux ou les banques de sang sur font defaut. Les  coordonnateurs residents sont donc invites a envisager de renforcer ou, le cas  echeant, d'adopter les mesures suivantes et de les porter a la connaissance de  l'ensemble du personnel de leur lieu d'affectation, ainsi que des instructions sur  l'usage des moyens de transport en commun :    * Installation et port obligatoire de ceintures de securite dans tous les vehicules  des Nations Unies;    * Formation a la conduite extraroutiere de vehicules a quatre roues motrices;    * Interdiction de prendre le volant d'un vehicule si un chauffeur officiel est        * Renseignements tires de la publication du Programme des Nations Unies sur le VIH/sida  intitulee : Le sida et l'infection a VIH : Information a l'intention des fonctionnaires des Nations  Unies et de leur famille (Geneve, 2000).    4  0363710f.doc    ST/SGB/2003/18    disponible;    * Port obligatoire de casques de protection pour tous les motocyclistes et leurs  passagers;    * Interdiction faite aux chauffeurs d'user de substances intoxicantes;    * Organisation de sessions de formation aux premiers soins;    * Equipement des vehicules des Nations Unies de trousses de premiers secours  contenant des solutions macromoleculaires (succedanes de plasma).  4.  Les fonctionnaires de l'Organisation et leur famille doivent disposer de  piqures et de seringues jetables. Le Service medical devrait fournir des piqures et  des seringues jetables aux fonctionnaires affectes en mission en des lieux ou il n'y a  aucune garantie que celles-ci puissent etre bien sterilisees. Ils doivent porter sur eux  un certificat attestant, dans les six langues officielles de l'ONU, l'usage auquel elles  sont destinees. Les bureaux regionaux et les autres lieux d'affectation devraient  garder en reserve des trousses de materiel d'injections jetable a l'usage des  fonctionnaires de l'ONU et des membres de leur famille. Ces reserves devraient etre  disponibles dans les infirmeries des Nations Unies, la ou il en existe, ou au bureau  de l'OMS dans le pays.  5.  Les fonctionnaires de l'Organisation et leur famille doivent pouvoir se  procurer des condoms aupres des bureaux du Fonds des Nations Unies pour la  population (FNUAP) et/ou de l'OMS la ou on n'en trouve toujours pas de bonne  qualite dans le commerce. On doit pouvoir s'en procurer gratuitement, sans  formalite et en toute discretion.        B. Tests de depistage volontaires, services d'aide psychologique  et confidentialite      6.  Les fonctionnaires de l'Organisation et les membres de leur famille doivent  avoir acces a des tests de depistage volontaires ainsi qu'a des services d'aide  psychologique avant et apres ces tests, et ce en toute confidentialite. Ils doivent  pouvoir beneficier sur place de services adequats et confidentiels de tests de  depistage volontaires et de tests de confirmation ainsi que de services d'aide  psychologique, les organismes des Nations Unies agissant a cette fin en etroite  collaboration avec le Service medical de l'ONU et l'OMS. Les organismes des  Nations Unies devraient arreter des procedures speciales propres a garantir la  confidentialite des resultats, negatifs ou positifs, des tests de depistage du VIH, y  compris le fait de savoir si telle ou telle personne a subi ce test. Seul(e)  l'interesse(e) a le droit de divulguer des renseignements sur son etat serologique vis- a-vis du VIH.        C. Conditions d'emploi et d'exercice des fonctions          Periode prealable au recrutement et possibilites de recrutement    7.  A ce stade, les dispositions suivantes trouvent application :    * Le seul critere medical de recrutement est l'aptitude a exercer les fonctions;    0363710f.doc  5      ST/SGB/2003/18   * L'infection a VIH ne rend pas, en soi, inapte;    * Aucun candidat au recrutement ne subira un test de depistage de VIH;    * Le sida sera traite comme toute autre maladie au moment de l'examen  medical;    * Un test de depistage de VIH pourra etre effectue avec le consentement eclaire  de tout candidat qui presente les signes cliniques du sida;    * Rien dans l'examen prealable au recrutement n'oblige le candidat a declarer  son etat serologique vis-a-vis du VIH;    * S'agissant des affectations dans un pays qui subordonne l'octroi du permis de  residence a un test de depistage du VIH, mention en sera portee dans l'avis de  vacance de poste.

"health and wellbeing","  Psychosocial  Self-Care  UN Secretariat Building, 405 E 42nd Street, New York, NY, 10017 USA  scohq@un.org  UN Staff Counsellor's Office  UN Staff Counsellor's Office  Going on a field assignment can be  both exciting and stressful.     Ebola-related work comes with unique  psychological stressors.  Ebola Response  1 Minute Relaxation: Take a  slow and deep breath.  Place your hand beneath  your navel, feel the rise & fall  of your breathing. Continue  to breathe deeply for 1  minute. Repeat ""I am"" as  you inhale & ""at peace"" as  you exhale. Repeat slowly 2- 3 times.  Do Not Forget:  * Taking care of yourself is as much a  part of your duty as your other official  functions  * Remind yourself that you are  functioning in a new environment and  facing more challenges than usual  * The Staff Counsellor's Office is here to  support you at any time. We can  provide confidential consultations in  person in New York, or phone, or  Skype while you are in the field. You  can reach us at scohq@un.org or       +1 (212) 963-7044  After returning home:  * Expect that you might experience  some re-entry reactions  * Create a buffer zone between the  field and home  * Prepare for ""those"" conversations  with family and friends  * Debrief your experience with a  counselor or people you trust who    will understand  * Get involved and back into ""routine""  * Avoid making big decisions in the  immediate aftermath of returning  home  During your assignment:  * Be proactive in getting what you  need--transform your concerns into  helpful actions  * Stay connected to family and  friends  * Build meaningful relationships with  your new colleagues      Before, During, and   After Your Mission  Before you go:  * Get a UN medical briefing about  Ebola--educate yourself about  the real risks and how they differ  from irrational worries  * Address your own concerns about  Ebola as well as the concerns of  people close to you  During your assignment:  * Avoid denying any feelings of  discomfort and danger that may  arise--take practical actions to  improve your comfort and protect  yourself  * Learn to judge the difference  between rational and irrational  thoughts   * Make time to create your own  space--don't wait for someone to  do it for you  Keep in mind the difference between:  1) The medical reality and realistic  dangers of Ebola  vs.  2) The irrational fear, anxiety, and  other  distress  reactions  that  a  disease like Ebola can ""cause"" in  healthy people  Self-care tips  Learning  to  judge  the  difference  between rational and irrational thoughts  related to Ebola will help you maintain  your health and well-being before, during  and after your mission. Therefore, be sure  to educate yourself about the Ebola Virus  Disease (EVD) before leaving for the field,  and keep yourself updated while you are  there.    While a certain degree of uncertainty and  anxiety is normal, too much worry can  cause problems. Living in a constant state  of alarm can have severe health  consequences over time. Individuals as  well as entire communities can be  susceptible to paranoia about Ebola.  Panic is contagious! Maintaining a level- head is thus a critical responsibility for all  UN staff.  Stick to the  Medical  Protocols  provided by  MSD  Build resilience  by making  connections,  taking helpful  actions, and  keeping things  in perspective  Mantain healthy  habits: get  enough sleep,  eat well and limit  alcohol and  tobacco  Try to nourish  your social  support both at  home and in the  mission  Identify what is  under your  control and what  is not, and try to  focus on the  things you can  control  Take time off  during your  assingment to  help you  maintain your  efficiency and  well-being  Taking care of  yourself--including your  mental health--is a top  priority.  Ebola can have serious  psychological and social effects  even on people who are not  infected with the virus, including  healthy UN employees.      Anxieties about being infected,  lack of cooperation from local  communities, social stigma simply  for being associated with Ebola-- all of these can take a toll on your  well-being.   "

"health and wellbeing","United Nations Medical Services Division  Zika Virus: Health Risk Mitigation Plan for UN Personnel and Dependents  Updated as of 18 February 2016     *  For a list of countries/areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, please refer to https://hr.un.org/page/zika-virus  *  If using a printed copy of this document, you must verify that it is the latest approved copy by checking https://hr.un.org/page/zika- virus      Risk Category  UN Recommendations  1A  Pregnant UN personnel  located outside of affected  areas and who plan to travel  into affected areas    Pregnant UN personnel (in any trimester) who plan to travel into areas where local  transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should be denied medical/travel clearance.      1B  Pregnant UN personnel who  reside within affected areas  Pregnant UN personnel who reside within affected areas should be offered support to  comply with local health authorities' advice and WHO guidelines in order to minimize  risk exposure.  (These may include improving office systems to reduce risks of mosquito  bites, and/or working indoors within the duty station.)          Subject to operational feasibility, flexibility should be provided to pregnant UN  personnel to amend their work, or their place of work, to decrease the risk of  contracting Zika, taking into account local mosquito control efforts and programs.     Subject to operational feasibility, flexibility should be provided to pregnant UN  personnel to allow or provide relocation to a place that is Zika-free.      2A  UN personnel with pregnant  spouse located outside of  affected areas and who plans  to bring spouse to affected  areas    UN personnel should be advised against travelling a pregnant spouse or dependent  from a Zika-free area to duty stations in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is  known to occur.    2B  UN personnel with pregnant  spouse who resides within  affected areas  UN personnel are recommended to relocate a pregnant spouse (and dependents, if  spouse is primary care giver) to a Zika-free area if feasible.        3  Non-pregnant female UN  personnel of childbearing age  who are located outside  affected areas, and who plan  to travel into affected areas    Female UN personnel of childbearing age should obtain individual advice from their  medical practitioner on risk management regarding their plans to travel into areas  where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur.  4  All UN personnel and  dependents  UN personnel and dependents who reside in, or who plan to travel into areas where  local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should be provided with up-to-date  information and advised to exercise the highest level of mosquito bite avoidance and  vector control.  This includes reducing contact between mosquitoes and people by  using insect repellent, clothing, physical barriers, nets, and removal of mosquito  breeding sites.     Due to possible sexual transmission of the virus, UN personnel returning from areas where  local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sexual practices  (including use of condoms during vaginal, anal, or oral sex) or consider abstinence for  at least four weeks after return.      UN personnel who reside in areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur  are recommended to adopt safer sexual practices or abstain from sexual activity.      UN personnel who reside in, or return from areas where local transmission of Zika virus is  known to occur, and who are sexual partners of pregnant women, should use safer  sexual practices or abstain from sexual activity, for the entire duration of pregnancy.      Any UN personnel with lab-confirmed Zika virus infection and their sexual partners  (particularly pregnant women) should consult their primary care provider and/or  obstetrician-gynaecologist for advice.  Such individuals should exercise the highest level  of mosquito bite avoidance for the first week of illness.    These recommendations will be updated as further information becomes available.         "
"health and wellbeing","1      UN Medical Services Division  ZIKA VIRUS: INFORMATION LEAFLET #1 FOR UN PERSONNEL  Updated 24 February 2016  WHAT IS ZIKA?  Zika is a disease caused by the Zika virus that is primarily spread to people through the bite of an infected  Aedes species mosquito. About 1 in 5 people infected with Zika will get sick. For this reason, many people  might not realize they have been infected by the virus. For those who get sick, the most common symptoms  are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for  several days to a week.     For more information, consult WHO/PAHO's comprehensive Zika fact sheets at  http://who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/zika/en/ and  http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9183&Itemid=41711&lang=en     CAN THE VIRUS BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH OTHER MEANS?  In general, Zika virus is transmitted primarily through the Aedes mosquito. However, the virus has also been  isolated in semen and several cases of possible sexual transmission have been described.      Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent mechanism. The usual recommendations for  safe transfusions should be followed.      There is little information on transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Perinatal  transmission has been reported with other vector-borne viruses, such as dengue and chikungunya. Studies  are now being conducted on possible mother-to-child transmission of the virus and its possible effects on the  baby.     WHO IS AT RISK OF BECOMING INFECTED?  Anyone who lives in or travels to an area where Zika virus is found, and who has not already been infected  with Zika virus, can get it primarily through mosquito bites. Once a person has been infected, he or she is  likely to be protected from future infections.    WHAT TREATMENT IS THERE?  Treatment for Zika consists of relieving pain, fever, and any other symptom that inconveniences the patient.  To prevent dehydration, it is recommended to control the fever, rest, and drink plenty of water. There is no  vaccine or specific drug for this virus.            2    WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS OF ZIKA VIRUS DISEASE?    During large outbreaks in French Polynesia and Brazil in 2013 and 2015, respectively, national health  authorities reported potential neurological and autoimmune complications of Zika virus disease. Recently  in Brazil, local health authorities have observed an increase in Guillain-Barre syndrome that coincided with  Zika virus infections in the general public, as well as an increase in babies born with microcephaly in  northeast Brazil.      Agencies investigating the Zika outbreaks are finding an increasing body of evidence about the link  between Zika virus and microcephaly. However, more investigation is needed to better understand the  relationship between microcephaly in babies and the Zika virus. Other potential causes are also being  investigated.    WHAT COUNTRIES HAVE ZIKA?    Specific areas/countries where Zika virus transmission is ongoing are often difficult to determine and are likely  to change over time. If you are travelling, please visit the UN Medical Services Division's (MSD) Zika webpage  at https://hr.un.org/page/zika-virus for the most updated list of countries currently known to have local  transmission of Zika. This information is based on WHO data.  HOW CAN I PREVENT MYSELF FROM GETTING INFECTED?  There is no vaccine to prevent Zika. The best way to prevent diseases spread by mosquitoes is to protect  yourself and your family from mosquito bites. This includes removal of mosquito breeding sites and reducing  contact between mosquitoes and people by using insect repellent, clothing, physical barriers, and mosquito  nets. Please consult MSD's leaflet on mosquito bite avoidance for more information:  https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/ZikaPersonalProtection_UN%20Staff_MSD_2016-02-09_EN_0.pdf.  To prevent potential sexual transmission of Zika virus, sexual partners of pregnant women who live in or have  returned from areas of active Zika transmission are advised to use safer sexual practices or abstain from  sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy. For more detailed information on potential sexual  transmission of Zika virus, please consult WHO's interim guidance at  http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/zika/sexual-transmission-prevention/en/.   CAN I TRAVEL TO ZIKA-AFFECTED AREAS?  As an occupational health service with an obligation to manage occupational exposure to harm for UN  Personnel, MSD advises that pregnant UN Personnel should not undertake duty travel or be relocated to  countries/areas where local transmission of Zika virus is known to occur. Women who are seeking pregnancy  should obtain individual advice from their medical practitioner on risk management regarding their plans to  travel into a Zika-affected area.   All UN Personnel travelling to a Zika-affected area should closely follow MSD's advisory on mosquito bite  avoidance at https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/ZikaPersonalProtection_UN%20Staff_MSD_2016-02- 09_EN_0.pdf.  Additionally, MSD has developed a comprehensive set of recommendations for pregnant and non-pregnant  UN Personnel and dependents who reside in or plan to travel into countries/areas where local transmission of  Zika is known to occur. Please consult the latest version of these recommendations (MSD Risk Mitigation Plan)  on our Zika webpage (https://hr.un.org/page/zika-virus). You should implement the recommendations  according to which risk category you fall under.    3    HOW DO I FIND A LOCAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDER?  If not already done, all UN personnel are advised to be knowledgeable about how to access their local or  UN health care services in case they should become ill with the above symptoms. Staff should research and  ensure that they have all the contact details of such a local or UN healthcare provider handy in the event  they should need this information.   IS ZIKA-RELATED HEALTHCARE COVERED BY MY INSURANCE?    All third party administrators (TPAs) of our insurance plans have confirmed Zika virus testing is covered under  our plans; ultrasound for pregnancies will also be covered.    US-based TPAs (Aetna and Empire BlueCross BlueShield) will cover monthly ultrasounds (throughout the  pregnancy term) for pregnant women who feel they have been exposed to the Zika virus; they will not deny  monthly routine fetal follow-up ultrasound (CPT code 76816).    Cigna International will consider increased ultrasounds medically justified and members will not be denied  this benefit.      I AM PREGNANT IN A ZIKA-AFFECTED AREA AND AM INTERESTED IN RECEIVING MORE  INFORMATION. WHAT SHOULD I DO?  Pregnant women who are located in Zika-affected areas should register for a confidential surveillance  register by emailing msdpublichealth@un.org to receive targeted information and care regarding Zika virus  during pregnancy.  I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ON ZIKA. WHOM DO I CONTACT?  For any other questions related to Zika or this FAQ, please contact msdpublichealth@un.org.  The WHO  website on Zika available at http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en/ should also be freely consulted.    "
"health and wellbeing","UN Medical Services in New York  Configuring your Computer Workstation in 8 Steps    This page contains a practical description of the best way how to configure your computer  workstation yourself.  MSD will ask you to do this before we conduct a site visit.  Please give 2 weeks  for these changes to take effect.  The vast majority of ergonomic issues can be resolved by these  simple steps.  If you still have concerns after following this guidance and making the necessary  changes, then contact MSD by email (msdnurses@un.org) for further assistance.         Objective    Here are a few brief tips on how to sit better at your workspace.     * Position 1 - While sitting in your task chair, please place your feet comfortably on the floor.   * Position 2 - Your ankles, knees and hips should be at 90 degree angles and your thigh bone parallel  with the floor.   * Position 3 - Sit back in the chair and use the back of the chair to support your back. Try to rest your  back bones on top of each other so you sit erect. Your shoulders are relaxed and arms are at your  sides. Elbows are bent at 90 degrees. Hands and wrists are flat and straight in front of you.   * Position 4 - Computer Screen is arms length in front of you, and not too close or too far.     See the picture below for an ideal workstation.        An important general recommendation is ""variety"". Try to take regular micro breaks of 20 seconds in which  you stretch your hands, wrist and fingers. Standing up and walk small distances is already enough to ""reset""  your body. Try not to skip regular break, pauses and lunches. Of course you should spend as few as possible  of your normal breaks at your computer.     After using the positions as described above, you may want to review the next 8 steps to ensure your  optimal position is achieved.     1: Seat Height    Correct posture is often most easily obtained by changing the seat height and levelling your chair to have  your thigh bone parallel to the floor.      Stand in front of the chair, facing the chair, and adjust the height until the seat is just below your kneecaps.  At this height, when you sit down, the angle between your lower legs and your thighs will be roughly 90o.     If you are shorter than 5'-2"", you may require a foot rest which can be obtained from an office stationary  supplier.                       2: Seat Depth     Sit on your chair with your back against the backrest of the seat. The seat depth is correct if you can place a  fist between the edge of the seat and the back of your knee. If there is too much space, your legs will be  incorrectly supported and too little space can restrict the blood supply to your calves. Tilting the seat-pan a  fraction downward helps give your body a slightly more open posture and relieves any pressure under the  thigh.        3: Back Rest     The backrest or lumbar support must be adjusted to provide sufficient support of your lumbar region and  your lumbar vertebrae. This is the part of your back that you can make hollow.  Use the following guideline: The point that supports your back (the curved part of the backrest) should be  approximately 25 cm (10 inches) from the seat. The lumbar support is correctly positioned when you feel no  pressure/support on your hips.           4: Arm Rests    All armrests are in height adjustable, some are also horizontal adjustable. Usage of armrest is helpful to  support your arm-, shoulder- and neck muscles and to avoid resting your wrists and lower arms on the  worktop surface.    If necessary, you can adjust the armrests yourself or ask a colleague to help.  Sit up straight in the chair with  your back against the backrest and place your hands flat on your stomach. Keep your shoulders straight and  relaxed and your upper arms next to your body. The arm rest should now be positioned just under the elbow  giving you light support. Make sure you position both arm rest on the same height. (note: most armrests  have an height indicator by using numbers or stripes).      The United Nations offers the following 2 chairs within the current furniture purchasing programmes.  Both  are able to provide ergonomic comfort for you.  If you have either the adjustable Criterion, or Aeron chair,  please refer to the following links for their user guide to adjust your chair:    Criterion: http://www.steelcase.com/en/products/category/seating/task/criterion/documents/printable%20user%20guide.pdf    Aeron: pl. copy and paste;  http://www.hermanmiller.com/MarketFacingTech/hmc/products/Aeron_Chairs/ADJ_AER_Lever.pdf    Please note that if the Aeron chair is used, you should ensure that you have the correct size by checking this  chart: https://www.hermanmiller.com/content/dam/hermanmiller/documents/product_literature/other/AP_SizeFitRef.pdf    5: The Work Surface     Most work surfaces are built at a height for 95% of the population.  If your work surface is too high, you  may require a foot rest and then raise your desk chair to find the right balance for your reach and eyeline.  If  you are taller than 6'-3"" you may need to contact your Executive Office for assistance.  Sometimes a  keyboard can provide support.     6: Foot Support    Situations may arise in which you are perfectly adjusted for keyboard use, with the monitor at a correct  angle, with your body in an ideal position (with thigh parallel with the floor), but your feet does not rest flat  on the floor.  In such circumstances, you could raise the chair, and you may wish to use a foot support.    A foot support should be adjusted in such a way that your knees make an angle of approximately 90o, or  larger angle.  The foot support should be considered as a replacement / platform for the floor, so try to adjust  the foot support to be as flat as possible. A footrest should support the full feet. A feet relax bar is not a foot  rest. If the angle between the foot support and the floor is too great, this will lead to unnecessary strain on  your ankles and feet. (General tip: do not wear shoes with high heels)        7: The Workstation     The workstation has 2 components, the keyboard and the monitor.   The keyboard must be placed directly  in front of the monitor, on your table top or on a keyboard tray under your table top.  The legs of the  keyboard should not be used in order to prevent extra strain on your wrists. You should position the  keyboard to be in line with the front of the tabletop. Avoid pushing the keyboard away from you and avoid  supporting your wrists or lower arms on the tabletop. Keeping your keyboard close to you will force  yourself to sit up straight.        The height of the monitor should be such that if you look straight ahead, when you are sitting in front of the  monitor, you are looking at the top edge to middle of the monitor screen. If the monitor is too high your  neck will be bent too far back while you work. This will lead to extra strain on your neck and shoulders.    Take lights into account when positioning your monitor. Try to place it in such a way that no light is  reflected on your monitor. Place your monitor perpendicular to the window if direct sunlight interferes with  your viewing abilities.   The best viewing distance for a 15""-17"" monitor is 50-70 centimetres (20-28 inches),  about arms length.    If you use a document holder, ensure it is positioned directly in front of the monitor so that you do not have  to make frequent movements of the head and neck to look from the monitor to a document.  Those awkward  postures can lead to muscle fatigue and discomfort of the head, neck, and shoulders.    8: Mouse    To prevent problems with your hands, wrists, shoulders and back, you should pay attention to a number of  points when working with a mouse.    These points are:  - Hold the mouse close to your keyboard.  - Never use the mouse with a stretched arm.  - Hold your hand so that it is an extension of your lower arm (a neutral, horizontal relaxed position).  - Try to avoid straining the tendons above your wrist. Prevent the tabletop restricting the blood supply  towards your wrists and fingers. This can't happen if you move the    keyboard towards you up to the  edge of the table top.  - Try to use the mouse left and right handed. Switch the Button functions in your Windows settings  via Start/Control Panel/Printers and hardware/Mouse/Tab ""Buttons""; then adjust the buttons to suit.

"human resources","            1        Policy Guideline  Downsizing or restructuring resulting in termination of appointments   OHR/PG/2023/1 - 20 January 2023    Purpose  1. This document outlines the guidance for those involved in the implementation of the administrative  issuance ST/AI/2023/1 titled 'Downsizing or restructuring resulting in termination of appointments',  hereinafter referred to as the 'downsizing AI'.  It provides additional information that may be useful  in implementing the provisions of the AI.  It provides practical advice, information, step-by-step  processes and explanations. It is not intended to promulgate any new rules or policies or to amend,  supersede, or otherwise, in any manner, override the rules and policies of the Organization.  Rules  and policies can be found in the Charter of the United Nations, the staff regulations, rules, and duly  promulgated administrative issuances of the Organization.  Principles  2. When downsizing and restructuring take place, it is important that the policy provisions be applied in  a fair and consistent manner.  The application of the policy should be guided by the following  principles:   a. Minimize impact on staff by ensuring that restructuring targets are not exceeded;   b. Keep the number of terminations to a minimum;  c. Keep lines of communication open between staff, staff representatives and management; and  d. Provide information and career support to affected staff at all stages of the process.  Those involved in the review and decision-making process need to abide with the highest ethical and  professional standards and ensure that all actions are justified and documented.    Scope  3. The downsizing AI establishes the scope of the policy. The following are examples of situations that  may lead to terminations of appointments and would normally be within scope. The list is not              2    exhaustive but provides guidance on determining if a situation may trigger the application of the  policy:  a. Change in mandate likely to require a reduction / restructuring / relocation of posts;   b. Approval or submission of a budget proposal requiring a reduction / restructuring / relocation  / outsourcing of posts;   c. Legislative amendment to a draft or approved budget to require a reduction / relocation of  posts   4. On the issue of restructuring, it should be noted that some entities may undergo post-neutral  restructuring exercises that entail abolition of posts in one geographical location and the creation of  the same or similar posts in another location.  If the abolition of posts in the original location entails  terminating the appointments of any staff members in the entity (including those who are locally  recruited and cannot be moved to the new location), this scenario would be within the scope of  application of the administrative instruction.  Another scenario that would be in scope is when there  is a budget reduction that leads to abolition of posts that were created for projects of a finite duration,  or when a budget cut requires abolition of posts before the expiration date of the appointments of  those encumbering the posts.   5. On the other hand, when the restructuring or reduction of staff can be achieved by other methods  such as normal attrition (separations due to retirements or expiration of appointments) or  reassignment of staff members within the entity, such situations would fall outside the scope of the  downsizing AI.  Heads of entities (HoEs) normally have the authority to reassign staff members  laterally within their respective entities to suitable positions in accordance with their delegated  authority when restructuring or abolition of posts take place.  Note that the normal expiration of  fixed-term appointments following the end of a project of finite duration would also be out of scope.    For these restructuring or downsizing processes outside the downsizing policy, please refer to the  resources section at the end of this document for support and advice   6. When the restructuring involves reclassification of positions or the addition of new functions to  existing positions, a reclassification exercise and the assignment of staff members to these reclassified  positions may need to be conducted in accordance with the administrative instruction on the system  for the classification of posts.    Preliminary assessment by the head of entity  7. As the scope of implementation of the downsizing AI is limited to downsizing or restructuring  situations that may result in terminations of appointments as a result of abolition of posts or reduction  of staff, it is extremely important that HoEs make a preliminary assessment of the circumstances of  their specific downsizing or restructuring situations to determine whether the provisions of the              3    downsizing AI are applicable.  Taking stock of the entity's workforce early on in the process, through  a comprehensive planning that analyzes the priorities of entity and its future needs including  workforce capabilities, ensures that the entity's downsizing is aligned to its business goals. The result  of this analysis will better inform the preliminary assessment.  8. When an entity is required to downsize or restructure, the local human resources or executive office,  in coordination and cooperation with senior management in the entity, reviews both the existing  staffing table and the proposed organizational structure to identify posts (encumbered and vacant)  that will be abolished, created, or reclassified and to make a preliminary assessment of the extent of  the downsizing/restructuring.     9. As indicated earlier, the review of the staffing table may reveal that the downsizing/restructuring may  be accomplished by the application of measures that are within the delegated authority of the HoE.   These measures include but may not be limited to:    a. No retention of staff members beyond mandatory age of separation;  b. Suspension of external recruitment 1  to potentially impacted positions and other  unencumbered suitable positions, except for essential recruitment;  c. No extension, renewal or approval of new secondments and/or temporary assignments except  in areas required to maintain operations and for functions that cannot be carried out by  existing staff members;   d. Achievement of the required budget reduction by implementation of non-staff cost savings (i.e.  cuts in travel or training costs) ; and/or  e. Call for volunteers for an early separation programme.  f. Implementation of an entity-wide freeze on recruitment  processes, especially for new  recruitments except for critical functions which may be deemed as essential to the downsizing  process.  g. The HoE may take these measures to limit the impact of the downsizing on serving staff  members before the formal approval or confirmation of the abolition of posts, reduction of  staff, or the change or termination of existing mandates. The application of mitigation  measures is particularly effective at this stage when the scope of the posts abolished is very  small (for instance, when it affects staff members in the single digits) and the application of  some of these measures (such as the offer of an early separation programme) combined with  some other measures, allows the head of entity to retain the majority of staff without the need  to  go through the whole process laid out in the administrative instruction. The scope of    1 External recruitment is the advertising and filling of positions by candidates not recognized as internal in  the staff selection system.  Suspension of external recruitments can be proposed by the Head of the  downsizing entity for approval by the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance.              4    mitigation measures shall always be applied, at a minimum, to the organizational unit (Unit,  Section, Service, etc.) affected by the downsizing but they may also be proposed for application  to the whole entity in order to maximize the number of potential retentions within the entity.   Mitigation measures may be taken in anticipation of the reduction of staff, including before  budget cuts or staff reductions are officially approved.  10. If, having taken these measures, there are still fewer positions available than staff members or the  HoE anticipates that even with the application of these measures the extent of the downsizing is such  that there will still be fewer positions available than staff members, and thus the termination of  appointments may be required, the head of the downsizing entity has to establish a Staff- Management Group (SMG)  in accordance with the downsizing AI.  Note that HoEs are not required  to implement any measures within their purview before they inform staff of the downsizing and set  up the SMG. The requirement is for HoEs to assess the situation and then inform staff and staff  representatives and convoke the SMG as soon as it is clear that the situation may lead to terminations.    Establishment of the Staff-Management Group  Timing and communication  11. The HoE is obliged to establish the Staff-Management Group (SMG) promptly and without undue  delay.  This entails calling staff representatives for a meeting to inform them of the situation that has  prompted the downsizing/restructuring that may lead to terminations, asking them to nominate  representatives to serve on the SMG and nominating the management representatives. Each side will  nominate their respective representatives to serve on the SMG. Elected staff representatives in the  entity shall put forth their nominees.  Should there be no local staff representative body established  in the entity, staff should reach out to their respective staff union focal points to request help with  the nomination of their representatives, which may include representation from outside the duty  station. Note that the administrative instruction does not prevent management or staff from  nominating representatives from other entities. Both sides must put forth their nominations without  undue delay.    12. While there is no prescriptive rule about the minimum number of members required to represent  each side, ideally the SMG should have no less than two representatives from either side. A gender- balanced and geographically diverse representation is ideal. Representatives should also be given the  necessary release time to discharge their functions to complete the exercise.  13. Given the technical nature of the work to be performed, it is advisable to have human resources  representation on the SMG and management should strive to provide this representation, whenever  possible. When there is no human resources representation on the SMG, management should provide  a focal point for requests of human resources data as needed by the SMG.                5    14.  Since time is of the essence, the HoE should establish the SMG ahead of the formal approval or  confirmation of the abolition of posts, reduction of staff, or the change or termination of existing  mandates in anticipation of the decision(s) that may be taken.    15. Staff representatives may also call on the HoE to urgently establish the Staff-Management Group if  the establishment of the SMG is unnecessarily delayed. HoEs are advised to keep a record of the date  when they inform staff and staff representatives formally that the provisions of the downsizing policy  have been activated as well as the date of the establishment of the SMG and to keep the channels of  communication open with staff and staff representatives at all times.  Transparency and good flow of  information are essential for a successful exercise, and open communication with staff must start  from the beginning of the downsizing/restructuring process and should continue until the conclusion  of the review.    16. A good communication strategy involves:  a. Establishing regular schedules of communication and updates;  b. Sharing the information of the context of the downsizing;  c. Sharing the applicable policy provisions and guidelines that the SMG will use prior to the review  of candidates.  17. Additionally, both HoEs and members of the SMG are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves  with the lessons learnt documents or applicable guidance maintained by the Department of  Operational Support and avail themselves of the operational expertise in downsizing (please refer to  the section on Resources at the end of this document for a list of points of contact).  Mistakes and  litigation can be avoided by reviewing these materials and consulting the expertise of those familiar  with this type of exercise.  Lessons learnt documents can be made available to HoEs and members of  the SMG upon request once members have been duly appointed.    Confidentiality and conflict of interest  18. Because the SMG is responsible for conducting the comparative review and making recommendations  on a number of sensitive issues that will affect staff and involve the safeguarding of personal details  of staff members, members of the SMG must demonstrate the highest standards of conduct.  Before  the SMG members start their work, they should be reminded of the requirement, under staff  regulation 1.2 (m) and staff rule 1.2 (qp), to resolve every conflict of interest in favor of the interests  Organization and maintain confidentiality in the performance of their official duties and to  demonstrate the integrity, independence and impartiality required and expected of them. To this end,  members of the SMG could be required to sign a statement acknowledging their awareness of their  duties under the staff regulations and rules.  SMG members must not disclose information shared  with them in the course of the performance of their functions and must report any real or perceived  conflict of interest arising from their membership in the group.  If it is not possible to identify staff              6    and/or management representatives from the entity, note that the provisions of the downsizing AI do  not preclude nomination of Secretariat staff or management representatives outside the entity.    It is essential that SMG members are free of real or perceived conflicts of interest.  If at any point  after the start of their work, members of the SMG find that they have to participate in the  consideration of cases where a real or perceived conflict of interest may arise, for instance when they  are in a familial relationship with the candidate or any other instance where they would not have or  be perceived to have the required impartiality, in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (m) they shall  disclose this actual or possible conflict to  the HoE, recuse themselves and refrain from reviewing that  case or involving themselves in recommendations that place them in a conflict of interest.  Roles and responsibilities   19. Once the SMG has been established, the HoE will submit to the SMG, as early as possible, information  on the background and context for the downsizing or restructuring (including the expected timeline  for conclusion based on the expected date of formal approval or confirmation of the abolition of posts,  reduction of staff or budget, or the change or termination of existing mandates).  Since each  downsizing situation is unique, the SMG has the flexibility to establish its own work methods and  timelines, in accordance with the timeline set by the HoE for the conclusion of the downsizing or  restructuring exercise. In setting its timeline, the SMG shall take into consideration the potential  requirement to review its decisions pursuant to requests by staff members as set forth in Section 4.12  of the Administrative Instruction.    20. The local human resources or executive office will provide the SMG with the preliminary assessment  of the staffing situation including, at a minimum, information extracted from the staffing tables on  the posts to be abolished or the staffing levels to be reduced, and available positions for placements  and staff affected. When necessary, the local human resources or executive office will also request  the reclassification of positions under the new organizational structure.    21. The HoE shall inform the SMG of any mitigation measures that they have implemented during the  preliminary assessment phase (see above).  22. The first task of the SMG is to establish its schedule , subject to the timeline set by the HoE, to consider  additional or alternative mitigation measures to the measures taken by the HoE and to recommend  such measures, if any, to the HoE.   23. The SMG's recommendation may include the type, scope, order, and timing of mitigation measures.   The main role of the SMG is to provide recommendations to the HoE, and so as much as possible, the  SMG should endeavor to work by consensus at all times.  Disagreements should be documented in  relaying recommendations to the HoE.  24. Concurrently, the HoE shall set up an entity-wide communication strategy as soon as the SMG is  constituted to cover all stages of the downsizing exercise and to keep staff informed about  developments. As part of the communication campaign, and in order to maximize chances of              7    placement outside the entity, all staff members shall be advised to apply, in Inspira, for vacant  positions in other entities in accordance with the staff selection system.  Staff members should be  reminded of the fact that priority consideration for positions outside the entity, however, may only  be granted for positions applied after the termination notice is given and the staff member has been  identified as a ""downsized candidate"". Additionally, priority consideration will also be given to  applications that the downsized staff member may have submitted before the date of notification of  termination, provided that the deadline for applying for the job opening or temporary job opening  has not expired by the date on which the one or three-month period of priority consideration begins.  25. The HoE will also request that the Staff Counsellor and other relevant offices such as the Office of the  United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services be available during the downsizing exercise to  provide support to staff.    26. The HoE will provide the necessary human resources capacity to carry out the downsizing exercise,  including the conduct of reviews, the provision of local human resources or executive office personnel   to advise  staff members on available options, and the provision of training and/or career support  programmes to staff. This is intended to prepare staff for career opportunities within and outside the  entity.  Comparative review   27. If termination of appointments is still anticipated despite the application of mitigation measures, the  SMG will conduct a comparative review in accordance with the provisions of the downsizing AI. Staff  members who have taken agreed termination as part of the mitigation measures will not be included  in the comparative review and will be separated.  28. The conditions under which the comparative review will be carried out are set out in the downsizing  AI. In order to increase transparency, it is worthwhile to emphasize the timelines, conditions and  criteria to staff prior to the start of the review.    29.   Performance evaluation is an integral part of the comparative review. Some staff members may not  have performance evaluations for the last five years prior to the start date of the review, however.  In  these situations, the HoE should instruct all supervisors to ensure that any pending/overdue  performance documents involving staff under their supervision are completed prior to the start of the  composition of the SMG. This would ensure that staff members have all their performance documents  available for review. Only performance documents finalized prior to the start of the comparative  review should be considered.  In the event of missing performance evaluations,  staff members could  be assigned to retention group 1, but would not be awarded points unless there is a performance  evaluation document indicating that the performance exceeds expectations. Performance evaluations  below meeting expectations should always be submitted in the form of a performance evaluation  report.   Information on the manner in which performance evaluation is incorporated into the  comparative review should be communicated to all staff prior to the start of the review.              8    30. In case of appeals or litigation, the SMG is likely to be asked to provide documentation on the  recommendations made on the order of retention, so it is important that all decisions taken on the  ranking of candidates are properly documented and aligned with the criteria previously  communicated to staff and the policy provisions.    31. To ensure transparency in the comparative review process and to facilitate the review, the SMG may  request staff members to provide additional or a full list of required information at the outset of the  review.  A template for this purpose is provided in Annex I. The use of this form is at the discretion of  the SMG.  The template is only provided for guidance and may be altered or not used at all.    32. In the case of transferred staff members under the Inter-Organization Agreement concerning Transfer,  Secondment or Loan of Staff among the Organizations applying the UN Common System of Salaries  and Allowances the SMG, the human resources office of the downsizing entity may also need to reach  out to the organization where the staff member served previously to confirm some of the information  of the staff member.  This may include, but will not be limited to, confirmation on performance ratings,  absence of disciplinary measures or continuity of service.    33. Staff members on special leave, including special leave without pay, are considered to be in active  service so if they are affected by the downsizing or restructuring, they will be reviewed alongside  other staff members at the time of the comparative review.  34. At the conclusion of the review, the SMG will inform staff members of their placement in a retention  subgroup, and if applicable, their rank and score within the retention subgroup.  When informing staff  of their placement, the SMG must indicate the deadline by which staff members may seek a second  review, if necessary.  Staff members should be advised, by the SMG, to submit any supporting  documentation they may deem necessary to substantiate their request for a second review to the  SMG.    35. The SMG will make the final determination of the placement in the retention subgroup and ranking  score, if applicable, and submit it to the HoE.     Retention by reassignment to positions within the downsizing entities   36. The local human resources or executive office, in consultation with the managers, as needed, will  make recommendations to the HoE on the reassignment of staff members to positions in the  downsizing entity.  The recommendation will be based on the order of retention determined by the  SMG and the determination of suitability of staff members to positions within the downsizing entity,  after consideration of the staff member's complete PHP.  If a staff member is not found to be  suitable  for any available positions at a given category and level, the staff member with the next highest score  in the retention group will be considered. If a staff member is deemed to be not suitable for a position,  a record should be kept detailing that assessment in terms of that staff member's profile in the PHP  against the requirements of the position. Note that the downsizing policy allows for reassignment  of  candidates on positions in their category at one level below their original level only once it has been              9    determined that there are no positions for which they are suitable at their original category and level  and after the affected staff member has expressed an interest in being reassigned to a position one  level below their original level.  For reassignments within the entity, there is no need to have roster  membership in the category at the lower level in order to be considered for positions at the lower  level.    37. The local human resources or executive office may take into consideration the staff member's  preference and interest as well as organizational priorities in making reassignment recommendations  to the HoE. In the interest of business continuity, HoEs should attempt, when possible, to reassign  staff members to positions in the same organizational unit (Division, Section, Unit) where they were  working prior to the downsizing exercise provided that they continue to meet the educational,  experience, skills and language requirements of the position.       38. The HoE, through the local or human resources or executive office, shall inform retained staff  members of the positions to which they have been reassigned and will also inform the SMG of the  staff members who have been retained in the entity.  All other staff will be given termination notices  or given notice that their appointments would not be extended beyond the expected expiration of  appointment if the separation date coincides with their appointment expiration date2.    39. In the event that a retained staff member separates from the downsizing entity after being reassigned  to a position in  the downsizing entity, the position vacated by the separating staff member may be  used to reassign a candidate who was proposed for termination or separation  in accordance with the  ranking order of the comparative review, and provided the candidate is suitable for the position and  the staff member is still an active staff member.   Selections outside the downsizing entity  40. Staff members in retention group 1 who hold appointments without limitation who are given notice  of termination (""downsized staff members""), will also be informed that, for a period of time from the  date of their termination notice , they will be considered on a priority basis before any other  candidates when they apply for job openings3 and temporary job openings at their category and level,  or one level below, in other entities.  Priority consideration will not be given when candidates apply  for positions at a higher level within the same category or at any level across categories. Neither will  priority consideration be given to those who separated upon appointment expiration.  41. This policy gives a one-month window for priority consideration for staff members with fixed-term  appointments and a three-month period for staff members with permanent or continuing  appointments, unless the downsized staff member is selected during this time for a temporary    2 As of the date of publication of this document, entities are reminded that there is no sub delegation for terminations of  appointment under Staff Rule 9.6 (c) below the head of entity.  3 A job opening will be any vacancy announcement published to fill positions that are immediately available for a period of  one year or longer.  This excludes generic job openings whose purpose is to create roster membership and are not  published to fill immediate vacancies.  No priority consideration will be given to applications to generic job openings.               10    assignment, in which case the priority consideration will extend throughout the period of the  temporary assignment.  At the time of the release on temporary assignment, the downsizing entity  will be responsible for adjusting the original termination notice as applicable.  The downsizing entity  will also ensure that any extensions of fixed-term appointment that need to be processed do not  exceed the end date of the temporary assignment. Downsized staff members will be reminded in their  termination letter of the requirement to apply for positions if they want to be considered on a priority  basis and of the period of time during which they will be considered on a priority basis.  The following  procedures will be used for consideration of these staff members for available positions outside the  affected entity:  a. Upon receipt of the written notice of termination of appointment, the downsizing indicator  will be enabled in Inspira.  The downsizing indicator will be made visible via Inspira to hiring  managers and recruiters for staff members' job applications to new job openings or temporary  job openings that are still open between the date of the written notice of termination and one  or three months from that date, depending on the staff member's appointment type.   Additionally, the flag will also appear on applications that the downsized staff member may  have submitted before the date of notification of termination, provided that the deadline for  applying for the job opening or temporary job opening has not expired by the date on which  the one or three-month period of priority consideration begins.     b. The activation of the downsizing indicator will denote that the downsized staff members fall in  the retention group 1 for possible selection outside the entity and must be given preferential  consideration for job openings and temporary job openings.  This means that hiring managers  must first review all applicants for whom the downsizing indicator has been activated.  Only if  there are no suitable downsized staff members for a given job opening or temporary job  opening can other applicants be considered.   c. The suitability of downsized staff members who have applied to job openings or temporary job  openings outside the downsizing entity has to be determined and documented. Hiring  managers may either conduct desk reviews or non-competitive assessments to determine  whether downsized staff members are suitable for the job opening or temporary job opening.   Note that if hiring managers decide to use assessments, they must first establish evaluation  criteria required to determine what constitutes a pass or fail result.  Any downsized staff  member that passes the assessment will be deemed suitable.      d. If only one downsized staff member is deemed suitable, HoEs shall select this applicant.    e. If there are two or more suitable downsized  staff members, then the head of entity shall, in  accordance with staff rule 9.6 and 13.2, select first any such staff member holding a permanent  appointment, followed by such staff member who has a continuing appointment, then by such  staff member who has been recruited through competitive examinations for a career  appointment serving on a two-year fixed-term appointment and then to such staff member  holding a fixed term appointment.  When there is more than one suitable downsized staff member with the same appointment  type, the head of entity shall, in accordance with staff rule 9.6 (e), make the selection for the              11    position with due regard being given in all cases to relative competence, integrity and length  of service.  When the position is subject to the principle of geographical distribution, due  regard shall also be given to nationality in the case of downsized staff members with less than  five years of service and in the case of downsized staff members who have changed their  nationality within the preceding five years.  HoEs must show how these criteria have been used  to make the final selection decision in the documentation of the review but note that there is  no requirement that relative competence between the suitable downsized staff members with  the same appointment be determined in the same manner as it was for the purposes of  comparative review.  f. When a downsized staff member is selected for a job opening, the downsizing indicator will be  removed from the remaining applications submitted by that staff member and the termination  notice will be rescinded by the head of the downsizing entity.  g. If the downsized staff member is selected for a temporary job opening, the downsized staff  member will be released to the entity that issued the temporary job opening.  If the staff  member is not selected for a job opening or another temporary job opening during the period  of temporary assignment, and the staff member's appointment continues beyond the period  of the temporary assignment, the staff member's appointment will be terminated under staff  rule 9.6 (e) or 13.2 at the end of the temporary assignment upon return to the parent entity.  However, if the temporary assignment extends until or beyond the expiration date of the staff  member's appointment, which was to be terminated, the termination notice will be withdrawn.  The appointment will be extended through the duration of the temporary assignment, if  applicable, and upon return to the downsizing entity at the end of the temporary assignment,  the staff member will be issued a notice of non-renewal and be separated from service.   h. Downsized staff members selected for temporary job openings will be given priority  consideration for the entire duration of their temporary assignment.     42. If there are no suitable downsized staff members for a job opening or temporary job opening, the  hiring manager will review the rest of the applicants.  Note that no roster selection may be made in  the case of job openings before it is ascertained that there are no downsized staff members eligible  for priority consideration.  In addition, hiring managers will be required to explain the reasons why any downsized staff members  who applied to the job opening or temporary job opening do not meet the requirements of the  position.  Since HoEs are ultimately accountable for all selection decisions, hiring managers must  include details on the review process of downsized staff members in the transmittal memo to the HoE.     Once the HoE acknowledges the proposed course of action/selection decision, all downsized staff  members will be notified of the outcome.  If a HoE selects a downsized staff member for a job opening,  the selection can be made without reference to a central review body, regardless of the roster status  of the candidate. Job openings and temporary job openings will be closed whenever a downsized staff  member is selected.  Upon selection for a job opening, the downsizing indicator will be removed in              12    Inspira from any applications that the staff member may have submitted during the period of priority  consideration.  Note also that downsized staff members who are selected for positions outside the  entity will not acquire roster membership against the position they have been selected for by virtue  of their selection outside the entity.        Conclusion of the downsizing exercise  43. Downsized staff members who have not been retained in the downsizing entity or selected for any  positions outside the entity will be terminated at the end of their notice period.  The HoE of the  downsizing entity will inform the SMG of the number of downsized staff members that have found  new appointments under the provisions for retention outside the entity under the downsizing AI at  the end of the notice period given on the termination letters of staff members who could not be  retained in the entity.   44. When the HoE has informed the SMG that all affected staff members in the downsizing entity have  either been retained, separated from service or had their appointment terminated, the SMG will  provide a written report on lessons learned to the HoE and to the Under-Secretaries-General of the  Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the Department of Operational  Support. The HoE shall then dissolve the SMG. The compendium of lessons learnt from prior exercises  will be maintained by the Department of Operational Support and will be available to any members  of future SMGs.    Resources  45. The Department of Operational Support offers the following services:  a. The Division of Special Activities (DSA) in the Department of Operational support oversees a  range of specialized or cross-cutting operational capacities. The Client Support and Special  Situations Section (CSSSS) in the Division supports special situation operational requirements,  including transitions, restructurings and liquidation and can be approached for operational  support and guidance in downsizing situations as well as for a copy of lessons learnt from prior  downsizing exercises.    b. The Human Resources Services Division (HRSD) serves as the initial contact point for entities  for operational support and advises on all areas of human resources management.  Entities  may request advice and support from HRSD via e-mail at DOS-HR-Advice@un.org.                 13    46. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance provides policy leadership in all  management areas as follows:  a. The Global Strategy and Policy Division within the Office of Human Resources can be  approached by HRSD for authoritative policy guidance and interpretation on any HR topic.   b. DMSPC is also responsible for monitoring, evaluation and accountability mechanisms to  oversee the exercise of increased delegated authorities. The Business Transformation and  Accountability Division (BTAD) can be approached for questions related to accountability.    47. The Ombudsman's Office provides a wide array of conflict resolution and mediation services that can  be used to preempt the escalation of issues to the formal appeals mechanisms.  HoEs are ultimately  accountable for the outcome of the downsizing process, and issues and concerns should be brought  to the attention of the HoE in the first instance.        48. Below are a number of related policy provisions that those involved with downsizing processes should  familiarize themselves with:  a. ST/SGB/2023/1/ on Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, including provisional Staff Rules, of the  United Nations  b.

Introduction    1.  This OHR Policy Guideline provides the updated monthly cost of living (COLA) rate for  duty stations in New York and Nairobi. This was the result of the review of OHR of the  cost-of-living and rent level changes over time based on the movement of the Housing  index and In-Area without Housing index of the Post Adjustment Index (PAI) from 1  January 2014 to 31 December 2022.    2.  This Guideline also provides editorial changes to the new organizational structure  under the management reform effective since 1 January 2019, including the Office of  Human Resources (OHR) and the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs  (DPPA).     3.  The OHR Policy Guideline does not replace the applicable Staff Regulations and Rules  and the relevant administrative issuances which, in case of conflict with the provisions  in these Guidelines, shall prevail.    4.  For policy guidance on any specific case, the staff member should follow the usual Tier  system workflow, i.e. reach out to DOS colleagues, as Tier 2, at DOS-HR-Advice dos- hr-advice@un.org). DOS will escalate to OHR Policy as Tier 3 those queries for which  further authoritative policy interpretation and advice may be needed.    5.  These OHR Policy Guidelines will remain under continuous review and be revised as  necessary.       II.  General provisions and purpose    6.  The present guidelines provide the framework that governs the hiring and  administration of individuals engaged as consultants in Groups and Panels of Experts  (herein also referred to as Groups and/or Panels), including the Office of the  Ombudsperson, (hereafter referred to as ""members of Panels of Experts"" or ""Experts"")  of the Security Council to support its sanctions regimes. The guidelines apply  exclusively to Experts engaged to serve on bodies 1 established and mandated by  Security Council resolutions.   7.  The provisions of ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended, on Consultants and individual  contractors, are applicable to these Experts, to the extent that the guidelines differ  with the provisions that govern Consultants and individual contractors. Issues which    1 These bodies comprise of panels, groups, teams of experts mandated by Security Council resolutions to support the work  of the Committees and the 1540 committee.  Page | 4                      are not covered in the present guidelines shall be regulated by the provisions of the  above- mentioned administrative instruction (ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended).  8.  Pursuant to paragraph 7 above, the exceptional measures presented in this document  do not prejudice the fact that Experts serving on these Security Council Groups or  Panels are consultants within the meaning of ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended. No other  group/panel/team or consultant shall be entitled to the exceptional provisions of  these guidelines, including other consultants who may be engaged to support the  Security Council members of Panels of Experts themselves.  9.  In addition to addressing the audit recommendation 2 identified by the Office of  Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), which, inter alia, pointed out the need for a  comprehensive policy regulating the ad hoc exemptions and waivers granted over the  years, while acknowledging the unique status of Panels and Groups of Experts  established by the Security Council, these guidelines also take into account the  content of the memorandum dated 17 August 2010 from the Office of Legal Affairs  (OLA) on the 'Contractual status of DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)  Panel of Experts', specifically, on the verification of attendance and the subsequent  deductions of a proportionate amount from fees and/or COLA when attendance  cannot be verified and the requirement for Experts to be based at their duty station  of assignment, which confirms the understanding of the Office of Human Resources  (OHR) on the matter of contractual status and related implications of this special type  of Consultants.  10.  Part I of the present guidelines sets out the special conditions for Experts appointed  to serve on the Security Council's Groups and Panels. Part II addresses the modalities  for remuneration and adjustment of fees, and where applicable, the Cost of Living  Allowance. Part III provides general information on travel and related allowances. Part  IV provides additional general information on consultancy for Experts in Groups and  Panels.   11.  In addition, annexes I and II to these guidelines define the generic terms of reference  of Coordinators and Experts, respectively, serving on sanctions monitoring Groups and  Panels managed by the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA).  Annex III describes the procedures for the selection of consultants engaged as Experts  serving in Groups or Panels.             2 Assignment No. AP2010/560/01  Page | 5                      Part I:  Special conditions for Experts appointed to serve on the Security  Council's Groups and Panels    III.  Exceptional arrangement for Experts under the regulatory framework  on Consultants    12.  Owing to the unique status of Security Council established bodies, the exceptions in  the present guidelines to the provisions of ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended, in the  selection and administration of the Experts, are intended to satisfy the two following  key requirements:  a) to attract and engage qualified Experts suitable to the terms and requirements  of the Security Council's programme of work and decisions; and  b) to retain them over extended periods of time, not exceeding five years, subject  to satisfactory performance and mandate renewal.    13.  Pursuant to section 5.4 of ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended, and paragraph 15 below,  consultants are not staff members of the United Nations and therefore are not  entitled to the United Nations common system of salaries, benefits and allowances  applicable to the staff of the United Nations. Their fee is determined by reference to  OHR's policy for remuneration of consultants as prescribed in the Expert's contract.      IV.  Selection process    14.  Pursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions, the Security Council may request  the Secretary General to appoint Experts to perform a specific mandate in support of  the relevant Committee of the Security Council. The Security Council will determine  the duration and scope of each mandate and subsequent extensions.    15.  Pursuant to paragraph 7 above, Experts are contracted through a consultancy contract.  Experts serve in their individual capacity and not as representatives of a government  or of any other authority external to the United Nations. They are neither ""staff  members"" under the United Nations Staff Regulations and Staff Rules nor ""officials""  for the purpose of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United  Nations of 13 February 1946 (the Convention). Experts engaged as consultants may  be afforded the status of ""Experts on mission for the United Nations"" within the  meaning of article VI, section 22 of the Convention. The provisions of ST/SGB/2002/9,  Page | 6                      that provides the Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials  other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission, shall apply to Experts.      16.  For the duration of their assignment Experts shall report directly to the relevant  Committees and the Security Council, and they shall come under the overall  management of the United Nations administering Department or Office3, who shall  provide Experts with substantive advice, guidance and support; and evaluates their  performance for suitability for continued service on Groups and Panels.    17.  The selection of the Experts will be carried out by the Secretary-General in  consultation with the relevant Committee of the Security Council. The Secretary  General will inform the President of the Security Council of the names of the selected  Experts.     18.  In addition, the Secretary-General retains the sole prerogative to appoint a  Coordinator, from the list of Experts approved by the relevant Committee of the  Security Council, to undertake the tasks enumerated in annex I, which provided the  generic guidelines (which may be tailored to the needs of specific Groups or Panels).   Coordinators, by virtue of their appointment by the Secretary-General, are guided by  and consult closely with the relevant Committee Secretaries for this aspect of their  work.     19.  The selection process, contractual terms and conditions applicable to consultants  serving as Experts are governed by ST/AI/2013/4 or as amended, except as otherwise  provided in the present guidelines. Annex II provides the procedures used for the  selection of consultants working on Groups or Panels.       20.  Experts may be required to be based at a location other than their normal place of  residence. In such instances, except when on authorized official business travel or  breaks, Experts shall be required to be based at the location of their assigned duty  station.    21.  When the terms of a consultancy contract of an Expert are extended or when an  Expert is reengaged the terms of the consultancy shall be fully applicable without  regard to any prior period of engagement.               3 The Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (Security Council Affairs Division) and the Office of  Disarmament Affairs currently administer the sanctions Groups and Panels.    Page | 7                      V.  Contractual framework    22.  The contractual obligations of both the Organization and the Experts shall be  formalized and governed by the standard form P.104, entitled Contract for the  services of a Consultant or Individual Contractor. The form shall be counter-signed by  the Experts.    23.  Except as provided under paragraph 27 below, the duration of the contract shall  generally conform to the limitation of section 5.8 of ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended,  on the duration of consultancy contracts (maximum 24 months of service within a  36 month period).  24.  The General Conditions of Contracts for the Services of Consultants or Individual  Contractors, as contained in Annex I to ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended, shall also form  part of the Expert's contract. The General Conditions provide Experts with information  regarding their legal status as consultants, their obligations, title rights, termination of  contract, travel, insurance, service-incurred death, injury or illness, arbitration and  taxation.  25.  The consultancy contract, irrespective of the length of service and duration of the  mandate of the Security Council established Panel or Group, does not carry an  expectation, legal or otherwise, of renewal, and, if renewed, to the same conditions  and terms.  26.  Experts are subject to the provision of United Nations Administrative Instruction  ST/AI/2010/3/Rev.2, or as amended, which stipulates that ""interns, consultants,  individual contractors and gratis personnel may not apply for or be appointed to any  positions in the Professional or above categories and for positions at the FS-6 and FS- 7 levels in the Field Service category within six months of the end of their current or  most recent service.""  Exceptional extension of consultancy contracts beyond the 24-month within 36-month  period  27.  Pursuant to paragraph 23 above,  and taking into account the continuing need of the  Security Council for the expertise of highly specialized Experts and the limited pool  of qualified candidates, the limitation provided under section 5.8 of ST/AI/2013/4,  or as amended, may be applied with certain flexibility as reflected in paragraph 28  below in consideration of the duration of the mandate of the Panel of Experts.    Page | 8                      28.  In and by analogy with the provisions of section 5.8 of ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended,  Experts shall not be authorized to provide services for more than 60 months in a 66- month period.  29.  Upon reaching the five-year limit provided in paragraph 28 above, Experts will be  ineligible for any engagement, including under a consultancy contract, for a  minimum period of 6 months.  30.  All requests for the exceptional extension of the consultancy contracts beyond the 24- month within a 36-month period shall be submitted to the relevant executive or  administrative office for review and approval as soon as the need for renewal beyond  the authorized duration is known. The request should provide adequate justification  and it should be accompanied by the relevant supporting documentation as required,  i.e., Terms of Reference (TORs), performance report, work plan etc. The executive or  administrative office shall inform OHR of any renewals leading to service of more  than 24-months within a 36-months period.      VI.  Performance evaluation applicable to Experts managed by DPPA  31.  Experts managed by DPPA are subject to an evaluation process which is based on their  fulfilment of their consultancy contract with the Organization.  This in turn is based on  the relevant Security Council mandates, and established terms of reference (on the  basis of which they accepted the consultancy contract with the United Nations).  Apart  from fulfilment of their deliverables stated in the terms of reference, which amongst  others will stress attention to the timeliness and quality of their work, Experts are also  evaluated on the various United Nations competencies listed in their terms of  reference.   32.  Pursuant to paragraph 31 above, and in line with provisions of ST/AI/2013/4, or as  amended, Experts will be evaluated by DPPA at the end of the contract period.    33.  DPPA shall draw on a range of inputs to complete its evaluation of a consultant  (including the Coordinator) serving as an Expert; these include but are not limited to  feedback from:    (a)  The Chair and Member States of the relevant Committees;    (b)  Fellow Experts, the relevant Committee Secretary, senior officials of the  department or office tasked with managing the Group or Panel;    (c)  The Political Affairs Officers supporting Groups or Panels;    Page | 9                      (d)  Any other partner of organization that works with the Group or Panel;    (e)  The consultants themselves at any point during the consultancy/mandate as  well as during the interview process;    (f)  Any other sources, as deemed appropriate by the Secretariat in assessing the  work of the consultants.      Part II: Remuneration and adjustment of Fees, and where applicable, the  Cost of Living Allowance    VII.  Fees, and where applicable, Cost of Living Allowance    34.  The level of remuneration payable to Experts shall be determined in accordance with  section 5.12 to 5.15 of ST/AI/2013/4, or as amended, and the provisions of these guidelines.  Where applicable a Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) may be payable in accordance with  paragraph 37 through 39, 41 and 40 of the present guidelines.    i)  Fee:  35.  The honorarium payable to the Experts shall be determined by reference to the level  of work, the complexity of the assignment, the degree of specialization, knowledge,  qualifications, experience and skills required in accordance with Annex III of ST/AI/2013/4 or  as amended.  36.  Subject to OHR's approval, an increase of the fees may be authorized only upon  completion of at least 12 months of cumulative service and satisfactory deliverables. An  increase in fees shall not, however, be automatic and will be at the discretion of OHR.    ii)  Cost of Living Allowance (COLA)     37.  The COLA is an ad-hoc monthly lump-sum amount authorized by OHR on a case-by- case basis and represents the Organization's total contribution toward charges  associated with rented accommodation, meals and incidental expenses associated  with an Expert's assignment to an area or a country that is beyond commuting  distance from their normal place of residence in accordance with paragraphs 38 and  39 below.     Page | 10                      38.  Experts who are assigned to serve in an area or a country that is beyond commuting  distance from their normal place of residence may be authorized by OHR to receive  payment of COLA at the duty station of assignment, subject to meeting the  requirements of paragraph 39 below. Experts assigned to serve at a duty station that  is within commuting distance from their normal place of residence, notwithstanding  national boundaries, shall not be eligible to receive payment of COLA.    Eligibility requirements for COLA    39.  Pursuant to paragraph 37, in order to receive COLA, the Expert must have been  travelled at the Organization's expense to an area that is beyond commuting distance  from their normal place of residence and resides in rented accommodation or hotel  lodging at the duty station of assignment and incurs expenses as a result.        40.  The COLA is not payable to Experts who are assigned to serve at a duty station within  commuting distance from their normal place of residence, notwithstanding national  boundaries.     COLA rates    41.  The monthly COLA rate for each respective duty station where Experts are assigned  shall be established by the Office of Human Resources on a needs basis. In this respect,  the monthly COLA rates for the following duty stations were approved effective 1  March 2023, as follows:     Duty station of assignment   Monthly COLA  New York  US$ 6,600.00  Nairobi  US$ 4,800.00      VIII.  Adjustments of Fee and COLA (as applicable)    42.  Adjustments of the fee and COLA shall be undertaken under the following  circumstances:     i)  When an Expert's absence exceeds the fifteen working days (for fees) and  twenty-one calendar days (for COLA) of authorized breaks under Article IX below or  where their presence at the duty station of assignment cannot be verified by the  Department or Office in charge;    ii)  When an Expert does not provide proof of payment of hotel lodging or rented  accommodation at the duty station, including for any period of free rent in rent  Page | 11                      provided by the property owner; is provided with accommodation free of charge from  the United Nations, a Government or related institution; or owns a home at the duty  station of assignment;      iii)  Under the conditions provided in section 5.19 and 5.31 of ST/AI/2013/4, or as  amended, no adjustment will be made to the fee and COLA during periods of absence  from the duty station of assignment on official business travel or on authorized breaks.    43.  For the purpose of adjusting payments under paragraph 42 above, the daily fee shall  be determined by dividing the monthly consultancy fee by 21.75 working days per  month, while the daily COLA rate shall be established by dividing the monthly COLA  rate by 30 calendar days.    44.  The amount to be reduced from the monthly consultancy fee under paragraph 42 (i)  and (ii) above shall be calculated by multiplying the number of working day[s] an  Expert is absent under paragraph 42 (i) and (ii) above to the daily fee determined  under paragraph 43 above.     45.  In addition, the amount to be reduced from the monthly COLA shall be determined by  multiplying the number of calendar days of an Experts absence established under  paragraph 42 (i) and (ii) above to the daily rate calculated under paragraph 43 above.      46.  The amount of the COLA shall be reduced by 50 per cent in cases where an Expert  does not submit proof of payment of hotel lodging or rented accommodation in the  form of a lease agreement and proof of first month's rental payment for the lease  period, receives a period of free rent by a landlord, is provided with accommodation  at no charge by the United Nations, a Government or related institution or owns a  home at the duty station paragraph 42  (ii).     47.

Authorized break    49.  Pursuant to section 5.16 of ST/AI/2013/4, as consultants are not staff members, they  are not entitled to accrual or utilization of any paid leave days. However, in the case  of Experts, authorized breaks may be granted subject to meeting the following  conditions:    (a) where the duration of engagement giving rise to authorized break under  paragraph 51 below is 12 months or more.     (b) where the duration of engagement is less than 12 months and an Expert is  reengaged on a new consultancy contract without a break, giving a total  cumulative contract duration of not less than 12 months (i.e., shorter-term  consultancy contracts accumulating into a total of 12-months or more),     (c) Any unused authorised breaks from the previous engagement cannot be carried  forward to the new contract.     50.  For administrative purposes, the granting of the authorized break during the contract  period shall require prior approval by the administering department or office.    51.  Experts who are eligible for authorized breaks are permitted to take breaks of up to  15 working days of fees and 21 calendar days of COLA per 12 months of continuous  service in accordance with paragraph 42 (a) above.      52.

In such instances, any payments of fees or COLA made for  periods of authorized break will be recovered from the final payment of consultancy  fee and COLA.  53.  Unused authorized breaks cannot be carried forward or commuted to a cash payment  at the end of an Expert's tenure.      X.  Attendance control requirements    54.

The terms of reference outlines the specific deliverables for individual positions on the  Groups or Panels, and also includes the required technical and UN competencies against  which candidates will be evaluated in the interview process and throughout their service as a  consultant (see attached generic terms of reference, which will be modified for the specific  positions for the particular Group or Panel).    In the case of the establishment of a new Group or Panel, an initial list of candidates  is assembled by respective departments or offices. After a review of the initial list,  departments or offices invite shortlisted candidates for a United Nations competency-based  interview to ascertain their technical and substantive knowledge, skills, attributes and  behaviours, drawing from the competencies listed in the terms of reference. Reference  checks will be undertaken for candidates that may be proposed for service on Groups or  Panels.     In the case of a renewal of an existing Group or Panel managed by DPPA existing  experts will also be re-interviewed along with other new and potential candidates. As clearly  stated in section 4.4 of these guidelines, the consultancy contract does not carry an  expectation, legal or otherwise, of renewal and, if renewed, to the same conditions and terms.

Assessments of serving members are complemented an evaluation of their  performance, which is undertaken throughout the period of their consultancy.    On the basis of the interviews, a proposed slate of candidates is presented, through  the head of the respective department or office, to the concerned Committee for approval,  and subsequently appointed by the Secretary-General.     Interviewed candidates who were not proposed for service on a specific Group or  Panel but meet the technical and other competencies may be added to the department or  office's Roster of Experts and be considered for other similar positions on other Group or  Panel. Rostered candidates may be put through a modified interview process, as required,  before being selected for other Group or Panel.   "

Definitions - Purposes Post adjustment system: The overall goal of the post adjustment system is to equalize  the purchasing power of the remuneration of eligible UN officials in US dollars serving  in various locations around the world with the remuneration of their colleagues in New  York, which is the base of the system.  Post adjustment index (PAI): A statistical index designed to measure the cost of living  as experienced by internationally recruited staff members at a given duty station  relative to the base city, New York.   Post adjustment multiplier (PAM): Percentage of the net base salary that is added to  the net base salary to adjust to a relative difference in the cost of living between a duty  station and New York. Post adjustment multiplier may vary from month to month.  Accordingly, the actual post adjustment paid to newly onboarded staff members is the  one in effect at staff member's official duty station on the month in which staff  member reports for duty.  Cost-of-living surveys: Surveys carried out by the International Civil Service  Commission (ICSC) secretariat as part of the process of establishing a post  adjustment index to compare living costs between a given location and the base city,  New York, at a specified date.   Personal Transitional Allowance (PTA): an element of the gap closure measure  designed to mitigate the impact of negative cost-of-living survey results. If the PAI  resulting from the cost-of-living survey is less than the existing pay index (PAM+100)  by more than 3 per cent, a revised PAM equal to the survey PAI plus 3 per cent is  promulgated. The PTA is the difference between the existing PAM and the new PAM  paid in full for the first six months and then reduced by 3 per cent every four months  until it is phased out.  As per staff rule 3.6, post adjustment is payable to staff members serving in the  Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category.   _______________________________________________   _   08 December 2023  Page 2 of 6  II. Implementation of Personal Transitional Allowance (PTA) under ICSC/CIRC/GEN/08/2023 The change of the schedule of entitlement date for determining PTA eligibility as  described in ICSC/CIRC/GEN/08/2023, enclosed in the annex to this guideline, has not  changed the purpose of PTA, which is to facilitate the gradual transitioning of staff  members to a lower pay level.   Following the principle of PTA, staff members serving in the duty station during the  implementation month of the negative survey results are eligible for PTA, whereas  staff members not serving in the duty station during the implementation month of the  negative survey results are not eligible for PTA.   As per the above-mentioned circular, and the principles of PTA, staff members eligible  for post adjustment and already on post or onboarded at the duty station on or before  the last day of the month of the implementation of the negative survey results are  eligible for PTA.    In other circumstances such as secondment and special leave,  ICSC/CIRC/GEN/08/2023 outlines key considerations for eligibility for PTA; whether  the staff member was being paid or had a reasonable expectation of being paid at the  higher level, prior to the last day of the month of the implementation of the survey  results. What constitutes a reasonable expectation will depend on the specific  circumstances of a case, including, inter alia, the provisions of the applicable legal  framework, the provisions of any applicable policy guidance, and any undertakings or  assurances made by the Administration to the staff member.   The following table summarizes the most common scenarios to support HR local  offices to make decisions on PTA implementation under ICSC/CIRC/GEN/08/2023:  ELIGIBLE FOR PTA  Staff members (s/m) of the UN Secretariat or any UN common system organizations  serving / having continuity of service in the duty station on or before the last day of  the month of the implementation of the survey results and related PTA.  Scenarios  1. S/m encumbering a post at any post incumbency % other than zero during the  month of the implementation of the survey results.  2. S/m encumbering a post at 0% post incumbency, who started special leave  without pay (SLWOP) on or before the last day of the month of the  implementation of the survey results and related PTA.  3. S/m previously in receipt of PTA and returning from special leave without pay  (SLWOP) while PTA is still in effect.   4. S/m whose contractual status changes from a TA to FTA, FTA to TA, CA to TA  and CA to FTA, and who were employed on any type of appointment in the  Professional and higher or FS categories by a UN common system organization  at the duty station during the month of the implementation of the survey results  _______________________________________________   _   08 December 2023  Page 3 of 6  and related PTA, if the break in service was completed on or before the last day  of the month of the implementation of the survey results.  5. S/m returning to the Secretariat from secondment or loan from within the duty  station, irrespective of the date of return.   6. S/m returning to the Secretariat from secondment or loan from another duty  station on or before the last day of the month of the implementation of the  survey results and related PTA.   7. S/m coming to the UN Secretariat on transfer, secondment or loan from another  common system organization within the duty station, provided they were already  serving in that Organization on or before the last day of the month of the  implementation of the survey results and related PTA.  8. S/m coming to the UN Secretariat on transfer, secondment or loan from another  Organization outside the duty station, whose EOD is on or before the last day of  the month of the implementation of the survey results and related PTA.  9. New s/m whose EOD is on or before the last day of the month of the  implementation of the survey results and related PTA.  NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PTA  Staff members (s/m) of the UN Secretariat or any UN common system organizations  who did NOT serve NOR have continuity of service in the duty station on or before  the last day of the month of the implementation of the survey results and related  PTA.  Scenarios  1. New s/m whose EOD is after the last day of the month of the implementation of  the survey results and related PTA.  2. S/m returning to the Secretariat from secondment or loan from another duty  station after the last day of the month of the implementation of the survey  results and related PTA.  3. S/m coming to the UN Secretariat on transfer, secondment or loan from another  Organization outside the duty station, whose EOD is after the last day of the  month of the implementation of the survey results and related PTA.  _______________________________________________   _   08 December 2023  Page 4 of 6  Annex:  ICSC/CIRC/GEN/08/2023  _______________________________________________   _   08 December 2023  Page 5 of 6  _______________________________________________   _   08 December 2023  Page 6 of 6  "

"human resources","      _____________________________________________________________________________      Page 1 of 2      OHR Policy Guidelines  Measures to support staff who have been victim of hostage incidents.    OHR/PG/2024/1 - 19 January 2024    I. Scope and purpose    1. The present guidelines include administrative measures designed to support staff  member's well-being and mental health recovery after a hostage incident. These  administrative measures are meant to complement existing benefits and entitlements  (such as sick leave entitlement, compensation in the event of death, injury, or illness  attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations) and the  support provided by the Critical Incident and Stress Management Section / Department of  Safety and Security (DSS), and the Division of Health-Care Management and Occupational  Safety and Health (DHMOSH).     2. These guidelines do not replace the applicable Staff Regulations and Rules and the  relevant administrative issuances which prevail in case of conflict with the provisions in  these guidelines. They also do not replace the provisions of the United Nations Security  Management System (UNSMS) Security Policy Manual which prevail in case of conflict  with the provisions in these guidelines.     II. Definition    3. For the purposes of these guidelines, hostage-taking is defined as the seizure or detention  with a threat to kill, injure or to continue to detain individuals (hostages) in order to compel  a third party to do or to abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for  the release of the hostages. The authority to determine if a situation qualifies as hostage- taking rests with DSS.     III.  Support measures    Special Leave with Full Pay (SLWFP)    4. Under their delegated authority, heads of entity may make the following decisions:    a. Following their release, staff members may be granted up to 10 working days of  special leave with full pay (SLWFP), irrespective of the duration of their captivity.      b. For captivity that goes beyond 30 days, an additional 5 days of SLWFP per full  month of captivity may be granted, with an overall cap at 70 working days  (including the initial 10 days). This would amount to 15 days if a staff member is  held hostage for 2 months, 35 days if the captivity lasts for 6 months.     c. The SLWFP should be taken in units of one working week minimum (5 consecutive  working days) within 6 months from the release date or within the duration of the        _____________________________________________________________________________      Page 2 of 2      appointment as applicable (i.e., no extension of appointment for the sole purpose  of availing of SLWFP).     d. Consideration may be given to granting additional periods of SLWFP in case of new  or aggravating circumstances.     Annual leave carry-over     5. In cases where staff members have accumulated over 60 days of annual leave as a result  of their captivity, they may request an exception from ASG/OHR to staff rule 5.3.  Requests  will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant factors including  the reasons that led staff members to accumulate annual leave days prior to their captivity,  if applicable.      Measures for staff members who reached mandatory age of separation while in captivity    6. The appointment of a staff member who reaches the mandatory age of separation during  captivity will be extended on an exceptional basis for the duration of the hostage period.  Upon release, the staff member's appointment may be further extended for a period of  special leave with full pay sufficient to allow them to complete the required processes for  separation and retirement.  Such period should start immediately after the release and be  availed of in a continuous manner.     IV.   Other measures    Reassignment / change of functions    7. Some victims of hostage incidents may benefit from serving in another duty station, and  some may benefit from changing functions, including on a temporary basis. In  consultation with the staff member, counsellors, DHMOSH, supervisor etc., all efforts  should be made to identify and facilitate a working environment that would facilitate the  staff member's return to work.

"human resources","  _____________________________________________________________________________  1 | P a g e       OHR Policy Guidelines  Determination of continuous service for purposes of separation benefits (termination  indemnity, grant upon death and repatriation grant)  OHR/PG/2024/2 - 22 January 2024    I.  Continuous service     1. These guidelines are issued to assist in the determination of Entry On Duty (EOD)  used to calculate continuity of service for purposes of separation benefits such as  termination indemnity, grant upon death and repatriation grant.    2. One of the conditions of eligibility for these separation benefits is continuous  service.  The determination of continuous service is governed by staff rules 4.17  on Reinstatement and 4.18 on Reemployment as contained in the Staff  Regulations and Rules, including Provisional Staff Rules (ST/SGB/2023/1/Rev.1):    Staff rule 4.17 on Reinstatement provides that:   ""(a) A former staff member who held a fixed-term or continuing appointment  and who is re-employed under a fixed-term or a continuing appointment  within 12 months of separation from service may be reinstated under  conditions established by the Secretary-General.  (b) On reinstatement, the staff member's services shall be considered as  having been continuous, and the staff member shall return any monies  received on account of separation, including termination indemnity under  staff rule 9.8, repatriation grant under staff rule 9.12 and payment for accrued  annual leave under staff rule 9.10. The interval between separation and  reinstatement shall be charged, to the extent possible, to annual leave, with  any further period charged to special leave without pay. The staff member's  sick leave credit under staff rule 6.2 (Sick leave) at the time of separation  shall be re-established; the staff member's participation, if any, in the United  Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund shall be governed by the Regulations of the  Fund.    _____________________________________________________________________________  2 | P a g e     (c) A former staff member who held a temporary appointment and who is re- employed under a temporary or fixed-term appointment shall not be  reinstated regardless of the duration of separation from service.  (d) A former staff member who held a fixed-term or continuing appointment  and who is re-employed under a temporary appointment shall not be  reinstated regardless of the duration of separation from service.""  Staff Rule 4.18 on Re-employment provides that:  ""(a) A former staff member who is re-employed under conditions established  by the Secretary-General shall be given a new appointment unless the staff  member is reinstated under staff rule 4.17.  (b) The terms of the new appointment shall be fully applicable without regard  to any period of former service. When a staff member is re-employed under  the present rule, the service shall not be considered as continuous between  the prior and new appointments.  (c) When a staff member receives a new appointment in the United Nations  common system of salaries and allowances less than 12 months after  separation, the amount of any payment on account of termination indemnity,  repatriation grant or commutation of accrued annual leave shall be adjusted  so that the number of months, weeks or days of salary to be paid at the time  of the separation after the new appointment, when added to the number of  months, weeks or days paid for prior periods of service, does not exceed the  total of months, weeks or days that would have been paid had the service  been continuous.""  3. Continuous service for purposes of termination indemnity, grant upon death and  repatriation grant shall therefore be considered broken by separation from  service and payment of the corresponding separation entitlements, unless the  staff member was reinstated under staff rule 4.17. The administrative issuances  on Continuing appointments (ST/SGB/2011/9 and ST/AI/2012/3) and on  Downsizing or restructuring resulting in the termination of appointments  (ST/AI/2023/1) also consider continuity of service to be broken if a staff member  is separated and paid on account of termination indemnity, repatriation grant or  commutation of annual leave. When the continuity of service has been broken,  service accrued before the separation shall not count towards the completed  years of service for purposes of calculating the termination indemnity, grant upon  death or repatriation grant and the count begins anew upon re-employment.      _____________________________________________________________________________  3 | P a g e         II.  Situations in which service may exceptionally be considered continuous for  termination indemnity, grant upon death and repatriation grant    4. While the above represents the norm on how separations affect these entitlements,  in the following two situations, exceptions are hereby granted.    a. Prior to the 1 July 2009 contractual reform, for staff formerly appointed  under the former 100, 200 or 300 series of staff rules:  i. Service will be considered as continuous in cases where a  separation from service occurred prior to 1 July 2009 and did not  involve an interruption in employment with the United Nations for any  period (i.e. separation and reappointment the next day), regardless  of whether or not the staff member was paid on account of accrued  annual leave or other separation entitlements.  ii. For staff formerly appointed under the 300 series of staff rules who  were ""transitioned"" to a new fixed-term appointment under the new  staff rules on 1 July 2009 and who were paid accrued annual leave,  the service between the two appointments will be considered  continuous.  iii. For staff formerly appointed under the 100 series of staff rules,  service will be considered as continuous in cases where a separation  from service occurred before 1 July 2009 and involved an  interruption in employment with the United Nations for a period of 30  calendar days or less and which was imposed by the Organization  for administrative purposes only, regardless of whether the staff  member was paid on account accrued annual leave or other  separation entitlements.  iv. Staff members, other than those in peacekeeping missions, who  were transitioned to a new fixed-term appointment on 1 July 2009  and were subsequently allowed to be reappointed under a fixed-term  appointment following a three-working-day break for administrative  purposes: service of such staff will be considered as continuous in  cases where a separation from service occurred after 1 July 2009  and involved an interruption in employment with the United Nations  for a period of three working days or less that was imposed by the    _____________________________________________________________________________  4 | P a g e     Organization for administrative purposes, regardless of whether the  staff member was paid on account accrued annual leave or other  separation entitlements.    v. The above-mentioned exception is not applicable for the staff  members who were separated from service upon resignation, or  staff who voluntarily applied to and were selected for another  position which involved a separation from their previous  appointment, either on resignation or expiry of appointment, and  reappointment to the other position, including involving a different  category.    b. For staff separated from a fixed-term appointment and reappointed on  another fixed-term appointment without break in service (FTA to FTA  without BIS) after the 1 July 2009 contractual reform when administrators  used ""separation"" in lieu of using ""transfer"" and no separation payments  (including commutation of annual leave, termination indemnity,  repatriation grant, etc.) were made between appointments.   i. Example:  A UNMIT staff member with EOD 2 August 2010 who  separated on 1 October 2012 on resignation and was reappointed on  a fixed-term appointment with UNAKRT on 2 October 2012.   ii. Provided that the staff member did not get any separation payments  between the UNMIT and the UNAKRT appointments, the EOD for  purposes of separation entitlements when the staff member  separates from UNAKRT will be the initial appointment in UNMIT, i.e.  2 August 2010) and not 2 October 2012, the date of the most recent  reappointment.  If the staff member received any separation  payments, including commutation of annual leave, the EOD will be  the most recent reappointment, i.e. 2 October 2012.    c. For each case that service is exceptionally considered continuous in these  two situations, the entity is required to inform the Office of Human  Resources at ohr-policysupport@un.org so the exception can be recorded  under the authority of the Under-Secretary General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance.    5. Separations and reappointments that do not fall within these two scenarios are  considered as breaking the continuity of service as per staff rule 4.18 unless there    _____________________________________________________________________________  5 | P a g e     is reinstatement under staff rule 4.17. This includes but is not limited to:  separations from temporary appointments followed by reappointments the next  day on a fixed-term appointment; or separations from the GS category on fixed- term appointments, with or without separation payments, that are followed by a 7- day break and a reappointment into the FS category on another fixed-term  appointment (section 3.11 of ST/AI/2013/1 refers).    III.  Specific eligibility provisions for repatriation grant    6. While the two exceptions are applicable to all three separation entitlements  (termination indemnity, grant upon death and repatriation grant), in the case of  repatriation grant, the EOD used for calculation of this entitlement may still differ  from the one used for continuity of service, as consideration needs to be given  as to whether the staff member was eligible for this international entitlement for  the whole duration of their continuous service.      7. Some examples that would result in a different EOD for repatriation grant purposes  involve situations in which the staff member held different appointments and not  all appointments carried an entitlement to repatriation grant, such as:    a. Time served under an appointment subject to local conditions of  recruitment followed by an appointment subject to international  recruitment (i.e. General Service or National Professional Officer to Field  Service or International Professional Officer);    b. Time served under a 300 Series Appointment of Limited Duration (ALD),  which did not have repatriation entitlements.      8.  Staff members holding a permanent or continuing appointment who separated  from the General Service category and were reappointed and reinstated will have  the original EOD of the General Service appointment for the purpose of calculating  the termination indemnity and/or grant upon death. However, for repatriation grant  purposes the staff member is not entitled to it until the change of category took  place and gave rise to international benefits.      9. Time served under ALD appointments with successive breaks can exceptionally  be considered continuous under the provisions of paragraph 4 above.  However,    _____________________________________________________________________________  6 | P a g e     for purposes of repatriation grant, the entitlement will begin when the staff  member acquired entitlement to repatriation grant.      10.  Examples:    a. GS to FS  * General Service appointment EOD date:  15 July 2006  * Separation from GS appointment:  18 June 2010  * Reinstatement as Field Service category: 19 June 2010  While the EOD for termination indemnity and grant upon death will be the  15 July 2006, the entitlement to repatriation grant only exists upon joining  the Field Service category, the EOD for repatriation grant purposes will thus  be 19 June 2010.  b. 300 series to 100 series:   * ALD effective date 15 July 2007  * Transitioned to fixed-term appointment:  1 July 2009  * EOD on ALD:  15 July 2007  While the EOD for termination indemnity and death grant case will be 15  July 2007, the EOD for repatriation grant purposes will be 1 July 2009, date  of entitlement to repatriation grant upon conversion to a fixed-term  appointment under the Staff Rules.

"human resources","              Policy Guideline  Administration of fixed-term appointment limited  OHR/PG/2024/03 - 20 March 2024      1.  This OHR Policy Guideline provides information on the modality of fixed-term  appointment limited (hereinafter ""FTA-limited""), in accordance with section 2.2 (b) of  ST/AI/2013/1 on Administration of fixed-term appointments, where the candidate is  selected but not reviewed by a Secretariat review body.      2.  It does not replace the applicable Staff Regulations and Rules and the relevant  administrative issuances which prevail in case of conflict with the provisions in this  Guideline. This guideline does not apply to entities with specific administrative  issuances governing personnel arrangements 1 . It also does not apply to the  administration of appointment for Junior Professional Officers nor personnel seconded  by the governments to the United Nations.     3.  While the FTA-limited is an option for entities to consider, it is not a requirement. The  current contractual framework of continuing, fixed-term and temporary appointments  does not change.    Use and administration of FTA-limited    4.  Heads of entity must decide whether FTA-limited would be granted or not prior to  posting the Job Opening. FTA-limited may be used for finite or project-related needs  with mandates of one year or more. They cannot be used to fill geographical positions  subject to the system of desirable ranges.      5.  A special note should be included in the Job Opening, Offer of Appointment and in the  Letter of Appointment to indicate that the appointment is limited:     ""Candidate selected will be granted a fixed-term appointment limited (""FTA- limited"") in accordance with section 2.2 (b) of administrative instruction  ST/AI/2013/1 on Administration of fixed-term appointments.  United Nations  Secretariat staff members who meet the definition of ""internal candidate"" in staff  rule 4.10, who are selected for a position subject to FTA-limited will be reassigned  to the position without a lien to their parent position.""     6.  The assessment of candidates for positions subject to FTA-limited must be conducted  in accordance with ST/AI/2010/3/Rev.3, as revised or amended.  However, selection of  candidates for FTA-limited are not reviewed by Secretariat central review bodies.       1 Office of Internal Oversight Services whose personnel arrangements are governed by ST/AI/401, and  as amended by ST/AI/2003/4, on Personnel arrangements for the Office of Internal Oversight Services.  Page | 2                  7.  The initial FTA-limited must be granted for a minimum period of one year. Heads of  entity may extend the appointment, for up to maximum of two years at a time, provided  continuity of the mandate and funding.     Impact on staff serving on FTA-limited    8.  Mobility and continuing appointment: staff members holding FTA-limited are not  included in the mobility exercise and are not considered for conversion to continuing  appointment. Periods of service on FTA-limited are not counted towards the qualifying  period of service for continuing appointment.     9.  Lateral reassignment within the entity: staff members holding FTA-limited cannot be  laterally reassigned.    10.  Application to Temporary Job Openings: if staff holding FTA-limited apply to a  Temporary Job Opening and are selected, they must resign and be re-appointed on a  Temporary Appointment, as they are not ""internal candidates"" referred to in staff rule  4.10. Staff members holding FTA-limited are not eligible for temporary assignments.     11.  Roster: as selections on FTA-limited are not reviewed by the central review bodies, the  selected candidates are not eligible to be included in rosters.     12.  Application to positions that are not subject to limitation: staff members holding FTA- limited may apply for any other positions in the Secretariat and be selected. If staff  members are selected for a position following review by a Secretariat review body, they  will no longer be subject to the limitation effective from the date of assumption of the  new position.    13.  Benefits and entitlements: staff members holding FTA-limited have the same benefits  and entitlements as other staff on fixed-term appointments without limitations.     UN Secretariat staff members applying to positions subject to FTA-limited    14.  UN Secretariat staff members holding permanent, continuing or fixed-term  appointments applying to positions subject to FTA-limited retain their contractual status  while on the positions subject to FTA-limited.     15.  Therefore, the selection of a UN Secretariat staff member holding a continuing,  permanent or fixed-term appointment to a position subject to FTA-limited will be  processed as a reassignment, without a lien to the parent position.     16.  Staff members in general service or related category who have not passed the G to P  examination are not eligible to apply to positions subject to FTA-limited in the  Professional and higher category.    Staff members from other UN organizations applying to positions subject to FTA-limited     Page | 3                  17.  If a candidate from another UN organization is selected for a UN Secretariat position  that is subject to FTA-limited, the candidate can be seconded or loaned to the  Secretariat but not transferred. If the releasing organization does not agree to a  secondment or loan, the candidate will need to resign from their organization to join the  Secretariat on a FTA-limited.    Expiration and termination of fixed-term limited appointments     18.  In accordance with staff regulation 4.5 (c) and staff rule 4.13 (c), a fixed-term  appointment does not carry any expectancy, legal or otherwise, of renewal or conversion,  irrespective of the length of service. At the completion of the project or funding of the  position, staff members holding FTA-limited are separated upon expiration of  appointment in accordance with staff rule 9.4 unless their appointments are extended.  Staff members holding FTA-limited may be terminated in accordance with staff  regulation 9.3 and staff rule 9.6.      19.  In cases of abolition of post or reduction of staff, staff members holding FTA-limited will  be separated upon expiration of appointment in accordance with staff rule 9.4 if their  appointment expiration date coincides with the date of abolition of post or reduction of  staff.  If the expiration date of their appointment is beyond the date of abolition of post  or reduction of staff, they will be reviewed for possible retention within the downsizing  entity in accordance with ST/AI/2023/1. If there are no suitable posts in which their  services can be utilized within the downsizing entity, they will be terminated in  accordance with staff rule 9.6 as staff members holding FTA-limited cannot be  considered for retention outside the downsizing entity.

"human resources","                Policy Guidelines   Official travel: Compliance with the advance purchase policy    OHR/PG/2024/5 - 03 July 2024    General provisions    1.  These OHR Policy Guidelines provides information on the implementation of General  Assembly (GA) resolutions 75/253B and 77/263B on the advance purchase policy. These  resolutions have been incorporated into the organization's policy framework through  ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel, which came into effect on 1 July 2024.    2.  It should be noted as well that in its resolution 77/263B, the General Assembly requested  the Secretary-General to provide detailed disaggregated statistical information (by entity  and travel category) for all travel requests not compliant with the advance purchase policy  through the biennial report on standards of accommodation for air travel.  This includes  all non-compliant travel, regardless of class of travel.    3.  These guidelines do not replace the applicable Staff Regulations and Rules and relevant  administrative issuances, which prevail in case of conflict with the provisions in these  Guidelines. They will remain under continuous review and be revised as necessary.    Scope    4.  These guidelines apply to all travellers whose travel is funded by the Organization. This  includes staff and non-staff (including consultants, individual contractors, and individuals  without any contractual relationship with the Organization such as meeting participants).  However, it is important to note that these guidelines do not apply to members of  subsidiary organs, committees, councils and commissions of the United Nations, which  are administered as per ST/SGB/107/Rev.6 on travel of members of organs or subsidiary  organs.     5.  The process for exceptional approval by USG/DMSPC for travellers who are not entitled  to travel above economy to upgrade their standard of accommodation via the TTS. 3 form  remains unchanged and is outside the scope of these guidelines.  Notwithstanding, in  cases where travel above economy class has been exceptionally approved via a TTS.3  form, the travel requests should still be submitted 21 days before the start of travel.  However, in the event of late submission, the traveller is still entitled to travel in the class  as approved in the TTS.3 form.     6.  These guidelines apply to all types of travel funded by the Organization including HR travel  e.g., initial appointment, reassignment and separation.      Page | 2                    Definitions    7.  For the purpose of these guidelines:    a) Travel and Shipment Approver (TSA): the official with delegated authority to  certify travel requests for the entity (including for the head of entity) in accordance  with ST/SGB/2019/2 on Delegation of Authority in the administration of the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules and as recorded in  the delegation of authority portal. A TSA is a certifying officer under Financial Rule  105.5.    b) HR Partner: The official who reviews eligibility for HR and/or entitlement travel in  accordance with the relevant HR policies.     c) Travel Processing Officer (TPO): the official approving the travel request after  TSA certification. A TPO is an approving officer under Financial Rule 105.6.    d) Travel administrator (TA): the official who may raise a travel request on behalf of  a traveller.  As such, references in these guidelines to ""travellers"" also include  ""travel administrator"".        Policy provision    8.  According to section 3.3 of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel, travel arrangements for  all travellers should be finalized 16 calendar days before the start of official travel (the  advance purchase policy). Compliance with the advance purchase policy is regulated as  follows:    ""(a) Travellers are requested to submit their travel request a minimum of 21  calendar days before the commencement of the official travel;     (b) In the case of home leave, family visit and education grant travel, failure of staff  members to submit their travel request a minimum of 21 calendar days in advance  of travel will disqualify the staff members, regardless of their level, from requesting  that the Organization purchase the tickets for such travel. The staff members will  only be eligible to receive a lump sum;     (c) In the case of other types of official travel, where the traveller is entitled to travel  above economy class under normally applicable rules, a prerequisite for  undertaking travel above economy class for all United Nations travellers, except at  the level of Assistant Secretary-General and above (and eligible family members),  is the submission of their travel request a minimum of 21 calendar days in advance  of travel, subject to the following:   Page | 3                      (i)  In situations where travel documents are delayed and the travel request  has not been submitted a minimum of 21 calendar days in advance of  travel, the head of entity has discretionary authority to approve travel above  economy class. Such approval must be recorded in Umoja for accurate  reporting to the General Assembly;     (ii)  In events such as critical incidents or natural disasters, unforeseen  circumstances, late invitations from Member States, emergencies or other  immediate or urgent operational requirements necessitating immediate  travel and therefore resulting in non-compliance with the advance  purchase policy, the head of entity has discretionary authority to approve  travel above economy class. Such approval must be recorded in Umoja for  accurate reporting to the General Assembly.""      Consequence for non-compliance with the 21 days requirements    9.  It is always recommended that travellers submit their travel requests in UMOJA as early  as possible. If a traveller becomes aware that they cannot submit the request 21 calendar  days prior to the anticipated travel date, they should discuss the situation with the TSA.  This discussion should explore whether physical travel is necessary, if travel dates can be  adjusted, and if not, what is the appropriate 'late submission reason' to be selected and  explanation to be entered in UMOJA. Taking this proactive approach may result in a faster  approval process by avoiding any time-consuming exchanges between the parties  involved, which might further delay the finalization of travel arrangements.    10.  The current policy framework allocates five calendar days from the time of the submission  of any travel request until approval by the Travel Processing Office (TPO); namely, three  days for the TSA/HR Partner and two days for the TPO.    11.  The UMOJA system will include the below categories for travellers to choose from when  explaining their delay in submitting their travel request. Cases of non-compliance will be  reported to the General Assembly as per these categories:    Category  Description of category  1. Travel document delay*  The delay was a result of the late provision of a travel  document  2. Late invitation from Member  States*  The delay was a result of a late invitation from a UN  Member State  3. Emergencies/Exigency of  service/operational  circumstances*  The delay was caused by:  *  medical/DSS approved security evacuation;   *  critical incidents or natural disasters;   *  immediate or urgent operational requirements  Page | 4                    Category  Description of category  4. Late nomination of traveller  The delay resulted from the late nomination/substitution  of the traveller  5. Delayed confirmation by  traveller  The traveller did not confirm the travel details with  sufficient time to ensure the travel request is submitted in  time on their behalf  6. Trip budget/funding issue  The delay was a result of an issue related to  budget/funding details and/or budget insufficiency  7. Late event planning  The delay was a result of the organizer's late finalization of  the event   8. Late submission by traveller  The delay was a result of late submission by the traveller,  not related to any of the other listed justifications.    * Discretionary authority under section 3.3 of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel can only be exercised if  the traveller selected category 1, 2 or 3.    Exercise of discretionary authority under the delegation of authority framework    12.  Heads of entity have authority to authorize travel using the entity's financial resources,  and such authority may be subdelegated within the entity. The above table notes that there  are three scenarios where discretionary authority can be exercised. Heads of entities must  ensure that they, or the TSA exercising certifying authority certifying travel requests on  their behalf, have determined that one of the scenarios has occurred.    13.  To aid TSAs in reflecting the entity's decision in UMOJA, we strongly recommend that  heads of entity internally determine and communicate to their respective TSAs the  circumstances under which they could apply the three scenarios. This would include the  situations that can be considered emergency/exigency of service/ operational  circumstances. The TSA will justify their decision and record the non-compliance in Umoja.  Since the exercise of discretionary authority is not considered an exception, there is no  need to report such decisions to BTAD in the exception log.    14.  Although Section 3.3 of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 allows Heads of entity to exercise  discretionary authority under the three scenarios, such authority must be exercised with  the utmost responsibility and within the boundaries of the Organization's principles,  objectives and mandate. Heads of entity should also be ready to provide any additional  justification if requested by the ACABQ or the Fifth Committee.       IMPORTANT:    Discretionary authority can only be exercised to approve travel in the class above  economy for travellers who are entitled to travel above economy class under normally  applicable rules, despite not submitting their travel request 21 days before their travel.  Page | 5                    Discretion can only be exercised if the reason for delay falls into one of these  categories:    *  Travel document delay  *  Late invitation from a UN Member State  *  Emergencies/Exigency of service/operational circumstances    Therefore, the discretionary authority cannot be exercised if the traveller selected any  other category except of the above three. No exception can be made as this is a General  Assembly resolution.          Impact    15.  When travellers who are entitled to travel above economy class under normally applicable  rules do not submit their travel request 21 days prior to their official travel, they lose their  entitlement to travel above economy class and no longer have the option to voluntarily  downgrade, unless the entity exercises their discretionary authority and approves the  travel above economy class.    16.  If travellers submit their completed and accurate travel request on time (i.e. a minimum  of 21 calendar days prior to travel but the Organization does not process their request  within the 16 days limit required by the GA resolution, travellers are not penalized, and are  still allowed to travel above economy class (e.g. business class)  including premium  economy class where available if the voluntary downgrade indicator had been selected  upon request submission. The 16-day deadline is calculated based on the TPO approval  date. Therefore, all HR Partners/TSAs/TPOs are strongly encouraged to use the 'Priority'  column in their inbox/work center to sort travel requests by priority levels: very high, high,  medium, and low. These priorities are based on how close the trip start date is and may  aid that travel requests are approved 16 days prior to the date of travel when operational  circumstances permit.    17.  If travellers who are entitled to travel above economy class under normally applicable  rules, submit their travel request prior to the 21 days limit and subsequently request an  amendment of the initial request after the 21 days limit has passed, their request may still  be considered in compliance  if the TSA is of the view that the amendment is justified in  accordance with the circumstances under which their respective entity applies  discretionary authority, and raises the same in Umoja. The TSA approving the changes  should be mindful of the potential financial implication of such last-minute amendments.  The Organization should strive to process such changes in accordance with the advance  purchase policy.     Page | 6                    18.  If a travel request submitted before the 21 days limit is returned by HR Partner/TSA/TPO  to travellers as incorrect or incomplete and travellers re-submit the request less than 21  days before their travel begins, the travellers will no longer be eligible to travel in a class  above economy class, unless the head of entity/TSA/delegate exercises their  discretionary authority in accordance with section 3.3 (c) of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on  Official travel.              Page | 7                      ANNEX I Practical Examples    1. Travel document delay*   The delay was a result of the late provision of a travel document.    All travellers must ensure that their travel documents (e.g. national passport, UNLP, visas)  are valid at all times.  Prior to undertaking travel, they must check that their documents  have at least six months validity from the intended departure date of the country to be  visited. As a general rule, staff members should aim at a validity of their travel documents  of about one year.    Each case must be reviewed by the TSA on its own merits.  TSA should take into account  the circumstances of the delays, i.e., whether it is beyond the control of the travellers, or  whether the delay could have been anticipated/prevented.      Scenario 1:  The Traveller submitted a request for renewal of his travel document in a timely manner.   While the renewal is still pending, the traveler is asked to go on an official mission in the  coming weeks. In such a scenario the traveller should submit the travel request. The  process will continue, the entity may use their discretionary authority in this case to  approve travel above economy class, if the traveler is entitled to travel above economy  class under normally applicable rules.  In the event the travel document is not obtained on  time for the scheduled departure date after the ticket is issued, the traveller must cancel  the travel immediately to minimize the loss to the organization.    Scenario 2:  In the case of onboarding new personnel, a travel request cannot be submitted 21 days  before the official travel because the entry visa for the duty station is still pending. However,  as soon as the visa is released, personnel are expected to travel to take up their assignment  as soon as possible due to operational requirements. As such, the entity may use their  discretionary authority to approve travel above economy class where the traveller is  entitled to travel above economy class under normally applicable rules.    2. Late invitation from Member States*   The delay was a result of a late invitation from a Member State.    Scenario:  Traveller could not submit travel request within the 21 days limit because invitations for a  UN member state organized meeting (e.g. related to finalization of a donor agreement)  were issued less than 21 days before the date of travel.    The entity may use their discretionary authority to approve travel above economy class  where the traveller is entitled to travel above economy class under normally applicable  Page | 8                    rules. The Member State should be referenced when recording the non-compliance in  UMOJA.    3. Emergencies/Exigency of service/operational circumstances*  The delay was caused by:  *  medical/DSS approved security evacuation;   *  critical incidents or natural disasters;   *  immediate or urgent operational requirements.    Scenario 1:  Traveller submitted the travel request less than 21 days before the start of travel as a  member of the crisis response team on an urgent trip to the country that just experienced  a severe earthquake.     Scenario 2:  Traveller submitted a travel request less than 21 days before travel to respond to a complex  emergency for which the executive head of a UN organization has requested the support  of the UN.    For both scenarios, the entity may use their discretionary authority to approve travel  above economy class where the traveller is entitled to travel above economy class under  normally applicable rules    4. Late nomination of traveller  The delay resulted from the late nomination/substitution of the traveller.    Travellers could not submit the travel request until informed of nomination to attend by  their supervisor which was less than 21 days before the travel date.    Scenario:  An office selected a staff member to accompany a senior official to a conference only two  calendar weeks prior to travel. If the invitation is not from a Member State, or there is no  emergency/exigency of service/operational circumstances requiring the traveller to attend  the conference, this is not a scenario where the entity has the discretionary authority to  allow travel above economy class because this scenario would fall outside the scope of  section 3.3 of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel. Therefore, even if the traveller is  eligible for travel above economy class under normally applicable rules, the traveller is no  longer eligible to do so as the travel request was not submitted 21 days before the travel  date.    5. Delayed confirmation by traveller  The traveller did not confirm the travel details with sufficient time to ensure the travel  request is submitted in time on their behalf.     Page | 9                    Traveller failed to provide in the TA the necessary information to raise the travel request  21 days before the travel date.     Scenario:  Traveller provided necessary information to travel administrator less than 21 days before  the start of travel. If the invitation is not from a Member State, or there is no  emergency/exigency of service/operational circumstances requiring the traveller to travel,  this is not a scenario where entity has the discretionary authority to allow travel above  economy class because this scenario would fall outside the scope of section 3.3 of  ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel.  Therefore, even if the traveller is eligible for travel  above economy class under normal rule, the traveller is no longer eligible to do so as the  travel request was not submitted 21 days before the travel date. In this scenario the entity  may not exercise discretionary authority to allow travel above economy class .    6. Trip budget/funding issue  The delay was a result of an issue related to budget/funding details and/or budget  insufficiency.    Traveller could not submit travel request because of lack of budgetary funds.    Scenario:  The traveller was not able to obtain the fund code to raise the travel request 21 days before  the travel date.  If the invitation is not from a Member State, or there is no  emergency/exigency of service/operational circumstances requiring the traveller to travel,  this is not a scenario where the entity has the discretionary authority to allow travel above  economy class.  Therefore, even if the traveller is eligible for travel above economy class  under normal rules, the traveller is no longer eligible to do so as the travel request was not  submitted 21 days before the travel date. In this scenario the entity may not exercise  discretionary authority to allow travel above economy class.    7. Late event planning  The delay was a result of the organizer's late finalization of the event.    Traveller could not submit travel request within the 21 days limit because the  event/meeting details were confirmed by the organizer less than 21 days before the start  of travel.      Scenario:  Traveller was invited to present at a conference less than 21 days before the start of the  meeting.  The invitation is not from a Member State, or there is no emergency/exigency of  service/operational circumstances requiring the traveller to attend the conference, but it  was deemed important that the traveller is present. This is not a scenario where the entity  has the discretionary authority to allow travel above economy class. Therefore, even if the  traveller is eligible for travel above economy class under normal rule, the traveller is no  Page | 10                    longer eligible to do so as the travel request was not submitted 21 days before the travel  date. In this scenario the entity may not exercise discretionary authority to allow travel  above economy class.    8. Late submission by traveller  The delay was a result of late submission by the traveller, not related to any of the other  listed justifications.    Scenario 1:  Traveller could not submit the travel request within the 21 days limit due to Umoja system  unavailability.     Scenario 2:   Traveller could not submit the travel request due to illness.     As these scenarios do not involve an invitation from a Member State nor an  emergency/exigency of service/operational circumstances, the entity does not have the  discretionary authority to allow travel above economy class. Therefore, even if the traveller  is eligible for travel above economy class under normally applicable rules, the traveller is  no longer eligible to do so as the travel request was not submitted 21 days before the travel  date.

"human resources","REVIEW OF STAFF CLAIMS FOR DEPENDENCY BENEFITS FOR 2023 | 13 MAY. 24 | V.4  HRSD OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND ADVISORY SERVICE    UNITED NATIONS | DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT  1  GUIDELINES ON REVIEW OF STAFF  CLAIMS FOR DEPENDENCY BENEFITS  FOR 2023   Version 1     Information Circulars will no longer be issued for the annual Review of Staff Claims for Dependency Benefits. Starting  with the review year 2023, these guidelines replace the annual Information Circular on this matter.   1. The entitlement to dependency benefits is established in Staff Regulation 3.6 and Staff Rule 3.5 and  implemented under administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/6/Rev.1, entitled ""Dependency status and  dependency benefits"". The purpose of this guide is to inform staff members who were in receipt of  dependency benefits in 2023, of the review process and timelines for the exercise.     2. For ease of reference:  a. Annex I contains details on the types of dependency benefits.  b. Annex II contains contact information.  c. Annex III contains details on the documentation required for the continuation of benefits.    REVIEW OF STAFF CLAIMS FOR DEPENDENCY BENEFITS  I. REVIEW OF DEPENDENCY BENEFITS USING THE UMOJA ANNUAL  DECLARATION FORM AND TIMELINE FOR THE REVIEW    REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ON DEPENDENCY BENEFITS    3. The 2023 review of dependency benefits will be conducted in Umoja using the annual declaration form in the  Employee Self-Service module (ESS).    4. Staff members in receipt of dependency benefits for 2023 will receive an automated email from the  Department of Operational Support (DOS) with instructions on how to access their 2023 annual declaration  form in Umoja ESS in May 2024.    5. The declaration form contains information on a staff member's personal status and each recognized  dependant as of 31 December 2023. Staff members are required to review the information carefully:  *  If the data is correct, the staff member must certify the accuracy of the information contained in the form  and supply relevant additional information, including the answer to the question regarding the amount of  dependency benefit in the form of a government grant received for each child, if applicable.   *  If the data is incorrect, the staff member should indicate this on the annual declaration form in Umoja  ESS, certify and submit the form and liaise with their HR Partner to have their data corrected.    *  Supporting documentation should be attached for all cases requiring proof of support in the Umoja ESS  form, refer to Annex III for details.   ANNUAL DECLARATION FOR DEPENDENCY ALLOWANCE EXERCISE | 13 MAY. 24 | V.4  HRSD OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND ADVISORY SERVICE    UNITED NATIONS | DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT  2  6. Upon receipt of the instructions, staff members are required to electronically complete and submit their  certification as soon as possible, but no later than 60 calendar days from the date of the automated email  notification. The link in Umoja ESS will be deactivated 60 days from the date of the automated email  notification.   II. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  7. To confirm continued eligibility to receive certain dependency benefits, supporting documentation may be  required; refer to Annex III.    8. No documentation is required for the continuation of dependency benefits for the following dependants:   (a) An unemployed spouse who does not have income from: pension, such as retirement and disability  benefit(s), and earnings resulting from investments.  (b) A dependent child under the age of 18 years residing with the staff member and not receiving  dependency benefit in the form of a government grant.   (c) A dependent child over the age of 18 years for whom the staff member received an education grant  for the academic year in effect on 1 January 2023 or an advance for the 2023/24 school year.   Staff members must ensure all required documentation is uploaded to the annual declaration form in Umoja  ESS. Failure to submit required documentation may result in your submission being returned by your HR  Partner, partial or full immediate recovery and discontinuation of dependency benefits and could result in  disciplinary action.   9. Staff members must retain all required original documentation in support of an entitlement to dependency  benefits for a period of five years and must be ready to provide that documentation to their local human  resources office (Annex II, paragraph 2) or the Office of Internal Oversight Services upon request, within 30  days, for monitoring purposes (Annex III). Failure to do so may result in the immediate recovery and  discontinuation of dependency benefits and could result in disciplinary action as per ST/AI/2018/6/Rev.1.  10. When evidence of support payments is necessary, the following will be considered as acceptable proof of  payment: cancelled (i.e. paid) cheques, money order receipts, wire transfer receipts and original records of  bank transactions, including printouts of online bank transfer receipts, which must have been affected during  the calendar year in question.   11. Cash transactions are not considered to be acceptable proof of support.   12. Payments or transfers made to another party or person will not be accepted, except for cases where transfers  are made to a legal guardian or to a third party that is providing services directly to the secondary dependent  (e.g., nursing homes).   13. The submission of forged documents, the making of a false certification of the information contained in the  annual declaration form, or a misrepresentation of facts relating to a claim for dependency benefits may lead  to the initiation of a disciplinary process and the imposition of disciplinary measures.  III. RECOVERIES AND OVERPAYMENTS  14. In cases where staff members do not present adequate proof of support for dependants who do not reside  with them (eligible children as defined in Staff Rule 3.5 or a secondary dependant), the entire annual amount  of the dependency allowance paid to the staff member in respect of the dependant will be recovered, except  for cases of child dependency, where, subject to review of the circumstances, the recovery may be effective  as of the last day of attendance at an educational institution.  15. Staff members in receipt of dependency benefits for children or a secondary dependant not residing with them,  are encouraged to review their payslips for changes in the amount of the dependency allowances and, if  ANNUAL DECLARATION FOR DEPENDENCY ALLOWANCE EXERCISE | 13 MAY. 24 | V.4  HRSD OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND ADVISORY SERVICE    UNITED NATIONS | DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT  3  necessary, to adjust the amount of support provided to their dependants during the particular calendar year  under review, to be in compliance with the minimum support amounts required by the Organization.  This does  not refer to children in boarding school who normally reside with the staff member when not boarding to attend  school. Please refer to Annex III for additional details.  16. Dependency benefits will be discontinued and overpayment recovered in accordance with section 3 of  administrative instruction ST/AI/2009/1 when a staff member does not submit the annual declaration form and  any requisite documentation by the deadline stated in the automated email notification from Umoja. In addition,  the entitlement will be discontinued for the current year (2024) to avoid further recoveries.  17. Before the recovery of any overpayment, staff members will be advised in writing of the decision to recover  and of the reasons why. Recovery will be made through deductions of 20 per cent of the staff member's net  monthly salary until such time as the full amount is recovered. In instances where the duration of the staff  member's contract does not allow for a deduction at a rate of 20 per cent, the overpayment will be deducted  at a monthly rate that is sufficient to recover the full amount by the expiration date of the contract.   18. Staff members are reminded that, in addition to discontinuation of dependency benefits, non-compliance with  the submission deadline may also result in a determination that the claimed individuals are no longer  dependants, which could have an impact on the continuation of other benefits, including education grant,  education grant travel and home leave travel.   IV. ADDING DEPENDANTS RETROACTIVELY  19. In accordance with Staff Rule 3.15, if staff members have not been receiving an allowance, grant or other  payment to which they are entitled, they shall not receive retroactively such allowance, grant or payment  unless they have made a written claim within one year following the date on which they would have been  entitled to the initial payment.   20. Staff members wishing to add dependants can submit an electronic request through Umoja ESS, attaching  the required supporting documentation, or to their respective HR Partners. For details on the required  supporting documentation refer to Annex III.       ANNUAL DECLARATION FOR DEPENDENCY ALLOWANCE EXERCISE | 13 MAY. 24 | V.4  HRSD OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND ADVISORY SERVICE    UNITED NATIONS | DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT  4  Annex I     Types of Dependency Benefits       The conditions for the recognition of a 2023 dependency benefit for a spouse, child or children or a  secondary dependant of the staff member are set out in Staff Rule 3.5 (a) and in administrative  instruction ST/AI/2018/6/Rev.1. A summary of the policy references on eligibility are included below for  ease of reference.     Dependent spouse     A spouse is recognized as a dependant in 2023 when the spouse's gross earnings, if any, do not  exceed the limit established for this purpose as set out in Staff Rule 3.5 (a) (i) and in section 2 of  administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/6/Rev.1. Staff members are reminded that all earnings received  by a spouse, including but not limited to pension income, such as retirement and disability benefits,  and earnings resulting from investments, shall be included in the computation of the annual gross  earnings.   For staff members in the General Service and related categories and the National Professional Officer  category, the earnings limit for 2023 is the lowest entry level of the General Service gross salary scale  in force on 1 January 2023 for the closest United Nations duty station in the country of the spouse's  place of work.   For staff members in the Professional and higher categories and staff members in the Field Service  category, the earnings limit in 2023 for the spouse's annual gross earnings is the higher of:   (a) The lowest entry level of the General Service gross salary scale in force on 1 January 2023  for the closest United Nations duty station in the country of the spouse's place of work; or   (b) The gross salary for the lowest entry level in force on 1 January 2023 at the base of the salary  system (G-2, step I, for New York).   In New York, the earnings limit for 2023 was USD 48,830 (gross salary in effect on 1 January 2023 for  a staff member at the G-2, step I, level).     Dependent child or children     Effective 1 January 2017, dependency allowance(s) for a dependent child or children for staff in the  Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category are paid as flat sums.  The  conditions for the payment of a dependency benefit for 2023 for the dependent child or children of the  staff member are set out in Staff Rule 3.5 (a) (ii) to (iv) and in sections 3 of administrative instruction  ST/AI/2018/6/Rev.1.   Dependency benefits for 2023 for a child or children with a disability will be paid in accordance with  the provisions set out in section 5 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/6/Rev.1.     Dependent child allowance in the case of a single parent     For staff members in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field Service category, the  conditions for the payment of the single parent allowance in 2023 are set out in Staff Rule 3.5 (b) (ii)  and section 4 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/6/Rev.1.     Secondary dependent     The conditions for the payment of a 2023 dependency benefit for a secondary dependant of the staff  member are set out in Staff Rule 3.5 (a) (v) and section 6 of administrative instruction  ST/AI/2018/6/Rev.1. When a secondary dependant is recognized, a benefit will be paid at the rate  determined by the General Assembly for staff in the Professional and higher categories and in the Field  Service category. For staff in the General Service and related categories in New York, the allowance  will be paid in the amount set out in the local salary scales, as periodically revised. For other duty  stations, if applicable, the allowance will be paid in the amount set out in the local salary scales that  are established for each duty station.   ANNUAL DECLARATION FOR DEPENDENCY ALLOWANCE EXERCISE | 13 MAY. 24 | V.4  HRSD OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND ADVISORY SERVICE    UNITED NATIONS | DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT  5  Annex II     Contact Information       Staff members who are required to submit documentation in support of an entitlement to dependency  benefits for 2023, or who have any questions regarding dependency benefits or the annual declaration  form, should contact their respective HR Partner or local human resource office in line with established  local support channels.

The amount of support should be at least equal to  ANNUAL DECLARATION FOR DEPENDENCY ALLOWANCE EXERCISE | 13 MAY. 24 | V.4  HRSD OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND ADVISORY SERVICE    UNITED NATIONS | DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT  6  the amount of the child dependency benefit received from the  Organization.    In addition, in the case of minor children, a notarized affidavit from  the legal guardian must be provided attesting to the legal  guardianship of the child, that the child resides with the legal  guardian and that the staff member is providing continuous  support for the upkeep of the child.

Cash transactions are not considered acceptable proof of support,  nor is any payment made to or through a third party.    The amount of payment to be eligible for a child dependency  allowance should be at least the amount of the court-ordered child  support, or the amount of the child dependency benefit received  from the Organization, whichever is higher.    In the absence of a court document, an original notarized affidavit  from the custodial parent must be provided attesting that the staff  member provided continuing support and specifying the amounts  paid during the calendar year 2023, together with the proof of  payment described above.  (d) For a child between the  ages of 18 and 21a years  Staff members who were not in receipt of an education grant  should submit an original completed form P.41/B (certificate of  school attendance) for the academic years 2022/23 and 2023/24.  Where the academic year coincides with the calendar year, form  P.41/B should be submitted for 2023.

Pursuant to section 4.2 of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/1997/1 and for the purpose of implementing General Assembly resolution 59/268 of 23 December 2004, which approved the implementation of paternity leave throughout the common  system,  the  Under-Secretary-General  for  Management  amends administrative instruction ST/AI/400, entitled ""Abandonment of post"", as follows: Paragraph 5 is replaced by the following text: ""The absence of a staff member from his or her work, unless properly authorized as leave under staff rule 105.1 (b), as special leave under staff rule 105.2, as sick leave under staff rule 106.2 or as maternity or paternity leave under staff rule 106.3, may create a reasonable presumption of intent to separate from the Secretariat unless the staff member is able to give satisfactory proof that such absence was involuntary and was caused by forces beyond his or her control."" 2. The present instruction shall enter into force on 1 June 2005. Andrew Toh Officer-in-Charge Department of Management "
"human resources","UNITED UNITED ST NATIONS NATIONS Secretariat ST/AI/400 22 December 1994 ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTION To: Members of the staff From: The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management Subject: ABANDONMENT OF POST* BACKGROUND CONSIDERATIONS 1. The Department of Administration and Management and, in particular, the Office of Human Resources Management, believe it important for the staff to understand the various provisions of the Staff Regulations and Rules together with the administrative instructions designed to support their application. Accordingly, the Office of Human Resources Management will continue to address procedures that require greater clarity in order to provide staff members with a fuller understanding in keeping with the Secretary-General's commitment to improving transparency. 2. The present administrative instruction addresses a topic that applies to all staff members but is an issue for an extremely small number. Nevertheless, while acknowledging that the procedures will not apply to the great majority of staff members, it is believed that clarity and greater definition is required on the topic of what constitutes abandonment of post. OPERATIVE PROVISIONS 3. The purpose of the present administrative instruction, which supersedes instruction ST/AI/393 of 12 April 1994, is to define what constitutes abandonment of post and to set out the procedure to be followed in cases where a staff member may be deemed to have abandoned his or her post. ________________________ * Personnel Manual index No. 9035. 94-51337 (E) 281294 /... ST/AI/400 Page 2 What constitutes abandonment of post 4. Abandonment of post is a separation initiated by the staff member other than by way of resignation. It is considered a unilateral repudiation of the contract of employment and not a termination initiated by the Secretary-General as defined in article IX of the Staff Regulations and in staff rule 109.1 (b). The intent to separate may be presumed from the circumstances, in particular from the failure of the staff member to report for duty. 5. The absence of a staff member from his or her work, unless properly authorized as leave under staff rule 105.1 (b), as special leave under staff rule 105.2, as sick leave under staff rule 106.2 or as maternity leave under staff rule 106.3, may create a reasonable presumption of intent to separate from the Secretariat unless the staff member is able to give satisfactory proof that such absence was involuntary and was caused by forces beyond his or her control. 6. Acceptance of outside employment while on unauthorized absence or extended sick leave creates an even stronger presumption of intent to separate, particularly if the staff member is drawing full or partial salary from the United Nations on the basis of a medical certificate indicating that he or she is disabled to the extent that he or she is unable to go to work. Seeking outside employment while on unauthorized absence or extended sick leave may also create a presumption of intent to separate. In such cases the presumption would be drawn in the light of all the surrounding circumstances. The mere sending out of a resume or job application while on certified sick leave would not constitute abandonment of post and would not normally be construed as such. 7. Failure or refusal to undertake assigned functions may be construed as a performance/disciplinary issue. Therefore, the provisions of the present administrative instruction are not applicable to cases of unsatisfactory performance related to such failure or refusal, which are subject to the procedures set out in administrative instructions ST/AI/222 and ST/AI/371 dealing with termination of permanent appointment for unsatisfactory services and disciplinary measures and procedures, respectively. Temporary or occasional absences or failure to perform some of the duties of the post do not constitute abandonment. 8. If the staff member reports for duty within the period specified in any warnings issued pursuant to the present administrative instruction, the separation action shall be cancelled. The staff member may, however, be subject to reprimand or to disciplinary measures under staff rule 110.1. Procedure 9. Supervisors must report all unauthorized absences to the relevant executive or administrative officer, or the local personnel office in offices away from Headquarters, not later than the end of the fourth day of such absence. The executive or administrative officer should then endeavour to contact the staff member concerned by telephone or by any appropriate means, failing which a written communication should be addressed to the staff member at his or her last known address requesting him or her to report for duty or to provide a plausible explanation for his or her absence. In cases of claimed illness, the executive or administrative officer should call the staff member's attention to the /... ST/AI/400 Page 3 requirements of subparagraphs (v)-(vii) of staff rule 106.2 (a) (see para. 13 below). 10. Unless the executive or administrative officer receives a medical certificate or plausible explanation for the absence within 10 working days he or she shall refer the matter to the appropriate personnel officer, who should address a further written communication, by registered mail, personal delivery, or other appropriate means, calling the staff member's attention to the earlier attempts to contact him or her and the absence of an appropriate response. The communication should remind the staff member of the provisions of staff rule 105.1 (b) (ii), under which payment of salary and allowances shall cease for the period of unauthorized absence. It should allow a further period of up to 10 working days for reporting to duty or submission of a medical certification or plausible explanation, and should warn the staff member that failure to do so would be considered abandonment of post and would lead to separation on that ground. 11. It is the responsibility of staff members to inform their supervisors of absences, whether owing to illness or injury or any other cause. It is also the responsibility of staff members to keep the Organization informed of their current address and the person to be notified in case of accident or emergency. If, despite due diligence on the part of the Organization, the staff member cannot be reached or contacted, either in person, by registered letter or other reliable form of communication to the address most recently provided by the staff member, or through family or friends, receipt of such notice will be deemed to have occurred. 12. If by the end of the specified period the staff member has failed to comply with the warning to report for duty or to provide a plausible explanation or medical certificate, the Director, Staff Administration and Training Division, or the head of office at duty stations away from Headquarters, will submit a presentation to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, recommending separation for abandonment of post. The effective date of separation will be the date of the decision of the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management to treat the staff member's conduct as repudiation of the contract of employment, or the date of expiry of the fixed-term appointment, whichever comes sooner. Alleged incapacity for reasons of health 13. Where a staff member claims that his or her absence is the result of incapacity for reasons of health, his or her attention should be called to the provisions of staff rule 106.2 (a) (vi), which require the production of a certificate from a duly qualified medical practitioner stating the nature and probable duration of the illness. If the staff member fails to produce such certification or if the certification produced is not acceptable to the Medical Director and sick leave is not certified, the executive or administrative officer shall immediately advise the staff member, with a copy to the personnel officer, that sick leave has been refused and that the staff member must report for duty immediately or be separated for abandonment of post. If the staff member disputes the decision, he or she may request that the matter be referred to an independent practitioner or to a medical board under the terms of staff rule 106.2 (a) (viii). Pending a final decision following the report of the /... ST/AI/400 Page 4 medical board, the period following the date of notification that sick leave has been refused should be compensatable. However, should it be decided not to consider the period in question as sick leave, the remuneration received by the staff member during this period shall be recovered by the Organization. 14. The determination as to whether or not the staff member had a valid excuse for failing to submit evidence of incapacity, or a plausible explanation for the absence, within the prescribed or reasonable time limits, lies with the Office of Human Resources Management. Abandonment of post following annual or special leave 15. Where a staff member has been absent from duty on approved annual or special leave and has failed to report for duty on the expiration of the approved period of leave the supervisor shall report the matter to the executive or administrative officer, who will attempt to communicate with the staff member as in paragraph 9 above. If the staff member fails to report for duty by the end of the approved period and does not furnish a plausible explanation within 10 working days, the matter shall be referred to the Office of Human Resources Management for cases at Headquarters, or the head of office at duty stations away from Headquarters, whereupon the personnel officer or administrative officer concerned will proceed on the same lines as indicated in paragraph 10 above. Separation action 16. Upon approval of separation for abandonment of post, the personnel officer concerned will process the separation action and will notify the staff member at the address most recently provided by him or her, advising of the Secretary-General's decision and the effective date in accordance with paragraph 12 above. Separation for abandonment of post is not termination and therefore the staff member will not be entitled to any notice of termination or the payment of termination indemnity, and no repatriation grant is payable under the terms of staff rule 109.5 (i). ----- "

"human resources","United Nations ST/SGB/2006/5   Secretariat 22 March 2006 06-27979 (E)    280306 *0627979* Secretary-General's bulletin Acceptance of pro bono goods and services The Secretary-General hereby promulgates, in consultation with executive heads of separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations, the guidelines for the acceptance of pro bono goods and services, which are set out in the annex to the present bulletin. The present bulletin shall enter into force on 1 March 2006. (Signed) Kofi A. Annan Secretary-General 2 ST/SGB/2006/5 Annex Guidelines for the acceptance of pro bono goods and services Scope 1. The present guidelines apply to the acceptance of pro bono offers of goods and services (hereinafter ""pro bono contributions"") to the United Nations. The guidelines do not address cash contributions, which are adequately covered by the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and of the separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations. As used in the present guidelines, ""recipient"" means the department or office of the United Nations or the separately administered organs or programmes of the United Nations receiving or using the pro bono contribution. 2. Pro bono contributions are usually offered by the private sector and, for this reason, the present guidelines focus primarily on pro bono contributions from the private sector.1 Nevertheless, these guidelines apply, mutatis mutandis, to pro bono contributions from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) except as otherwise indicated. 3. The guidelines do not apply to pro bono contributions of which the Organization will not be the ultimate user, such as goods and services to be passed on to Governments, NGOs or individuals in connection with disaster relief. Similarly, the guidelines do not apply to pro bono contributions for United Nations activities established as technical assistance projects. In addition, the guidelines do not apply to procurement activities which contain pro bono components. 4. The guidelines contain general policies on the acceptance of pro bono goods and services and are not intended to replace rules or procedures promulgated by the separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations relating to pro bono contributions (whether referred to in such rules and procedures as ""in kind contribution"", ""in kind assistance"" or otherwise). Separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations are welcome to develop more specific guidelines in accordance with their particular mandates and activities consistent with the terms of the present guidelines. 5. The guidelines do not apply to offers of pro bono personnel or so-called gratis personnel. Rules regarding the acceptance of gratis personnel are contained in General Assembly resolutions 51/243 and 52/234 as well as in ST/AI/1999/6, entitled ""Gratis personnel"". The following criteria are indicative that the offer is not of gratis personnel: that the offer consists of the provision of services by the donor rather than the provision of personnel; that the services are to be provided under the donor's own responsibility, and the donor will be liable for acts and omissions of its personnel; that the donor's personnel are to be employed and managed by, and accountable to, the donor; and that the donor's personnel will not become functionally integrated within the recipient. __________________ 1 For the general framework regarding cooperation between the United Nations and the business community, please also consult the ""Guidelines on cooperation between the United Nations and the business community"", issued by the Secretary-General on 17 July 2000, available on the United Nations website at http://www.un.org/partners/business/otherpages/guide.htm. 3 ST/SGB/2006/5 General criteria for the acceptance of a pro bono contribution 6. A pro bono contribution may be accepted only in accordance with the relevant financial regulations and rules. 7. When a pro bono contribution is solicited by the recipient, a solicitation should, wherever possible and appropriate, be published by the recipient in such a manner as not to restrict the opportunities to make pro bono contributions to donors from particular regions or Member States. Typically, this guideline does not apply to a pro bono contribution by an NGO. 8. The decision as to whether to accept a pro bono contribution should be transparent. In this respect, the recipient should maintain records of the solicitation (if any), offers, evaluation of offers and considerations leading to the decision to accept an offer. 9. The proposed pro bono contribution should be evaluated, both with regard to operational factors (such as need, suitability and specifications of the goods and services offered) and the suitability and capacity of the donor. The operational factors should be evaluated by the relevant operational department or office of the recipient. The suitability and capacity of the donor should be evaluated by the recipient in consultation with the Procurement Service of the Office of Central Support Services or the relevant offices of the separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations concerned, as appropriate. Typically, the third sentence of the present paragraph does not apply to a pro bono contribution by an NGO. 10. In accordance with the relevant financial regulation or rule, the acceptance of a pro bono contribution shall in all cases be subject to approval by the controller or the relevant financial official of the separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations concerned. The substantive decision on the acceptance of a pro bono contribution shall be taken by the head of the operational department or office, in consultation with the offices typically involved in the process regarding the acceptance of a pro bono contribution, such as the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, the Office of Legal Affairs and the Department of Management, or the relevant offices of the separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations concerned, as appropriate. 11. A decision on the acceptance of a pro bono contribution shall take into account and conform to, as applicable, General Assembly resolutions 51/243 and 52/234 relating to gratis personnel, 55/232 and 59/289 relating to outsourcing and the information circular entitled ""Outsourcing and impact on staff"" (ST/IC/2005/30) or any other relevant resolutions or decisions of the General Assembly or the governing bodies of the separately administered organs or programmes of the United Nations. 12. A pro bono contribution should not be accepted from entities that are complicit in human rights abuses, tolerate forced or compulsory labour or use child labour, are involved in the sale or manufacture of anti-personnel mines or their components, or do not meet the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The recipient's decision on whether to accept a pro bono contribution should take into account, as appropriate, any other ethical or moral considerations that would reflect negatively on the Organization. 4 ST/SGB/2006/5 13. A pro bono contribution should not be accepted if it would create a conflict of interest. The recipient should examine whether the acceptance of the pro bono contribution would create a conflict of interest, or the appearance thereof, in which case the pro bono contribution should not be accepted. 14. The acceptance of a pro bono contribution should not result in de facto standardization of the donor's goods or services within the recipient, or create a need for further goods and services that can be supplied only by the donor, and should not give the donor an undue competitive advantage in a procurement exercise for the supply of further goods or services. Typically, this guideline does not apply to a pro bono contribution by an NGO. 15. A need for additional goods and services of the type offered by the donor, or goods or services ancillary thereto, should ordinarily be met through normal procurement processes. As a general rule, the donor should be allowed to participate in such a procurement exercise. Typically, this guideline does not apply to a pro bono contribution by an NGO, unless the NGO offers to provide goods or services that are available in the commercial market. 16. The acceptance of a pro bono contribution should not allow the donor a role in the internal decision-making process, or in any way compromise the integrity or independence of the recipient. 17. The donor should normally cover all of the recipient's costs and liabilities resulting from the acceptance of the pro bono contribution. The Office of the Controller, or the corresponding office of the separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations concerned, should be consulted as to the details of the recipient's costs and liabilities. Should these offices determine that the pro bono contribution, directly or indirectly, involves additional financial liability for the recipient, pursuant to the relevant financial regulation or rule, the established procedures shall be followed. 18. A pro bono contribution should be accepted only pursuant to a formal agreement between the donor and the recipient. An initial draft of such an agreement should be prepared by the relevant operational office or department of the recipient in consultation with the Office of Legal Affairs. 19. Where a particular recipient takes the lead with regard to the acceptance of a pro bono contribution (""lead agency"") and the contribution is to be used by a separately administered body or programme of the United Nations, a specialized agency or other organization of the system of the United Nations (""other users""), the lead agency shall be accountable in accordance with its own respective lines of accountability with regard to its acceptance and use of the pro bono contribution. The lead agency should consult with the other users with regard to the terms and conditions of the acceptance of the pro bono contribution. Recognition of a pro bono contribution 20. Entities making a pro bono contribution should be accorded appropriate acknowledgement or recognition by the recipient for the contribution. 21. The names and emblems of the United Nations and separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations shall not be used without prior authorization. In accordance with the established policy, the use of the names and 5 ST/SGB/2006/5 emblems of the United Nations and separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations by the donor for commercial purposes, including advertisement, display on websites or use in other promotional material, is generally prohibited. 22. Any acknowledgement or recognition of the donor's contribution, or any use of the names or emblems of the United Nations and separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations in connection with the contribution, shall be accorded in a manner that ensures that such acknowledgement or recognition does not imply the endorsement by the United Nations or separately administered organs and programmes of the United Nations of, or preference for or promotion of the donor or its activities, goods or services.

"human resources","  United Nations    ST/SGB/2019/8      Secretariat      10 September 2019        19-15446 (E)    170919  *1915446*         Secretary-General's bulletin         Addressing discrimination, harassment, including sexual  harassment, and abuse of authority         The Secretary-General, for the purpose of ensuring that all staff members and  non-staff personnel of the Secretariat are treated with dignity and respect and are  aware of their role and responsibilities in maintaining a workplace free of any form  of discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment, and abuse of authority,  and being mindful of the need to prevent such conduct and, if it occurs, to take timely  appropriate corrective action, while offering support to those targeted by such  conduct, promulgates the following:        Section 1      Definitions        Prohibited conduct    1.1 For the purposes of the present bulletin, discrimination, harassment, including  sexual harassment, and abuse of authority shall collectively be referred to as  ""prohibited conduct"". Disagreement on work performance or on other work-related  issues is normally not considered prohibited conduct and is not dealt with under the  provisions of the present bulletin but in the context of performance management.        Discrimination    1.2 Discrimination is any unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a  person's race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,  religion, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, age, language, social origin or other  similar shared characteristic or trait. Discrimination may be an isolated event  affecting one person or a group of persons similarly situated, or may manifest itself  through harassment or abuse of authority.         Harassment    1.3 Harassment is any unwelcome conduct that might reasonably be expected or be  perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another person, when such conduct  interferes with work or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work  environment.   1.4 Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions which tend to  annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another.  ST/SGB/2019/8      19-15446  2/13    Harassment may be directed at one or more persons based on a shared characteristic  or trait as set out in section 1.2 above. Harassment normally implies a series of  incidents.         Sexual harassment    1.5 Sexual harassment is any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might  reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such  conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an  intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. Sexual harassment may occur in  the workplace or in connection with work.   1.6 While typically involving a pattern of conduct, sexual harassment may take the  form of a single incident. In assessing the reasonableness of expectations or  perceptions, the perspective of the person who is the target of the conduct shall be  considered.  1.7 Sexual harassment is the manifestation of a culture of discrimination and  privilege based on unequal gender relations and other power dynamics. Sexual  harassment may involve any conduct of a verbal, non-verbal or physical nature,  including written and electronic communications. Sexual harassment may occur  between persons of the same or different genders, and individuals of any gender can  be either the affected individuals or the alleged offenders. Sexual harassment may  occur outside the workplace and outside working hours, including during official  travel or social functions related to work. Sexual harassment may be perpetrated by  any colleague, including a supervisor, a peer or a subordinate. An offender's status as  a supervisor or a senior official may be treated as an aggravating circumstance. Sexual  harassment is prohibited under staff rule 1.2 (f) and may also constitute sexual  exploitation or abuse under staff rule 1.2 (e).         Abuse of authority    1.8 Abuse of authority is the improper use of a position of influence, power or  authority against another person. This is particularly serious when a person uses their  influence, power or authority to improperly influence the career or employment  conditions of another, including, but not limited to, appointment, assignment, contract  renewal, performance evaluation, working conditions or promotion. Abuse of  authority may also include conduct that creates a hostile or offensive work  environment which includes, but is not limited to, the use of intimidation, threats,  blackmail or coercion. Discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment,  are particularly serious when accompanied by abuse of authority.         Affected individual    1.9 The affected individual is a person in the workplace or in connection with work  towards whom possible prohibited conduct is directed.        Offender/alleged offender    1.10 The offender is a person who has engaged in prohibited conduct.  1.11 The alleged offender is a person who is alleged to have engaged in prohibited  conduct.        Impacted individuals    1.12 Impacted individuals may include the affected individual, bystanders, including  witnesses to the possible prohibited conduct or to the impact on the affected    ST/SGB/2019/8    3/13  19-15446    individual, and any colleague who intervened in the situation involving possible  prohibited conduct.         Non-staff personnel    1.13 Non-staff personnel are those individuals performing services in a direct or  other agreed relationship with the Organization and other than through a letter of  appointment under the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, and  include, without limitation, United Nations Volunteers, individual consultants and  contractors, interns and persons providing services under arrangements with the  United Nations Office for Project Services.        Responsible official    1.14 The responsible official shall have the meaning specified in administrative  instruction ST/AI/2017/1 on unsatisfactory conduct, investigations and the  disciplinary process.        Head of entity    1.15 The head of entity is the head of a department or an office, including an office  away from Headquarters, the head of a special political or peacekeeping mission, the  head of a regional commission, a resident or regional coordinator or the head of any  other unit tasked with programmed activities to whom the Secretary-General has  delegated functions directly.        Conduct and discipline focal points    1.16 A conduct and discipline focal point is a staff member designated by a head of  entity to provide advice and support on matters relating to conduct and discipline,  including those under the present bulletin. A conduct and discipline focal point serves,  inter alia, as a contact point for both the affected individual and the alleged offender  throughout the handling of formal reports of possible prohibited conduct to provide  information on the process and relevant time frames.         ClearCheck    1.17 ClearCheck is a centralized job candidate screening application. It captures  information on sexual harassment offenders and alleged offenders that is provided by  the entities of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination.        Section 2      Scope of the policy    2.1 Reports of prohibited conduct in the workplace or in connection with work can  be submitted by any person and against any person, irrespective of whether such  persons have any contractual status with the Organization.  2.2 Staff members who are alleged to have committed prohibited conduct may be  subject to disciplinary or other administrative action in accordance with  ST/AI/2017/1.   2.3 Non-staff personnel who are alleged to have committed prohibited conduct may  be subject to action in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract  governing their services and of other applicable policies regarding non-staff  personnel, including possible referral to local authorities.   2.4 Action on the reports will depend on the status of the alleged offender.

Section 4      Early intervention and receipt and handling of informal reports of possible  prohibited conduct        Early direct action    4.1 Affected individuals may, on a voluntary basis, if they feel comfortable and safe  doing so, approach alleged offenders about instances of possible prohibited conduct  and ask for such conduct to stop, as the alleged offenders may not be aware of the  negative impact of the conduct on others. However, disparity in power or status, fear  of retaliation or the nature of the conduct may make direct confrontation difficult, and  there is therefore no requirement for such action to be taken.        Managerial intervention    4.2 Affected individuals who believe that they may have been subject to instances  of possible prohibited conduct may raise the matter with their supervisors or other  senior officials if the situation allows and they feel comfortable doing so. Any  supervisor approached by an affected individual shall inform that person that  information about the options available to that person to address possible prohibited  conduct may be obtained from the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and  Mediation Services or from the Staff Counsellor on a confidential basis and that  advice may be obtained from the conduct and discipline focal point. Anonymous and  confidential advice about possible sexual harassment may also be obtained from the  ""Speak up"" helpline. 1  The supervisor approached shall keep a record of such  communication.  4.3 Supervisors shall provide assistance and/or information in a timely, sensitive  and impartial manner to an affected individual, in accordance with the provisions of  the present bulletin. To address the matter promptly at the managerial level,  supervisors may:    (a)  With the consent of the affected individual, bring the matter to the  attention of the alleged offender, who may be required to undergo training and/or  coaching, as available, to prevent reoccurrence of the possible prohibited conduct;    (b)  Agree with all concerned on other approaches to address the issues raised,  including, after consulting the head of entity, the actions referred to in sections 6.10 (a)  to (g) below;     (c)  With the consent of the affected individual, facilitate a discussion among  the impacted individuals and the alleged offender about the conduct in question. The  __________________    1  The helpline can be reached at 1 917 367 8910 or, from peacekeeping missions, at 1212 78910.  When dialling internally from United Nations duty stations in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Beirut,  Geneva, Nairobi, New York, Santiago and Vienna, the extension is 78910. The helpline can also  be reached at speakup@un.org.     ST/SGB/2019/8    7/13  19-15446    Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services may be asked to  facilitate such a discussion.   4.4 Supervisors shall submit a record regarding any managerial intervention carried  out to the responsible official. Such intervention does not preclude the matter from  being formally reported.   4.5 Any supervisor who has been informed about instances of possible prohibited  conduct shall provide timely and sensitive support to an affected individual.  Supervisors can seek advice on how to provide such support from the Staff  Counsellor. If a supervisor cannot perform this role for any reason, the affected  individual shall be referred to the Staff Counsellor for psychosocial and/or emotional  support from a mental health professional.  4.6 Supervisors shall provide an affected individual with a copy of the present  bulletin and are encouraged to refer to guidance material on addressing possible  prohibited conduct available on iSeek in the Human Resources Handbook, and the  United Nations regulatory framework policy portal, when operational.         Confidential support    4.7 Affected individuals may prefer and are encouraged to discuss their situation  with the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services and/or the  Staff Counsellor, as follows:    (a)  The services of the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and  Mediation Services include discussing options and referrals according to the wishes  of the affected individuals. Nothing is triggered automatically by contacting the  Office. The contact itself is ""off the record"". Affected individuals visiting the Office  therefore remain in control of any decisions they may wish to make following such a  visit to discuss options;     (b)  Staff Counsellors are mental health professionals who may provide  psychosocial support and discuss tools to address the emotional impact that the  situation has on the affected individual, as well as guidance on potential referral to  external mental health resources, if needed.   4.8 Consultations with officials from the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman  and Mediation Services or with the Staff Counsellor may be held in person or through  electronic means, depending on available resources and the location of the affected  individual.  4.9 Both the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services and  the Staff Counsellor are bound by strict rules of confidentiality under their respective  terms of reference. Any discussion with them is strictly confidential. Documentation  and other information may not be shared with any other office without the consent of  the affected individual or other person seeking support.         Informal resolution    4.10 Affected individuals may, on a voluntary basis, attempt to address a situation of  possible prohibited conduct in an informal manner, including with the assistance of  the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services, whose services  may include one-on-one conflict coaching to be able to give voice to concerns  effectively, shuttle diplomacy to communicate with others through an intermediary  without having to be in the same physical space, and facilitated discussions or  mediation. All services of the Office are tailored to the specific circumstances of the  case, and nothing is done without agreement.  ST/SGB/2019/8      19-15446  8/13    4.11 An unsuccessful attempt to resolve the matter informally does not preclude it  from being formally reported.        Section 5      Receipt and handling of formal reports of possible prohibited conduct    5.1 Formal reports of possible prohibited conduct may be made by persons who  consider that they are the affected individuals or by persons who have knowledge of  possible prohibited conduct.   5.2 A formal report of possible prohibited conduct should contain sufficient detail  for it to be assessed, such as:     (a)  A detailed description of the prohibited conduct;    (b)  The name of the alleged offender;    (c)  The name of the alleged affected individual, if the report is made by a third  party;    (d)  Where and when the prohibited conduct occurred;    (e)  The names of potential witnesses to the prohibited conduct;    (f)  All available supporting documentation.  5.3 Formal reports may be made anonymously and are not subject to time limits.  However, the anonymity of reports of possible prohibited conduct and the passage of  time may render the initiation or completion of an investigation or disciplinary  process more difficult.   5.4 Possible prohibited conduct shall be reported in accordance with section 4 of  ST/AI/2017/1 either to the responsible official, with a copy to the Office of Internal  Oversight Services (OIOS), or to OIOS. If a report of possible prohibited conduct is  made to the responsible official, the responsible official shall forward the report of  possible prohibited conduct to OIOS and acknowledge receipt of the report.   5.5 The preliminary assessment of a report of possible prohibited conduct,  investigations of possible prohibited conduct and action taken subsequent to an  investigation shall accord with the procedures set out in sections 5 to 12 of  ST/AI/2017/1 and with the following additional requirements:    (a)  The receipt of a formal report of possible prohibited conduct, if not  submitted anonymously, shall be acknowledged by OIOS;    (b)  The person formally reporting possible prohibited conduct shall be  informed of the Organization's policy on protection against retaliation for reporting  misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits or investigations (see  ST/SGB/2017/2/Rev.1);    (c)  Where a formal report of possible sexual harassment is submitted by a  person other than the affected individual, OIOS shall normally seek the views of the  affected individual before deciding whether to proceed with an investigation;    (d)  If OIOS decides to investigate a formal report of possible prohibited  conduct, notice of the initiation of the investigation shall normally be provided to the  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources and to the head of entity  concerned, unless the head of entity is an alleged offender or is otherwise implicated  in the matter;    (e)  If OIOS refers a report of possible prohibited conduct to a responsible  official for action pursuant to section 5.3 of ST/AI/2017/1, OIOS shall also copy the  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources on such referral and inform the    ST/SGB/2019/8    9/13  19-15446    affected individual if the report of possible prohibited conduct was not submitted  anonymously. The responsible official shall normally make the determination  pursuant to section 5.6 of ST/AI/2017/1 within three months of receipt of the report  from OIOS and shall inform OIOS and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human  Resources of the decision, including, if an investigative panel is constituted, the  identity of the panel members;    (f)  If the responsible official decides to initiate an investigation pursuant to  section 5.6 (a) of ST/AI/2017/1, the responsible official must constitute an  investigative panel to undertake the investigation within one month of the decision.  Any such investigative panel shall be made up of individuals who have attended one  of the periodic trainings concerning prohibited conduct investigations provided by  OIOS and the Office of Human Resources and who have been placed on the roster of  investigators maintained by the Office of Human Resources. Any cost associated with  an investigation undertaken by a panel shall be borne by the entity of the responsible  official. The Office of Human Resources shall maintain a roster of persons trained to  conduct an investigation into possible prohibited conduct;    (g)  In respect of a report of possible prohibited conduct investigated by OIOS,  OIOS would normally inform the affected individual and the alleged offender, as  appropriate, at least every three months of the status of the investigation.

This obligation also  applies when a matter has been referred by OIOS to the Office of Human Resources  and the responsible official has been informed in accordance with section 5.5 (e)  above. Conduct and discipline focal points, at the request of an affected individual or  alleged offender, shall respond, without undue delay, but normally within two weeks,  to queries relating to the handling of the formal report of possible prohibited conduct;    (i)  The affected individual and the alleged offender shall be informed on a  strictly confidential basis of the outcome of the matter, as follows:     (i)  By OIOS, if the matter is closed by OIOS pursuant to section 7.1 of  ST/AI/2017/1, with a copy to the head of entity of the affected individual and  alleged offender and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources;     (ii) By the responsible official, if the matter is closed with no action by the  responsible official pursuant to sections 7.4 or 7.5 (a) of ST/AI/2017/1 or  following a referral from the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  pursuant to section 8.2 (b) of ST/AI/2017/1, or if the responsible official has  taken managerial or administrative measures pursuant to section 7.5 (b) of  ST/AI/2017/1 or following a referral from the Assistant Secretary-General for  Human Resources pursuant to section 8.2 (b) of ST/AI/2017/1, with a copy to  the head of entity of the affected individual and alleged offender and to OIOS  and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources;    (iii) By the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources, if the matter has  been referred to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources pursuant  to sections 7.2 or 7.6 of ST/AI/2017/1, with a copy to the head of entity of the  affected individual and alleged offender and to OIOS;  ST/SGB/2019/8      19-15446  10/13      (j)  At the request of the affected individual or the offender or alleged offender,  the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources may provide a statement on the  outcome of the matter, which the affected individual or the offender or alleged  offender may disclose to third parties, subject to staff regulation 1.2 (i).

Possible criminal conduct may also be reported directly to national  authorities by an affected individual.         Section 6      Support        Confidential guidance and support     6.1 The Organization has set up the ""Speak up"" helpline1 to provide information on  options for addressing possible prohibited conduct and the support available to  affected individuals.

However, continuous periods of special leave without pay  exceeding 30 calendar days will not be counted towards the five-year requirement.  2.15 Any resignation, even if followed by an appointment the following day, is a  separation initiated by the staff member which brings about an end to all contractual  arrangements. Unless reinstated under staff rule 4.18, a resignation is deemed to be  a break in continuity of service under staff rule 4.17.   2.16 Service in any entity governed by the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations, including service on secondment, will count towards the five years of  qualifying service, provided that such service was continuous until the eligibility date.   2.17 Service in entities of the United Nations common system not governed by the  Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations will not be counted towards  qualifying service. However, service in those entities does count for the purpose of  calculating points in accordance with the mechanisms outlined in section 3 of the  present instruction, provided that such service has been continuous until the  eligibility date.  2.18 Service as an Associate Expert is not counted towards qualifying service.

Performance rating     3.9 In order to be allocated points on the basis of performance ratings, the staff  member's four most recent performance reports will be considered. Any individual  report covering one year or more with a rating of ""Exceeds expectations""3 or its  equivalent will be allocated points accordingly. No points will be allocated for  performance reports covering a period of less than one year.        Service in hardship duty stations     3.10 Points are allocated when a staff member has served at least one year  continuously in the same duty station/mission with a hardship classification of A, B,  C, D or E.

ST/AI/2012/3      12-46235  6    3.11 Temporary assignments of less than one year in different duty stations cannot  be accumulated to total one year for the purpose of allocating points. Temporary  assignments that are extended to one continuous year or more in the same duty  station shall be considered a full tour of duty for such a purpose.  3.12 When the hardship classification of a duty station changes during a staff  member's tour of duty at that location, the highest hardship classification shall be  recognized for the purpose of allocating points.        Service in non-family duty station     3.13 A staff member will be allocated points for serving for at least one year  continuously in a non-family duty station. No points will be allocated if the  assignment duration was less than one year.

The Office of Human Resources Management will issue an  information circular advising staff members that there will be no review exercise  that year;    (c)  When the cumulative number of staff members with a permanent or  continuing appointment is lower than the established level of the relevant post  envelope in any year, the Office of Human Resources Management shall announce  to staff members the number of continuing appointments available in that given  year, in accordance with section 5.1 of ST/SGB/2011/9;    (d)  The Office of Human Resources Management shall issue a preliminary  list of potentially eligible candidates per department or office based on a prima facie  review of appointment records for the five years preceding the eligibility date and  shall communicate the list to each department or office for verification and  amendment, if applicable, in accordance with section 5.2 of ST/SGB/2011/9;    (e)  Each head of department or office shall review the eligibility and points  allocation of the staff members serving within his or her department or office at the  time of review. A staff member who is on temporary assignment to an office in the  Secretariat other than his or her parent office at the eligibility date will be  considered by his or her parent department or office, in consultation with the office  where the staff member currently serves, as appropriate;    (f)  Each head of department or office shall communicate to the Office of  Human Resources Management the final list of eligible staff members and the points  allocated to each staff member under their purview. In the event that the number of  continuing appointments to be awarded under a given post envelope is larger than  the number of eligible staff members in that envelope, all eligible candidates will be  awarded  continuing  appointments,  in  accordance  with  section  5.3  of  ST/SGB/2011/9;    (g)  Decisions on both eligibility for the consideration for the granting of a  continuing appointment and the points allocated will be communicated by the head  of department or office to the staff member concerned once confirmed by the  departments/offices;  ST/AI/2012/3      12-46235  8      (h)  The Office of Human Resources Management shall then centralize the  information received and create two lists of eligible staff members in ranked order  based on the allocation of points. One list shall be for the Professional and higher  categories and for the Field Service category and the other for the General Service  and related categories, in accordance with section 5.3 of ST/SGB/2011/9;    (i)  As the review is conducted on a global basis, there shall be no relation  between the number of posts in the envelope per department or office and the  number of staff members who could be granted a continuing appointment in that  same department or office;    (j)  Staff members who are awarded an equal number of points shall be  ranked on the basis of length of continuous service;    (k)  In order to be granted a continuing appointment, staff members shall  meet the criteria listed under section 2.1 (b), (e) and (f) of ST/SGB/2011/9 at the  time of the granting of the appointment;    (l)  If a decision is made not to renew the fixed-term appointment of a staff  member, and the fixed-term appointment expires during the review period, the staff  member's fixed-term appointment will not be extended to cover the full duration of  the review period. The staff member's fixed-term appointment shall end on the  expiration date of his or her appointment;    (m) Staff members that meet the eligibility criteria at the start of the review  period and are thereafter seconded to another United Nations organization, placed  on special leave without pay for any duration or separated from the Organization  during the review period shall be withdrawn from the review. Eligible staff members  on secondment to another United Nations organization or placed on special leave  who are withdrawn from the review may be considered in future reviews under the  provisions of section 2.7 above;    (n)  The granting of continuing appointments based on the ranking as  determined by the number of points received shall be effective as of the date on  which the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management certifies  the final global ranking and confirms that the successful candidates continue to meet  the criteria for granting of continuing appointments, in accordance with section 5.4  and 5.6 of ST/SGB/2011/9;    (o)  Staff members who have met the eligibility requirements listed in section  2 of ST/SGB/2011/9 but not granted a continuing appointment owing to the level of  the relevant post envelope will have to satisfy those eligibility requirements again in  future years, once they are eligible for consideration for the granting of a continuing  appointment in the relevant post envelope (see section 5.5 of ST/SGB/2011/9). In  such cases, the department will update the information related to new periods of  service for the purposes of eligibility and points allocation.

Travel of a candidate or staff member to the duty  station or reporting for duty, prior to the authorized date, does not advance the entry  on duty date.  3.8 Pursuant to staff rule 4.17, a former staff member may be re-employed.   3.9 A former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment following his or  her separation from service for any of the following reasons:    (a)  Abandonment of post;    (b)  Misconduct;    (c)  Termination or non-renewal of appointment for unsatisfactory service;    (d)  Resignation during an investigation of misconduct or institution of a  disciplinary process, unless the former staff member agrees to cooperate with an  ongoing investigation or disciplinary process until its conclusion.  3.10 Upon separation from service following resignation from a fixed-term  appointment, a former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment for a  period of 31 days following the separation.   3.11 A staff member serving under a fixed-term appointment in the General Service  category who applies in response to a regular and not temporary vacancy  announcement, and who is selected and offered a Field Service or National  Professional Officer position following a competitive process, must resign from his  or her current position and separate from the Organization.

There is  no limitation to the number of times an appointment may be renewed consecutively,  subject to the needs of the Organization.   4.3 A fixed-term appointment may be renewed for any period of up to five years at  a time, provided that on the date of renewal the staff member:    (a)  Has served a minimum of five years of continuous service1 under fixed- term appointments governed by the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations;    (b)  Continues to hold a fixed-term appointment and was selected through a  competitive process that included a review by a Secretariat review body;2    (c)  Has received a performance rating of at least ""Meets expectations"" or the  equivalent in his/her appraisal reports of the last five years;    (d)  Has not availed of special leave without pay for more than six cumulative  months within the last five years;     (e)  Has not separated from the Organization and received payment on  account of termination indemnity, repatriation grant or commutation of accrued  annual leave within the last five years.   4.4 A proposed renewal of appointment shall not create any obligations on behalf of  the Organization if it is not accepted by the staff member on a timely basis, or the staff  member. The Organization initiates a renewal of appointment by issuing a letter of  renewal indicating the new expiration date and change of department, office or duty  station, if any.

Extension of fixed-term appointments for utilization of maternity and paternity leave    4.5 The fact that a staff member is or will be on maternity or paternity leave shall  not be a factor in considering renewal of appointment.  4.6 If, however, on the basis of considerations unrelated to the staff member's  pregnancy, a decision is made not to renew a fixed-term appointment and the current  appointment is due to expire during the period of maternity leave, the appointment  will be extended to cover the full duration of the leave. This provision shall not  apply in cases where the fixed-term appointment expires more than six weeks before  the anticipated date of delivery.  4.7 If, however, on the basis of considerations unrelated to the staff member's  decision to take paternity leave, a decision is made not to renew a fixed-term  appointment and the current appointment is due to expire during the first eight  weeks following the birth of the child, the appointment will be extended to cover the  full duration of the leave taken in one continuous period.   __________________    1  Time served as an Associate Expert is not counted towards the five years of continuous service.    2  A review by a Secretariat body is not required for staff in the PIA I to PIA II, TC-1 to TC-3, S-1  and S-2, and GS-1 to GS-4 levels.    ST/AI/2013/1   5  13-30419    4.8 When an appointment is extended solely to enable a staff member to utilize the  maternity or paternity leave entitlement under sections 4.6 and 4.7 above, such  extension shall not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, annual  leave, sick leave or home leave, although credit towards repatriation grant may  continue to accrue if the staff member has not returned to his or her home country.  In the event of death during the period of the extension, the period prior to the staff  member's death may be taken into account in the determination of the death benefit  provided under staff rule 9.11.        Extension of fixed-term appointments for utilization of sick leave     4.9 When a staff member on a fixed-term appointment is incapacitated for service  by reason of an illness that continues beyond the date of expiration of the  appointment, he or she shall be granted an extension of the appointment, after  consultation with the Medical Director or designated medical officer, for the  continuous period of certified illness up to the maximum entitlement to sick leave at  full pay and half pay under staff rule 6.2.     (a)  The maximum entitlement shall be determined by the nature of the staff  member's appointment and length of continuous service;     (b)  When the staff member is being considered for a disability benefit, and  paid leave entitlements have been exhausted because of a delay in the medical  determination of the staff member's incapacity for further service or in the decision  by the United Nations Staff Pension Committee as to whether to award a disability  benefit, the staff member shall be placed on special leave with half pay until the  date of such decision.  4.10 When a staff member's fixed-term appointment is extended solely to enable  him or her to utilize his or her sick leave under section 4.9 above, such extension shall  not give rise to any further entitlement to salary increment, annual leave, sick leave,  maternity leave, paternity leave or home leave, although credit towards repatriation  grant may continue to accrue if the staff member has not returned to his or her home  country. Sick leave on half pay during the period of extension may not be  supplemented by annual leave. In the event of death during the period of extension,  the period prior to the death may be taken into account in the determination of the  death benefit provided in staff rule 9.11.        Extension of fixed-term appointments for completion of performance  improvement plan    4.11 Should unsatisfactory performance be the basis for a decision for a non-renewal  of a fixed-term appointment and should the appointment expire before the end of the  period covering a time-bound performance improvement plan, the appointment  should be renewed for the duration necessary for the completion of the performance  improvement plan.  4.12 Should unsatisfactory performance be the basis for a decision of non-renewal  of an appointment and should the appointment expire before the end of a rebuttal  process initiated by a staff member, the appointment should be renewed for the  duration necessary for the completion of the rebuttal process.

Section 2       Use and duration of fixed-term appointments    2.1 A fixed-term appointment may be granted to enable the employment of staff  for defined periods of time, subject to the needs of the Organization, such as:     (a)  To work on activities with a finite mandate of one year or more;     (b)  To perform functions of medium-term duration, which could continue for  a number of years;    (c)  To perform functions that are part of the Organization's regular and  continuing activities.   2.2 Pursuant to staff rule 4.13 (a), a fixed-term appointment may be granted for a  period of one year or more, up to five years at a time, to individuals recruited for  service of a prescribed duration having an expiration date specified in the letter of  appointment. This includes individuals:   ST/AI/2013/1      13-30419  2      (a)  Selected but not reviewed by a Secretariat review body for positions at  the Public Information Assistant PIA I to PIA II, Trade and Crafts TC-1 to TC-3,  Security Service S-1 and S-2, and General Service GS-1 to GS-4 levels;     (b)  Selected but not reviewed by a Secretariat review body for appointments  limited to specific entities;    (c)  Selected through a competitive process that includes a review by a  Secretariat review body under staff rule 4.15;    (d)  Selected through a competitive examination under staff rule 4.16;     (e)  Selected in accordance with section 2.2 (c) above and temporarily  seconded by national Governments or institutions for service with the United  Nations;    (f)  Selected at the Assistant Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General  levels by the Secretary-General.

Such individuals  shall be granted a fixed-term appointment if engaged for a period of one year or  more as specified in their letter of appointment. Individuals selected for temporary  vacancies shall be granted a temporary appointment.   3.5 The place of recruitment for staff selected for posts subject to international  recruitment is the location of the individual's most recent residence at the time the  offer of appointment is sent and/or pre-recruitment formalities finalized, irrespective  of the staff member's country of nationality recognized by the Secretary-General,  place of home leave or where the individual is a permanent resident. In exceptional  circumstances, a change in the place of recruitment may be authorized.    ST/AI/2013/1    3  13-30419    3.6 The place of recruitment for staff selected for posts subject to local  recruitment shall be in the country or within commuting distance of the duty station.   3.7 The appointment of a staff member takes effect from the date on which the  individual is duly authorized to enter into official travel status to assume his or her  duties, or, if no official travel is involved, from the duly authorized date on which  the staff member reports for duty. Travel of a candidate or staff member to the duty  station or reporting for duty, prior to the authorized date, does not advance the entry  on duty date.  3.8 Pursuant to staff rule 4.17, a former staff member may be re-employed.   3.9 A former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment following his or  her separation from service for any of the following reasons:    (a)  Abandonment of post;    (b)  Misconduct;    (c)  Termination or non-renewal of appointment for unsatisfactory service;    (d)  Resignation during an investigation of misconduct or institution of a  disciplinary process, unless the former staff member agrees to cooperate with an  ongoing investigation or disciplinary process until its conclusion.  3.10 Upon separation from service following resignation from a fixed-term  appointment, a former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment for a  period of 31 days following the separation.   3.11 A staff member serving under a fixed-term appointment in the General Service  category who applies in response to a regular and not temporary vacancy  announcement, and who is selected and offered a Field Service or National  Professional Officer position following a competitive process, must resign from his  or her current position and separate from the Organization. The individual may then  be re-employed no earlier than seven days following the separation.   3.12 In the case of separation following a mutually agreed termination of  appointment, unless otherwise specified in the agreement, a former United Nations  common system staff member will be ineligible for re-employment for a period of  three years following the separation.  3.13 In the case of separation from service on retirement, a former staff member  will be ineligible for re-employment on a fixed term appointment.  3.14 A former staff member who is re-employed under staff rule 4.17 shall be given  a new appointment unless he or she is reinstated under staff rule 4.18.

Accordingly, under no circumstances may a  staff member who has separated from service carry over any accrued annual leave to  a new appointment upon re-employment.        Section 4       Renewal and extension of fixed-term appointments     4.1 Subject to the needs of the Organization, a fixed-term appointment may be  renewed for any period up to five years under the conditions described in  ST/AI/2013/1      13-30419  4    paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3 below.

In the event of death during the period of the extension, the period prior to the staff  member's death may be taken into account in the determination of the death benefit  provided under staff rule 9.11.

Sick leave on half pay during the period of extension may not be  supplemented by annual leave. In the event of death during the period of extension,  the period prior to the death may be taken into account in the determination of the  death benefit provided in staff rule 9.11.        Extension of fixed-term appointments for completion of performance  improvement plan    4.11 Should unsatisfactory performance be the basis for a decision for a non-renewal  of a fixed-term appointment and should the appointment expire before the end of the  period covering a time-bound performance improvement plan, the appointment  should be renewed for the duration necessary for the completion of the performance  improvement plan.

"human resources","  United Nations    ST/AI/2007/3       Secretariat      1 July 2007      07-43395 (E)    240707      *0743395*     Administrative instruction         After-service health insurance        The Under-Secretary-General for Management, pursuant to section 4.2 of  Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/1997/1 and for the purpose of implementing  General Assembly resolution 61/264, hereby promulgates the following.        Section 1  After-service health insurance coverage    1.1 The purpose of the present administrative instruction is to set out provisions  governing the after-service health insurance programme effective 1 July 2007.  1.2 After-service health insurance coverage is optional for eligible former staff  members and their dependants. It is available only as a continuation, without  interruption between active service and retirement status, of previous active-service  coverage in a contributory health insurance plan of the United Nations. In this  context, a contributory health insurance plan of the United Nations is defined to  include a contributory health insurance plan of other organizations in the common  system under which staff members may be covered by special arrangement between  the United Nations and those organizations.        Section 2  Eligibility for after-service health insurance coverage    2.1 Individuals in the following categories are eligible to enrol in the after-service  health insurance programme:    (a)  A 100 series or 200 series staff member who was recruited on or after  1 July 2007, who while a contributing participant in a United Nations contributory  health insurance plan as defined in section 1.2 above, was separated from service,  other than by summary dismissal:    (i)  At any age with a disability benefit under the Regulations of the United  Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) or with compensation for  disability under appendix D to the Staff Rules; or    (ii) At 55 years of age or later, provided that he or she had been a participant  in a contributory health insurance plan of the United Nations for a minimum  of ten years and is eligible and elects to receive a retirement, early retirement  or deferred retirement benefit under the Regulations of UNJSPF;  ST/AI/2007/3      07-43395  2      (b)  A 100 series or 200 series staff member who was recruited before  1 July 2007, who while a contributing participant in a United Nations contributory  health insurance plan as defined in section 1.2 above, was separated from service,  other than by summary dismissal:    (i)  At any age with a disability benefit under the Regulations of UNJSPF or  with compensation for disability under appendix D to the Staff Rules; or    (ii) At 55 years of age or later, provided that he or she had been a participant  in a contributory health insurance plan of the United Nations for a minimum  of five years and is eligible and elects to receive a retirement, early retirement  or deferred retirement benefit under the Regulations of UNJSPF;    (c)  The surviving spouse (as recognized by the United Nations) of:    (i)  A staff member who died in service while participating in a United  Nations contributory health insurance plan; or    (ii) A former staff member who died while participating in the after-service  health insurance programme;  provided that the surviving spouse was participating in the same health insurance  plan at the time of death of the staff member or former staff member, and is eligible  for a periodic benefit awarded under the Regulations of UNJSPF or appendix D to  the Staff Rules, or both;    (d)  Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5 below, the surviving  dependent children of:    (i)  A staff member who died in service, without leaving a surviving spouse  (as recognized by the United Nations), while participating in a United Nations  contributory health insurance plan; or    (ii) A former staff member who died while participating in the after-service  health insurance programme without leaving a surviving spouse (as recognized  by the United Nations); or    (iii) A surviving spouse as described in paragraph 2.1 (c) above who died  while participating in the after-service health insurance programme;  provided that the dependent child was participating in the same health insurance  plan at the time of death of the staff member or former staff member or surviving  spouse, and is eligible for a periodic benefit awarded under the Regulations of  UNJSPF or appendix D to the Staff Rules, or both.  2.2 For the purpose of determining eligibility in accordance with paragraph 2.1  above and cost sharing in accordance with paragraph 3.2 (b) below, participation in  a contributory health insurance plan of the United Nations is defined to include:    (a)  Participation in a contributory health insurance plan of other  organizations in the common system under which staff members may be covered by  special arrangement between the United Nations and those organizations;    (b)  The cumulative contributory participation during all periods of service  under 100 or 200 series appointments, continuous or otherwise. Except in cases of  extension of appointment beyond the normal age of retirement, only participation in  a United Nations health insurance plan prior to the attainment of the normal age of    ST/AI/2007/3   3  07-43395    retirement shall count towards meeting the five- or ten-year participation  requirement for enrolment.  2.3 At the time of enrolment for after-service health insurance coverage the  eligible subscriber may elect coverage for himself or herself and may also elect to  include coverage for his or her spouse (as recognized by the United Nations) and/or  eligible dependent children as defined in paragraph 2.4 below subject to the  following requirements:    (a)  A 100 or 200 series staff member who was recruited on or after 1 July  2007 and meets the eligibility criteria noted in paragraph 2.1 (a) (i) or 2.1 (a) (ii)  above may elect to include coverage for his or her spouse and eligible dependent  children who were enrolled in the same contributory health insurance plan as the  former staff member for a minimum of five years (or two years if the spouse had  coverage with an outside employer or a national Government) and was so enrolled  at the time of the former staff member's separation from service. However, in the  case of a spouse or dependants newly acquired five or fewer years prior to the staff  member's separation from employment, the two- and five-year participation  requirements will not apply provided such spouse or dependant(s) is/are enrolled  within 30 days of the effective date of the dependency relationship;    (b)  A 100 or 200 series staff member who was recruited before 1 July 2007  and meets the eligibility criteria noted in paragraph 2.1 (b) (i) or 2.1 (b) (ii) above  may elect to include coverage for his or her spouse and eligible dependent children  who were enrolled in the same contributory health insurance plan as the former staff  member at the time of the former staff member's separation from service;    (c)  A surviving spouse who meets the eligibility criteria noted in 2.1 (c) may  elect to include coverage for his or her eligible dependent children who were  enrolled in the same contributory health insurance plan as the former staff member  at the time of the former staff member's death.  2.4 An eligible dependent child is defined as a natural or legally adopted child or  stepchild, recognized by the United Nations, existing on the date of separation or  death in service of the former staff member. In addition, a former staff member's  natural child who was born within 300 days of the staff member's separation from  service or death is also an eligible dependent child who may be included in  coverage, provided such child is enrolled within 30 days of birth and is eligible for a  periodic benefit awarded under the Regulations of UNJSPF or appendix D to the  Staff Rules, or both.  2.5 Except in cases in which both the former staff member and the surviving  spouse are deceased, dependent children may be covered under the after-service  health insurance programme until the end of the calendar year in which they reach  25 years of age, provided that they are not married or in full-time employment.  Disabled children may be eligible for continued coverage after the age of 25  provided they continue to be eligible for a periodic benefit awarded under the  Regulations of UNJSPF or appendix D to the Staff Rules, or both. Where the former  staff member and surviving spouse are both deceased, the surviving children will no  longer be eligible to participate in the after-service health insurance programme  upon cessation of the periodic benefit awarded under the Regulations of UNJSPF  and/or appendix D to the Staff Rules, normally when they have attained 21 years of  age.  ST/AI/2007/3      07-43395  4        Section 3  Contributions to the cost of after-service health insurance    3.1 The cost of participating in a United Nations after-service health insurance  plan for staff recruited on or after 1 July 2007 shall be governed by the following  conditions:    (a)  The cost of participation under the provisions of paragraphs 2.1 (a) (i)  and 2.1 (a) (ii) above shall be borne on the basis of joint contributions by the United  Nations and the participants concerned;    (b)  Joint contributions by the United Nations and the after-service health  insurance participants, as indicated in paragraph 3.1 (a) above, shall be computed in  accordance with the established contribution and subsidy scales for the particular  health insurance plan concerned. Contributions shall be calculated on the basis of  the higher of the following two rates:    (i)  The total of all the periodic benefits payable on the staff member's  account under the Regulations of UNJSPF or under appendix D to the Staff  Rules, or both, including all cost-of-living increases provided thereon, whether  or not part of such benefits has been commuted to a lump sum or reduced by  the exercise of any other permissible option, including early retirement; or    (ii) The theoretical periodic benefit that would have been payable on the staff  member's account under the Regulations of UNJSPF had the staff member  completed 25 years of contributory service.  3.2 The cost of participating in a United Nations after-service health insurance  plan for staff recruited before 1 July 2007 shall be governed by the following  conditions:    (a)  The cost of participation under the provisions of 2.1 (b) (i) shall be borne  on the basis of joint contributions by the United Nations and the participants  concerned;    (b)  The cost of participation under the provisions of 2.1 (b) (ii) shall be  borne on the basis of joint contributions by the United Nations and the participants  concerned provided that the former staff member had participated in a contributory  health insurance plan of the United Nations for a total period of contributory  participation of at least 10 years;    (c)  The cost of participation under the provisions of 2.1 (b) (ii) for former  staff not meeting the conditions in 3.2 (b) above shall be borne in full by the  participants concerned. When the concerned participants' combined active service  and after-service participation totals 10 years, the cost will be borne jointly by the  United Nations and the participants concerned;    (d)  Joint contributions by the United Nations and the after-service health  insurance participants, as indicated in paragraphs 3.2 (a) through (c) above, shall be  computed in accordance with the established contribution and subsidy scales for the  particular health insurance plan concerned. Contributions shall be calculated on the  basis of the higher of the following two rates:    (i)  One third of the remuneration used for calculating the health insurance  subsidy of the staff member concerned at the date of separation; or    ST/AI/2007/3   5  07-43395      (ii) The total of all the periodic benefits payable on the staff member's  account under the Regulations of UNJSPF or under appendix D to the Staff  Rules, or both, including all cost-of-living increases provided thereon, whether  or not part of such benefits has been commuted to a lump sum or reduced by  the exercise of any other permissible option, including early retirement.  3.3 The cost of participation in an after-service health insurance plan for those  individuals eligible under paragraphs 2.1 (c) and 2.1 (d) will be determined on the  same basis as would have been used for participation by the former staff member  concerned, taking into account the deceased staff member's recruitment date and the  length of his or her participation in a United Nations health insurance plan as a staff  member and as a participant in an after-service health insurance plan.        Section 4  Payment of contributions to the cost of after-service health insurance coverage    4.1 Subscribers covered under the after-service health insurance programme shall  have their contributions deducted on a monthly basis from their periodic pension  and/or appendix D benefit. Authorization permitting UNJSPF to effect such monthly  deduction from the periodic pension benefit is an integral application component for  after-service coverage, and is executed as part of the application process for the  after-service health insurance programme (see also section 7 below).  4.2 In the case of subscribers to the after-service health insurance programme  (a) who elect to defer pension payments, or (b) who receive monthly pension benefit  payments that are insufficient to meet the cost of the participant's monthly health  insurance coverage, or (c) where automatic deductions from periodic pension  payments payable from UNJSPF or appendix D are not available, payment of the  requisite contribution must be made in advance of the period of coverage under the  applicable health insurance plan on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis.  Contributions must be made in a currency acceptable to the Organization for the  purposes of the insurance plan chosen. In the case of health insurance plans  administered at Headquarters, the only acceptable currency is the United States  dollar.  4.3 After-service health insurance participants whose premium contributions are  payable on the basis of an invoice, rather than through the automatic pension  deduction mechanism, must remit full payment of the amount billed by the due date  indicated on the invoice. Failure to remit the premium in full by the date indicated  will result in suspension of insurance coverage, without further notice. Insurance  coverage may be reinstated provided that the full required premium payment is  remitted within three months of the date of suspension of coverage, along with  payment for any subsequent period that may have become due. Failure to reinstate  coverage by the latter date will result in termination of eligibility to participate in  the after-service health insurance programme.  4.4 On occasion, a delay may occur in the process of completing the after-service  health insurance enrolment requirements, as the separated staff member must be  recorded in the Pension Fund, and the separation personnel action form must be  furnished to the Health and Life Insurance Section at Headquarters or the local  human resources office or other office responsible for administering health plan  enrolments before enrolment in the after-service health insurance programme is  completed. When such delay occurs, participation in the after-service health  ST/AI/2007/3      07-43395  6    insurance programme shall commence retroactively on the first day of the month  following cessation of in-service coverage. In such cases, the after-service health  insurance contribution accrual will be deducted from the participant's pension  payments until fully recovered or will be billed to the participant if deductions from  pension are not possible.        Section 5  Cessation of coverage    5.1 Eligibility for after-service health insurance coverage shall cease:    (a)  When enrolment is terminated under the conditions set out in paragraph  4.3 above;    (b)  When the periodic disability or compensation benefits awarded to a  former staff member are formally discontinued;    (c)  When the former staff member re-enters the United Nations Joint Staff  Pension Fund as a participant following re-employment. In this case, participation in  after-service coverage will be suspended and the staff member will contribute to the  health insurance plan as an active participant. After-service health insurance  coverage will resume upon separation from service and reapplication within  31 days of such separation;    (d)  Upon divorce of a United Nations-recognized covered spouse who is not  a current or former staff member;    (e)  Upon the remarriage of a surviving spouse who is otherwise eligible for  after-service health insurance coverage;    (f)  Except in the case of a disabled child, when a covered child no longer  qualifies as a result of attaining age 25, legal emancipation, marriage, full-time  employment or cessation of a pension or compensation benefit, whichever comes  first;    (g)  When a covered disabled child no longer qualifies as a result of  emancipation, marriage, full-time employment or cessation of a pension or  compensation benefit, whichever comes first.  5.2 After-service health insurance participants are responsible for informing the  office administering their insurance plan within three months of the event whenever  a covered family member ceases to be eligible for participation in the after-service  health insurance programme, in the event of the death of any covered participant, by  virtue of divorce in the case of a spouse, or the marriage, full-time employment or  attainment of 25 years of age in the case of a dependent child. No retroactive  adjustments in the insurance contribution amount will be made to the participant as  a result of failure to provide timely notification of any change in the status of  covered family members to the administering office concerned. Irrespective of when  notification is given, no coverage will be provided after a family member ceases to  be eligible for participation in the after-service health insurance programme.  5.3 A participant in the after-service health insurance programme who chooses to  cancel his or her coverage must provide written notice of the intention to cancel  coverage to the office administering his or her United Nations health insurance plan.  Cancellation of coverage will be made effective on the first day of the second month    ST/AI/2007/3   7  07-43395    following receipt of the written notification or such later date as may be required  under local medical insurance schemes. Notwithstanding such notification of  cancellation of coverage, the after-service health insurance participant will be  responsible to remit promptly to the United Nations any contribution amounts which  may be unpaid at the time of cancellation of coverage. If the contribution account of  the after-service health insurance participant has a credit balance, the United  Nations will refund such credit to the individual concerned. It should be noted that  coverage, once cancelled, is not subject to reinstatement.        Section 6  Staff member married to another staff member    6.1 In the case of a staff member married to another staff member, the insurance  coverage, whether at the two-person or family level, must be carried by the higher  salaried staff member while both are in service. In the event of divorce or the death  of the spouse who pays the insurance contributions, a staff member who was  enrolled as a spouse under the coverage of the other spouse maintains individual  participation status, together with his or her eligible dependants, for the purpose of  any subsequent after-service health insurance coverage provided he or she meets the  service eligibility requirements set out under section 2 above.  6.2 If one spouse retires from service with the Organization before the other  spouse, the spouse remaining in active service must become the subscriber. This  applies even if the retired spouse had been the subscriber up to the date of  retirement and is otherwise eligible for after-service health insurance coverage  following separation from service. If both staff members have separated from  service and if each individually is eligible for after-service health insurance  coverage, the cost of the contribution towards the after-service health insurance  coverage must be borne by the former staff member with the higher pension or  theoretical pension if applicable.        Section 7  Application for after-service health insurance coverage    7.1 The application documents relating to enrolment in the after-service health  insurance programme may be submitted to the office administering the after-service  health insurance plan up to 31 days prior to separation but no later than 31 days  following the date of separation. In cases in which eligibility for after-service health  insurance coverage accrues as a result of the death of a staff member, the surviving  spouse and/or eligible dependent children must apply for after-service health  insurance coverage within the three months following the date of death of the staff  member. Application forms will be receivable only if they are accurately completed  and filed on a timely basis.  7.2 Subject to the provisions of section 5 above, after-service health insurance  coverage of the surviving spouse and dependent children who are covered under the  after-service health insurance at the time of a former staff member's death will be  continued without interruption unless such surviving spouse or dependent children  request that coverage be cancelled.  7.3 Staff members separating from service at Headquarters may submit the  relevant application forms directly to the Health and Life Insurance Section, Office  of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, room FF-300. Staff members at  ST/AI/2007/3      07-43395  8    other duty stations who apply for after-service health insurance coverage under a  plan administered at Headquarters must submit the relevant application forms  through their administrative office, not directly to the Health and Life Insurance  Section at Headquarters. Staff members separating from service at other duty  stations who wish to apply for after-service health insurance coverage under a plan  that is not administered at Headquarters should contact the local human resources  office or the office administering their in-service health insurance coverage.  7.4 Staff members who are close to retirement or early retirement should ensure  that they are provided with all relevant information concerning the after-service  health insurance programme. Such information is available from the office  administering their in-service health insurance coverage.        Section 8  Transfer from one health insurance plan to another    8.1 At the time of retirement, a staff member may switch from the insurance plan  which he or she had on an in-service basis to a health insurance plan which is more  appropriate following separation from service, under certain conditions. For  example, a staff member who, while in active service, participated in a Headquarters  health insurance plan, may switch to a non-United States-based plan if he or she will  reside outside the United States following separation from service, provided that  covered dependants will also reside outside the United States.  8.2 After-service health insurance participants who change their country of  primary residence following separation may also transfer from one insurance plan to  another if a different plan is more appropriate to the new country of residence. In  such cases, the change in plan will become effective on the first day of the month  following receipt of written notification regarding the change in country of  residence or as soon thereafter as is practicable. With respect to health insurance  plans available to after-service participants who reside in the United States, transfer  from one plan to another may be made subject to the condition that there must be  two years' coverage under any such plan before a change can be made.        Section 9  Final provisions    9.1 This instruction shall enter into force on 1 July 2007.   9.2 Administrative instruction ST/AI/394 of 19 May 1994 and the related addenda  and amendments are hereby abolished.

I.  Procedure and scope of application    A.    Definitions    1.  In this Agre ement, the e xpression ""translator"" is understood to m ean a translator,  precis-writer, report-writer, verbatim reporter, editor, term inologist, reviser of  translations, reviser of summary records,  reviser of minut es, reviser of reports,  reviser of verbatim records or reviser of  terminology records.  Organizations m ay  also apply the provisions of this Agre ement to any other related professional- category function concerned with language docum entation services, such as a  proof-reader/editor, a co py preparer or a translation support officer, according to   the customary internal practices of t hat Organization.  The expression ""translator""  does not re fer to an int erpreter.  A desc riptive list of this group of functions is  found in section III below.    2.  For the purposes of t his Agreement, ""short-term  translators"" also refers to  ""temporary"", ""freelance"", or ""supernum erary"" conference translators, term s used  by some organizations in accordance with their internal staff provisions.     3.  The present Agreem ent does not regulate the conditions for the recru itment of   contractors (i.e. persons who perfor m translation services paid by the word), who  may be recruited under ""Special Service Agreements"".    4.  Mandated activities of  organizations party to this Agreement are def ined in, or   derive from:    (a) The Charter of the United Nations, statutes and treaties or other international  instruments as applicable, which establish the respective organization with its  object, purpose and functions;   (b) Decisions of their policym aking or gans/governing bodies s et up by those  international agreements; and   (c) Decisions by their respective executive heads on implementation activities of  the Organizations.    5.  For the purposes of  this Agreem ent, the expression ""internal staff provisions"" is  understood to mean the Staff Regulations and Rules, human resources policies and  practices, administrative instructions, service orders or other equivalents according   to the customary internal usage of each Organization.  6.  In this Agreem ent, the term  ""on-site"" refers to work carried out at a  location  specified by the e mploying Organi zation, and/or in pre mises provided by that  Organization.

The profess ional domicile of translators, members of the  Association is published in the Associat ion's Directory.  T he organizations will  request a translator who is not a m ember of the Association to declare his/her  professional domicile when s/he seeks or accepts employment by an organization.   A translator may have only one professional domicile at any time and may change  it only for consecutive peri ods of not less than one ye ar.  Employment conditions  shall be governed by the professional dom icile of the translator at the time on-site  employment is offered.    8.  For the purposes of off-site contracts c overed by this Agreem ent, the place of   residence of the translator (if different from the professional dom icile) is used to  determine the applicable rate (specifically, the relevant post adjustment).    9.  In this Agreement, the term ""Letter of Appointment"" refers to contract.      B.    Scope and implementation    10.  This Agreement governs the e mployment of short-term translators worldwide for   the production of texts  related to th e m andated activities of the e mploying  Organization.    11.  Based on their internal structure and res ponsibilities, Organizations may decide to  extend the application of this Agre ement to docum entation related to non- mandated activities and other language professions.    12.  This Agreement shall be open to all exis ting Organizations members of the United  Nations common system and shall  be ex tended by mutual agree ment to other  organizations invited to join the Agree ment during its period of validity.  The list  of Organizations that are party to the Agre ement is contained in Annex I.   A more  detailed list of organizational entities to which the Agreem ent applies is contained  in Annex II.

In such case, the secretariat of CEB shall in the first  instance seek the agreem ent of the pa rties to the Agreem ent on the proposed  modifications or supplementary provisions by mail, failing which it shall convene  a m eeting of the parties, to be held  no later than three m onths prior to the  expiration of the existing term  of the Agreement, giving at least one m onth's  notice of the date of the meeting.    E.   Exceptional conditions that would require a renegotiation of the Agreement    16.  The provisions of the Agree ment specifi cally concerning remuneration m ay be  renegotiated, at the request of the Organizations or AITC, in the event of:    a) A reform of the international monetary system; or  b) The abandonment by the Organizations of the United States dollar as the sole  basis for the establishment of professional category salaries or allowances; or  c) A modification of the United Nations post adjustment system; or  d) Any other exceptional event or major change  of circumstances in one or several  of the Organizations accepting the Agreem ent which leads any of the parties to   believe that they cannot fully respect th e terms of the Agree ment, including if  said events significantly affect the remuneration levels of short-term translators.      II.   Appointment and termination     A.  Non-discrimination in recruitment    17.  Recruitment of short-term translators shall be conducted in accordance with the  internal staff provisions of the employi ng Organization as well as in accordance  with the principles laid down in the Charter of  the United Nations, in particula r  article 101, paragraph 3, which sta tes, ""The paramount c onsideration in the  employment of the staff and in the determination of the conditions of service shall  be the necessity of securing the highest standards of e fficiency, competence, and  integrity,"" without distinction as to race, gender or religion.     18.  The Organi zations confirm  that, as  set out  in their Internal staff provisions and  standards of conduct, all internationa l civil servants, including short-term  translators, enjoy freedom of association to promote and defend their interests and  that they should enjoy protection against  discriminatory or prejudicial treatm ent  based on their status or such activities as staff representatives.

Proposals of work m ade by  an Organization to a  translator m ay be of t wo  categories: an ""offer"", which is a fir m proposal of work that is binding both on the  Organization that m akes th e offer  and on the translator who accepts i t; and an   ""option"", which is a non-binding proposal for either the employing Organization or  the translator. Only an offer that ha s been both propose d by the e mploying  organization and accepted by the t ranslator in  writing, including by electronic  means, is f irm and shall theref ore give  rise to the paym ent of  the indem nities  specified in section F below.    20.  When an Organization makes an offer of wo rk to a translator and the translato r  accepts it, that offer and the transl ator's acceptance shall constitute a binding  employment contract (hereinafter referred to as a ""confirmation of appointment"").      C.  Letters of appointment    21.  The contracts granted to short-term translators shall indicate:    a) The duty station at which the short-term translator is to be working or, in case of  an off-site contract, the dut y station for which the short- term translator is to be   working as well as her/his place of residence;  b) The period of the contract and the number of work days within the period;  c) The grade level and functional title, by refe rence to the provisions established in  the Agreement under section III below;  d) The applicable remuneration rate, including the number of days to be paid;  e) A reference, where applicable, to a ""Caisse""  and/or accident and sickness   insurance when the regulatory fra mework of the e mploying Orga nization  provides for such an option, and the corresponding percentage to be deducted;  and  f) Whether the engage ment involves travel assignm ent and whether a daily  subsistence allowance (DSA) is payable and, if so, in what form.    22.  The employing Organization shall also provide to a short-term translator in writing  all other supple mentary infor mation necessary for the  i mplementation of the   contract in  accordance with its  internal s taff provisions and other related   operational requirements.    23.  If, after a contract has been accepted, the employing Organization offers extra days  of work in addition to the dates of  work specified in the confir mation of  appointment - whether  those extra dates fall within the initial period of   employment or are an extension of the initial contract period - and if the short-term  translator accepts those extra days, the  contract shall be  modified or  e xtended  accordingly.    24.  Where the Internal staff provisions of the employing Organization so provide, if a  translator is called upon to work longer than the regular wor king hours of sta ff  translators, s/he shall be com pensated in accordance with those Internal staff  provisions.      CEB/AITC Agreement                                     page 8 of 29                                                                       1 January 2013  D.

E.  Copyright and intellectual property    26.    Materials and records dealt w ith by short-term  translators in the course of  their  work are  the property of the  e mploying organization.  Disse mination of  translation/documentation products in for m and/or in content represents a  violation of the intellectual property ri ghts of the e mploying Organization and a   contravention of the relevant provisions  of its Internal staff provisions, as  applicable.  The title rights, copyrights and all other rights of whatever nature in   any document are vested exclusively in the employing Organization.    27.   Subject to agreement by the employing Organization, short-term translators shall  be entitled to keep their translations a nd related products in their own computer- assisted translation tools.      F.    Cancellation or termination of appointment    28.

For the purposes of this Agreem ent, the ter m ""force  majeure"" refers to unfor eseen events not within the control of either party and  independent of their will.2    29.   When reasonable travel costs have been incurred by the short- term translator as  a direct result of the engagem ent, the employing Organization shall reim burse  the short-term translato r subject to the rule s an d adm issible lim its on travel  expenses applicable to staff on an a nalogous basis, as provided under section VI  below. Short-term translators shall comply with the reim bursement process and  applicable f inancial se ttlement proce dures, including in re spect of requisite  supporting documentation.    30.  In cases of  ill h ealth3 or for reasons such as abandonm ent of appointm ent or  assigned function, m isconduct, unsatisfactor y service or the di scovery of facts  anterior to the appointm ent of the  shor t-term translator which, had they been  known at that tim e would, under the principl es established in the Charter of the  United Nations or the interna l staf f provisions of the e mploying Organization,  have precluded her or his appointment, th e Organization shall pay the short-term  translator such indemnities as are pr ovided for in the Organization' s internal staff  provisions applicable to short-term or temporary members of the staff.    31.    As a general principle in respect of  cancellation indem nities, the sh ort-term  translator shall make every effort to find reasonably equivalent employment for  the period in respec t of  which s uch indem nities are p ayable, and  if an  employment is obtained with an Orga nization or third pa rty, the indem nity  payable shall be reduced by one day for each day thereof.      G.  Abandonment of duties, resignations and no shows    32.   The employing Organization has the right to apply the remedies and disciplinary  measures that are foreseen in its internal  rules or in the le tter of appointm ent,  including the withholding of all or part of the remuneration due , if a short-term   translator abandons her/his position or assigned function prior to the completion  of the period of employment and the related contracted services.    33.   The employing Organization may draw to the attention of AITC for disciplinary  investigation any case where the conduc t of one of its m embers has been  unsatisfactory, further to which AITC sh all decide upon the additional actions it  considers appropriate, in consulta tion with the em ploying Organization  concerned (see also sect. VIII).                                                                 2  In case of doubt as to the applicability of this article, parties shall confer and come to an agreement.  3  In such cases, the employing Organization with available insurance coverage schemes for short- term or freelance personnel will endeavour to ensure that the insurance coverage does not cease.

Operational standards for off-site work    42.  Short-term translators  working off- site on prem ises not provided by the  Organization shall observe the Orga nization's operational standards in  performing and transm itting their work,  such as with respect to s oftware  requirements and information-technology security.    43.  The em ploying Organization shall provi de a reasonable degree of technical  support to enable translators to comp ly with the Organization' s operational  standards.    44.  Notwithstanding the above, the off-site wo rk arrangement cannot give rise to an  obligation for the em ploying Organization to fund any equipm ent or licensing  that freelance interpreters may need in order to assure the correct and admissible  delivery of the professional services fo r which they are engaged and paid.            V.  Compensation policy    A.  General    45.  The com pensation policy for short-term  translators established by this  Agreement seeks a general alignm ent w ith the prin ciples applicable to   compensation of  staf f in the inte rnational p rofessional ca tegory of  th e Unite d  Nations common system, with appropriate ad justments.  In accordance with this  alignment, the remuneration of short-term translators is derived by application of  the methodological parameters specified in Annex III.    46.  When the International Civil Service Commission promulgates updated salary  scales for the Professional and higher  categories of staf f or updated daily  subsistence allowance rates (DSA) at any time during the period of employment  of a short-term  translator, the am ounts paid to the translator under the term s of  the contract shall be adjusted accord ingly, including  retro actively where  applicable.      B.  Non-regression    47.  The rates derived under the m ethodology established in the ""1991 CEB/AITC   Agreement' will remain in force until the entry into force of the new Agreement  on 1 January 2013.  T he rate or rates in  force as at 31  Decem ber 2012 will  remain frozen until the application  of  the m ethodology set out in An nex III  results in an increase in the rates payable, as applicable.    48.    The principle of non-regression shall apply to the annual recalculation and the  mid-year review of the  rate sch edules, spe cifically th e post adjustm ent  multipliers (PAMs), as d etailed in Annex III. In accordance with said principle,  any rate(s) yielding a lowe r valu e as a result of possible decreases  in the  concerned PAM(s) will not be applied and the r ates in f orce at such tim e will  continue to be observed  until such tim e an increase is de rived f ollowing the  compensation methodology and mechanics prescribed under this Agreement.

The sala ry rates  set o ut in Anne x III  are net of both incom e tax and staff  assessment.7        D.  Daily contracts    50.  A short-term translator employed by an Organization for less than 31 days from   the first day of her/his appointm ent shall be employed on the basis of a daily  appointment and the daily rate cond itions as prescribed und er Annex III to th is  Agreement.  One daily rate shall be paya ble to the short-term translator for each  working day, a day being defined as a 24-hour period from midnight to midnight  or part thereof.    51.  By reference to the seven-day weekly cal endar, the sixth and seventh days shall  also be paid to short-term translators when they are requested to report for work   by the employing Organization.        E.  Monthly contracts    52.  The following provisions shall apply with respect to monthly rates:    a) A short-term translator employed by an organization for a continuous period of  31 days or more of his/her appointment shall be e mployed from the first day on  the basis of a monthly appointment and the monthly rate conditions;  b) The m onthly salary under such appoint ments shall be determ ined using the  methodology indicated in Annex III;  c) Similarly to regular staff, the monthly contract shall be paid irrespective  of the  actual num ber of calendar days in the  month concerned or whether the first  working day falls on the first calendar day of the month;  d) Annual leave shall accrue at the rate specified in the Internal staff provis ions of  the employing Organization for te mporary staff. Any accrue d annual leave not  utilized by the end of the contract may be commuted into a sum of money for the  rest of the period of such accrued annual l eave as prescribed by the Internal staff   provisions of the e mploying Organization.  Unl ess otherwise calculated by the   internal staff provisions of the  e mploying Organization, paym ent of unuse d  annual leave balance shall be subject to the following adjustment: "" monthly rate  x 12 / 251""  per day, where 251 = 365 - 104 ( weekends) - 10 (United Nations  holidays).                                                                     7  Some employing  Or ganizations r eserve their position regar ding the question  of poss ible  reimbursement of tax if it were to be levied.  The International Fund for Agricultural Development  (IFAD) shall not be responsible for national income tax levied and reserves its position with regard  to possible reimbursement of tax if it were to be levied.  The rates in ann ex III are agreed on the  assumption t hat i n a ll cases t hey are net of ta x on income a nd of staff assessment.  If  i n spit e of  efforts by organizations this assumption should prove incorrect in any particular ca se, AITC would  wish to reopen the matter of rates in that particular situation. IFAD reserves its position with regards  to: (i) the status granted to its free-lance translators under the AI TC Agreement, (ii) the privileges  and immunities acco rded to free- lance tran slators under its  Headquarters Agreem ent, the  Convention on th e Privileges and  I mmunities of the United Nations  and  the Convention on the  Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies.

Calculation and promulgation of remuneration rates    53.  The CEB secretariat shall be respons ible for the periodic review and  computation of any changes to the sche dule of rates prescribed under this  Agreement, by application of the parameters of the compensation policy detailed  under Annex III, and for their p rompt no tification to  the Organizatio ns and   AITC for implementation.        G.  Application of rates    54.  Headquarters rates are established  for Geneva, London, Madrid, Montreal,  New York, Paris, Rome and Vienna and a world rate is establish ed for all other  locations.    55.  Headquarters rates shall be payable to:    (a) short-term translators whose professional domicile is one of the headquarters duty  stations when they work on the premises of an organization at that duty station;  (b) short-term translators whose place of re sidence is one of the headquarters duty   stations when they work off-site for an organization at that duty station.8    56.  The World rate shall be payable in all other cases.      VI.  Travel conditions    A.  General    57.  Except as m ay be otherwise provided in  th is Agreem ent, the trav el rules   applicable to the regula r staff of the employing Organization while on official  travel sh all be applicab le to the travel  of short-term  tran slators.  Trav el and   payment of applicable subsistence allowance for the period concerned shall be  provided fo r a short-term translator as for regular staff if required to p roceed  from her/his declared professional d omicile (or from another place with in the  same cost) to another place of work a nd return.  This provision  s hall no t  preclude any arrangement whereby costs may be shared between the employing  Organization and a previous or subse quent employer, as applicable.  The  Organizations shall make every effort to ensure uniformity of practice in respect  of travel rules.                                                                 8   These duty stations are Geneva (including France voisine), London, Madrid, Montreal, New York,  Paris, Rome and Vienna.

No travel shall take place without trav el authorization, including prior m edical  and security clearances where applicable.  The employing Organization shall not  be held liab le if  a short-term  translat or does not provide appropriate m edical  certification prior to her/his engagem ent.  Failure to do so could resu lt in the  withdrawal of the offer or termination of appointment without compensation.    59.  When an employing Organization offers a  short-term tran slator a con tract, it  shall endeavour to inform  her/him of the arrangem ents it intends to m ake for  transportation.  This information can be provided via the offer of appointment or  other official written communication, su ch as e-m ail notification.  If the  individual accepts th e contract, s/he sh all accept whatever travel arrang ements  are made, unless her/his professional obligations prior to or subsequent to her/his  contract are such as to render im practical, in the opinion of the Organization,  participation in such arrangements.    60.  If the e mploying Organization does not pr ovide a laissez-passer or other such  documentation (for example, in order to obtain a visa) as m ay be needed under  the translator's confirmation of appointm ent to enable her or him  to undertake  the requ ired official travel, then an y period of work which the trans lator is   unable to pe rform for that rea son shall entitle the translator to com pensation as  described in section II.F (Cancellation or  term ination of appointm ent) of this  Agreement.  The e mploying Organizati on expects th e transla tor to f ully  cooperate in all process es required in  order to  obtain such  documents, failing  which compensation will not be paid.     B.  Remuneration during travel and travel time    61.  The travel r ules applicable to the r egular staff of the employing Organization  shall be app licable to th e travel of short-term translators.  For the purp oses of  this Agreement, authorized travel time of short-term translators constitutes work  time for all purposes, as  for regular staff.  The t ravel dates shall be specified in  the con tract whenever possi ble.  Accordingly , excep t w hen it is agreed in   advance that any n ecessary travel can  reasonably be acco mplished du ring th e  period of assignm ent, short-term  transl ators recruited from outside the duty  station shall be paid one half of the rele vant rate in Annex II I in r espect of the  calendar day preceding  the beginning of he r/his assignment and one half-day' s  salary in respect of the calendar day following the e nd of her/his assignm ent.   For any addition al f ull calendar day of  travel tim e, including authorized   stopovers and rest periods, short-term translators shall receive a full day's salary.    62.  Applicable DSA shall be payable to shor t-term translators during the length of  the assignment while o n travel status, including any non-wor k days during the  contract period.      C.  Daily subsistence allowance    63.  A short-term translator travelling at the request of an employing Organization to  serve in a duty station away from her/his declared professional domicile shall be  entitled to rece ive the  applicable  DS A in a ccordance with th e D SA rates   established by the In ternational C ivil Se rvice Comm ission (ICSC).  The   conditions for the paym ent of the  allowance shall be those applicable to the  regular staff of the employing Organiza tion, including in resp ect of adjusted    CEB/AITC Agreement                                     page 17 of 29                                                                       1 January 2013  rates (e.g. when accom modation, transportation and/or m eals are p rovided) and  also if supporting documentation requirements are prescribed.      D.  Standards for travel entitlements    64.  The travel itinerary, the standards of accommodation, stopovers and rest periods  during travel, if applicable, shall be  governed by the rules and policies of the  employing Organization regarding travel by its regular staff.        VII. Social security    65.  The remuneration rates for short-term  translators are set out in Annex III.  The  rates include a 9 per cent add-on to the ba se salary ra te as a social security   element of the com pensation package.  The 9 per cent add-on is not applied if  the em ploying organization is already  providing social security coverage  (pension benefits or contri butions) in respect of the short-term  translator by  virtue of the short-term rules of the organization, or if the short-term translator is  in receipt of a benefit from  any pension scheme of an organization party to this  agreement.As detailed  in Annex III and illustrated in  the Appendix, th e  Agreement accordingly provides for schedules of rates with and without the 9 %  social security element add-on.    A.  Pension    66.  Subject to the rules an d policie s of  the e mploying Organization allow ing for  such financial arrangements, and at the written request of a short-term translator,  the employing Organization shall deduct from  her or his salary a sum  equal to  12.39 per cent thereof, and shall pay the said amount, in the translator' s name,  into the Caisse de pensions des interpretes et traducteurs de conference (CPIT).      B.  Sickness and accident insurance and sick leave    67.  Subject to  the ru les an d policies of the em ploying Organization, entitlem ents  related to sick leave may be granted as provided for other short-term staff under  the applicable rules, and  within the term s and duration of the contract in force,  without any additional obligation for the employing Organization beyond said  provisions (such as in respect of hospitalization, insurance coverage, etc).      C.  Loss of earnings    68.  Subject to the rules of the em ploying Organization, and to the extent possible,  short-term translators may be allowed to  participate in a lo ss of earnin gs and  insurance s cheme f or illn ess o r injuri es occ urring during their re spective  appointments, if such a scheme is in place at the employing Organization.

Short-term trans lators are subject to  the internal staff provisions of the  employing Organization and to the applicable disciplinary procedures.         IX.  Settlement of disputes    70.  Every effort shall be made to resolve disagreem ents between an em ploying  Organization and a short-term  translator in an informal and expeditious m anner  with a view to settling them without recourse to the procedures outlined below.    71.  Disputes between a short-term translator and an employing Organization arising  out of the application of  an individual letter of appoi ntment shall be settled  through the procedures and under the sam e conditions applicable to the regular  staff of the Organization c oncerned, or any other procedure provided for in the  letter of appointment or in this Agreement.    72.  Disputes between AITC and an Organizati on or organizations arising out of the  interpretation or application of this Agreement shall in a first stage be the subject  of direct conversations between AITC and the Orga nization or Organizations  concerned, with a view to settling the di spute; if no settlem ent can b e reached,  the two par ties shall refer the m atter as r apidly as possib le to a jo intly agreed  third party for an opinion.  On the basi s of that opinion, the parties shall  endeavour to find, within a reasonable  tim e fra me, a mutually acceptable  solution.        X.  Other provisions    A.  Training    73.  To the exte nt possible, Organiza tions shall f acilitate the pa rticipation of short- term translators in training programme s offered to m embers of the regular  language staff, provided that such particip ation shall carry no additional cost or  administrative burden for the Organizati on. In cases where there is such an  additional cost or adm inistrative burde n, the Organization sh all do its best to  notify short-term  translators of such training programm es and invite them to  participate if the translators are willing to defray the additional cost.        B.   Professional delegations    74.  AITC shall designate professional delega tions which shall ensure liaison with  the Organizations on questions of mutual interest, including matters arising from  sections VIII and IX above, and the Organizations shall facilitate such activity.

Summary of criteria and methodological parameters governing the  compensation policy of the AITC    1.  As explained in section V above, the new compensation policy prescribed under  the Agreement is alig ned to the  policie s for the compensation of staff in the  international professional category of  the United Natio ns common system  with  appropriate adjustments. This alignment is primarily done by deriving the ""salaries"" of  the short-term translators by application of the salary scale for the professional category  (hereinafter referred to as the annual  UN professional salary  scale), which is  promulgated by the International Civil  Service Comm ission (IC SC) and provides a  common annualized base salary pay schem e for professional cate gory staff of the  United Nations Common System worldwide.     2.  The compensation or rate scheme for the short-term translators derives from the  following three form ula-based calculations which determine the various schedules of  rates established under the Agreement, as further detailed under sections D and E of this  Annex:    i. The common daily base salary rate (her einafter referred to as th e ""base salary  rate"") is derived by dividing the net dependency rate at step one of the respective  Professional category level of the annual UN salary scale into 12 m onths or  into a 221-day compression (365 days m inus 52 week-ends, m inus 30 days  annual leave and m inus 10 public holidays) . This calculation sets the comm on  base salary rate for each grade of the AITC Agreement (namely, T-1 to T-5);    ii. The post adjustment multiplier (PAM) for each one of the select duty stations   for which rates a re es tablished is then applie d to the co mmon base salar y  explained above. For the purposes of this Agreement, the PAMs applied shall be  the annual com posite of the average of the mid-month values of the previous  twelve m onths' post a djustment multipliers for each duty station,  with an   adjusted formula for the World rate, as explained in paragraphs 15 and 21 below;    iii. A nine percent supplement for social security is added to the base salary rate,  which is conversely not applied if th e short-term  translator already has  Organization-provided social security  coverage (pension benefits or  contributions).        B.   A two tier schedule of rates shall be established (Headquarters and World  rates; with and without 9% add on; daily and monthly)    Headquarters rates    3.   Headquarters rates shall be establishe d for eight headquarters duty stations:  Geneva, London, Madrid, Montreal, New York, Paris, Rome and Vienna.          CEB/AITC Agreement  (Annex III)                                    page 23 of 29                                                     1 January 2013  World rate    4.  A world rate shall be established and applied to all other locations.      Application of the rates    5.  As explained in section V.G (paragra phs 54-56), the plac e of res idence and   professional dom icile of the free-lance tr anslators vis-a-vis th e duty station of  assignment would determine the applicable remuneration.      Schedules of rates    6.  The schedules of rates as at 1 January 2013 are attached  to the Appendix rates,  including sets with and wit hout the 9% add on for Social security, as prescribed under  paragraph 65.      C.  USD denomination of the rates and policy for their conversion into Local  Currencies (LCs) for payment purposes as required    7.  As the rates are derived from  the annual UN professional category salary scale,  which is denom inated in United States dollars , the schedule of rates are all and only  determined in United S tates dollars for each  established d uty station.  For practical  purposes, the ' conversion' of the USD rates in to local currencies (LCs) is done only at  the in itial r ate s etting or 6-month revision exercises by ap plication of  the 12 -month  rolling average United Nations operational ra te of exchange for each concerned LC.    Irrespective of exchange rate fluctuations, the schedules of rates remain fixed for the 6- month period.  The World rate is denominated only in US Dollars.    8.  For payroll/disbursement purposes, the monthly payments of the USD rates into  local currencies are made as for an y other payment, namely with the a pplicable United  Nations Operational Rate of Exchange in the period of payment converting the fixed  USD denom inated rate into LCs as applicab le. On occasion of the 6-m onth revision   exercise, only if any increase to the rates is derived, the new USD rate(s)  will be again  converted into local currencies by anal ogously using the 12-m onth rolling average  United Nations Operational Rate of Exchange.    9.  The letters of appointm ent shall expr ess the rates as prom ulgated in USD.  Payments shall be made in local currencies.    10.  Notwithstanding the above provisions,  by agreem ent between the concerned  employing organization and the tr anslator, payments may be made in other currencies.  This provision does not represent an oblig ation for the Organizations to observe  payments in third cu rrencies, esp ecially if  this repres ents an a dditional cost and/or  burden.

Methodology for the calculation of daily rates    Headquarters rates    11.  At the beginning of ea ch calendar year , the comm on daily base salary rate  (hereinafter referred to as  the ""daily base rate"") is  derived from  the annual UN  professional salary scale as per the method detailed under paragraph 2 above.     12.  Similarly, the post ad justment m ultiplier (PA M) for each  duty statio n is th en  applied to the base ra te, which sha ll be th e av erage of the m id-month values of the  previous twelve month PAMs for said duty station..     13.  As provided in section VII on 'Social s ecurity', the 9 % add-on is then applied  to the base salary. The combination of daily base rate plus the applicable PAM and the  9% add-on social security element determines the total daily rate (hereinafter referred to  as the ""daily rate"").    14.  As the rates are derived from  a scale de nominated in United States dollars, the  schedule of rates shall be determ ined only in United States dollars for each established  headquarters duty station. Conversion of th e USD rates into local currencies is  computed as explained under section C of th is Annex (both at the rate setting and 6- month revision exercises and for payroll/disbursement purposes).    World rate    15.   In the case of the World rate, at  the beginning of each year, the annual  composite of the average of the m id-month values of the previous twelve m onths' post  adjustment multipliers of the eight headquart ers duty statio ns and the post adjus tment  multipliers of four UN Regional Commissions (Chile, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Thailand)  as well as that of the United Nation s Office at Nairobi (Kenya) are to be added to the  base rate referred to in paragraph 2 above.  The com bination of the base rate, social  security element, and the com posite of these 13 post adjustment multipliers determines  the daily world rate.    16.   The World rate shall be solely denominated in United States dollars.        E.  Methodology for the calculation of monthly rates    Headquarters rates    17.   At the beginning of each calendar year , a co mmon monthly base salary rate  (hereinafter referred to as the ""m onthly ba se rate"") is derived from  the annual UN  professional salary scale as per the m ethod detailed under paragraph 2 above for the  daily base rate, specifically deriving the m onthly base salary rate from the annual net  dependency rate salary at step one of  each grade level of the professional scale (P-1  to  P-5), divided by twelve.    18.

CEB/AITC Agreement  (Annex III)                                    page 25 of 29                                                     1 January 2013  19.  The post adjustm ent applicab le at each duty  station shall be add ed to th e  monthly base rate (see paragraph 17). The co mbination of the m onthly base rate plus  applicable post adjustm ent plus the social  security e lement, if  applicab le, s hall  determine the total monthly rate (hereinafter referred to as the ""monthly rate"").    20.   As the rates are derived from  a scale denominated in United States dollars, the  schedule of rates shall be determ ined only in United States dollars for each established  headquarters duty station. Conversion of th e USD rates into local currencies is  computed as explained under section C of th is Annex (both at the rate setting and 6- month revision exercises and for payroll/disbursement purposes).        World rate    21.   In the case of the World rate, at  the beginning of each year, the annual  composite of the averag e of the m id-month values of the previous twelve m onths post  adjustment multipliers of the eight headquart ers duty statio ns and the post adjus tment  multipliers of four UN Regional Commissions (Chile, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Thailand)  as well as that of the United Nation s Office at Nairobi (Kenya) are to be added to the  monthly base rate referred to in paragr aph 17 above. The com bination of the m onthly  base rate, the 9% add-on social security el ement, if applicable, and the com posite of  these 13 post adjustment multipliers determines the monthly world rate.    22.  The World rate shall be solely denominated in United States dollars.        F.  Biannual adjustment of rates. Administration of the revision and  adjustment of rates    23.   The CEB Secretariat shall be responsibl e for the calculation of adjustm ents in  the schedule of rates effective 1 January and 1 July of each year in acco rdance with the  methodology prescribed under the Agreement as well as for their prompt notification to  the Organizations and to AITC.

Modelled as if staff, well known, transparent, GA-endorsed, stable, predictable, obviates COL/currency exchanges, whilst takes care of equitable pay (equal pay for equal work principle) while adapting the cost of living differential principle. Budget of the UN is mostly in USD, UNORE is a USD-based mechanism, UN Profesional salary scale is determined in USD 7. Non-regression principle: two applications i. No regression ever even if PAMs go down ii. Rates granted to a FLT before the coming into force of the new scheme would be observed, if higher 8. Current AITC computation methodology parameters (Annex V of the AITC Agreement, Revision 1997) Non-local daily rate is calculated as: Daily rates as based on NET S annual salary divided by 323 = daily base rate; Daily based rate multiplied by 9% = social security component Cost of living component calculated based on weighted average PAM in Argentina , Egypt, Geneva, London, Madrid and Paris. Non-local daily rate = daily base rate + social security component + Cost of living component The local daily rates are calculated exactly as above but instead of Cost of leaving component the actual post adjustments of the duty stations are used. It should be noted that the proposed grade equivalencies will be different from the one currently in place. 9. Parameters/Formulae for Daily and Monthly compensation/rate schedule Daily rates: The annual NET D salary at the corresponding grades at step 1 (base rate or base salary) summed with 9% for soc sec and summed again with PAM of the base salary the PAM component is calculated as a rolling average of the last 12 post adjustment values corresponding to each duty station.  The (final) daily rate is this sum divided by 221. The monthly rates are calculated as for the daily (the same summatory) divided by 12 (monthly). 10. Rounding in the event the local currency rates will be required: The base daily rate is rounded to two decimal places,  12-month rolling average PAM is rounded to one decimal place and 12-month rolling average UNORE is rounded to three decimal places.  The final aggregate daily rates are expressed in USD and rounded to the nearest decimal. Rates in local currencies could be rounded as follows:  Swiss France to nearest whole, UK Pound to one decimal point, US and Canadian Dollar  and EURO to nearest 0.5.

The purpose of the present information circular is to inform all staff of the  Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the United Nations Secretariat,  which has been prepared in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 69/249  and 70/255.  2.  The objective of the Framework is to assist the Secretariat in promoting a  culture of integrity and honesty within the Organization by providing guidance and  information to staff members and other United Nations Secretariat personnel 1 on  how the Secretariat acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption.  3.  Staff members at all levels are expected to become familiar with the contents  of the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework and to comply with the guidance  and principles established therein. They must also be aware that committing acts of  this nature will lead to disciplinary measures that may range from written censure to  dismissal.  4.  The issuance of this policy will be accompanied by a communications  campaign Secretariat-wide to raise awareness about fraudulent acts and on how the  Secretariat's acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption, and to ensure that relevant risks are effectively mitigated.         __________________    * Information circulars will be subsequently issued to inform staff members of updates to the  Framework that might be introduced through changes in the Secretariat's regulations, rules,  administrative instructions and standard operating procedures.     1 Other United Nations Secretariat personnel include officials other than Secretariat officials and  experts on mission, individual contractors, consultants, interns, gratis personnel, participants in  advisory meetings, ""when actually employed"" personnel and United Nations Volunteers.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  2/32    Annex       Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption Framework of the  United Nations Secretariat         Summary    Combating fraud and corruption in the United Nations Secretariat is a primary  responsibility of staff, including management, and other United Nations Secretariat  personnel, and is a responsibility that the Secretariat also applies to its relationship  with third parties.     The Secretariat takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption  involving its staff members, other personnel and third parties in relation to their work  with the Secretariat. This means that all allegations of fraudulent acts committed by  any individual or entity involved in a contractual relationship with the Organization  will be vigorously pursued.    ""Fraudulent acts"" include both ""fraud"" and ""corruption"". Fraud encompasses  any act or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or  conceals a material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself,  herself, itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment.  Corruption encompasses any act or omission that misuses official authority or seeks  to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue benefit for  oneself or a third party.    Fraudulent acts are considered misconduct. In the case of staff members, such  acts will lead to disciplinary measures that may range from written censure to  dismissal. Other measures may include the financial recovery of losses to the  Organization and the referral of credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing to  national authorities, when appropriate. Other United Nations personnel may also be  the subject of sanctions for this type of misconduct as defined in the Framework.    Staff members -- and other United Nations personnel -- have the duty to  report any and all possible cases of fraudulent acts either to the Head of Office/  Mission or responsible officer, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management or the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). OIOS has a  dedicated hotline whereby cases may be reported in a confidential manner:  https://oios.un.org/page?slug=reporting-wrongdoing.     The Secretariat is obliged to protect the confidentiality of those reporting  alleged cases of fraudulent acts. It has in place a protection against retaliation policy  that applies to staff members, interns and United Nations Volunteers who have  reported misconduct. Other United Nations personnel should adhere to the provisions  of their respective contracts in this respect.    OIOS is the main entity typically responsible for conducting investigations of  high-risk cases involving complex matters and/or serious criminal cases, including  serious or complex fraud. Lower-risk cases are typically handled by programme  managers or other dedicated investigative bodies.    ST/IC/2016/25    3/32  16-15827      The Secretariat reports to Member States on all cases of fraud through reports  to the General Assembly and the Board of Auditors. In its reports, OIOS refers to  specific investigations of possible misconduct, including fraudulent acts. In addition,  the Secretariat reports on a yearly basis cases of misconduct and/or criminal  behaviour and the disciplinary consequences thereof, as well as cases involving  credible allegations of criminal conduct against United Nations officials and experts  on mission that have been referred to their States of nationality.

The Charter of the United Nations states that the ""paramount consideration in  the employment of the staff and in the determination of the conditions of service  shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence  and integrity..."" (Article 101). The promotion and maintenance of a culture of  integrity and honesty is a basic requirement for combating fraud and corruption and  a primary responsibility of staff, including management, in the United Nations  Secretariat.  2.  The Secretariat takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption  involving its staff members, other personnel or third parties in relation to their work  with the Secretariat. ""Zero tolerance"" means that the Secretariat will pursue all  allegations of fraudulent acts involving any individual or entity covered by the  regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies, procedures and agreements  described in the Framework and that appropriate administrative/disciplinary  measures or contractual remedies will be applied if wrongdoing is established. In  addition, certain matters involving credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing may  be referred to national authorities when appropriate.        II. Purpose      3.  The purpose of the Framework is to assist the Secretariat in promoting a  culture of integrity and honesty within the Organization by providing guidance and  information to staff members and other United Nations Secretariat personnel2 on  how the Secretariat acts to prevent, detect, deter, respond to and report on fraud and  corruption. Other United Nations Secretariat personnel include officials other than  Secretariat officials and experts on mission, individual contractors, consultants,  interns, gratis personnel, participants in advisory meetings, ""when actually  employed"" personnel and United Nations Volunteers. The Framework describes the  Organization's existing regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and  procedures in these areas, including the roles and responsibilities of personnel and  the applicable sanctions.3 In addition, the Framework refers to third parties, who are  obliged to comply with all obligations related to fraudulent acts that are included in  their applicable agreements with the Secretariat.  4.  The Framework should be read in conjunction with the documents and  provisions referenced in annex I, ""Relevant sections of United Nations official  documentation related to fraudulent acts""; annex II, ""List of important treaties,  instruments, regulations, rules, administrative issuances, policies and manuals  governing fraudulent acts in the United Nations""; and annex III, ""Categories of  non-United Nations personnel not covered by the Framework"".      __________________    2 This category does not include: United Nations military experts on mission, including military  observers, military advisers and military liaison officers; United Nations police officers;  members of formed police units; government-provided personnel; and contingent personnel.  Information related to these categories of non-United Nations personnel is included in annex III  to the Framework.    3 See, in particular, the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Towards an accountability system  in the United Nations Secretariat"" (A/64/640).    ST/IC/2016/25    5/32  16-15827      III. Definitions      5.  For the purpose of the Framework, the term ""fraudulent acts"" in the United  Nations Secretariat is intended to include both ""fraud"", which encompasses any act  or omission whereby an individual or entity knowingly misrepresents or conceals a  material fact in order to obtain an undue benefit or advantage for himself, herself,  itself or a third party, or to cause another to act to his or her detriment; and  ""corruption"", which encompasses any act or omission that misuses official authority  or that seeks to influence the misuse of official authority in order to obtain an undue  benefit for oneself or a third party.   6.  Examples of fraudulent acts may include, but are not limited to, the following  acts, which are listed below for illustrative purposes:4    (a)  Submitting falsified documentation;    (b)  Improperly creating and using a document that purportedly authorizes a  staff member or a third party to remove property belonging to the Organization;    (c)  Misrepresenting educational qualifications;    (d)  Making material omissions or false inclusions in personal history profiles  (PHPs);    (e)  Knowingly submitting an education grant, a medical, travel or other  entitlement claim and documentation containing false information;    (f)  Knowingly  including  false  information  in  movement-related  documentation submitted to the Organization;    (g)  Declaring private telecommunications charges to be official;    (h)  Improperly assisting a person external to the Organization to secure  United Nations employment in exchange for money or other favours;     (i)  Improperly assisting a vendor in a procurement process;    (j)  Manipulating a procurement or recruitment process to ensure a certain  outcome;    (k)  Misusing United Nations resources to benefit oneself or a third party;     (l)  Soliciting or accepting bribes;     (m) Revealing internal confidential information in order to obtain a benefit  for oneself or a third party;    (n)  Participating in the recruitment process of a family member or a person  with respect to whom one has an undisclosed conflict of interest;     (o)  Participating in a procurement and/or contract management process  involving a person or entity with whom/which one has an undisclosed conflict of  interest;  __________________    4 Additional examples more specifically related to ""third parties"" are included in sect. X, para. 61,  below.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  6/32      (p)  Manipulating administrative processes to disburse payments to benefit  oneself or a third party, such as by creating fake contracts, fake third-party  beneficiaries or ghost employees;    (q)  Improperly altering the labelling on the salary envelopes of individual  contractors and removing cash from the envelopes, all without authorization;    (r)  Taking property of the United Nations Secretariat without authorization.   7.  Established ""fraudulent acts"" in the United Nations Secretariat are considered  to be ""misconduct"", and article X of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules,  ""Disciplinary measures"", and staff rules 10.1 and 10.2 clearly state the actions that  the Secretariat takes with regard to staff who engage in this type of behaviour. In  addition, sections IX and X below clearly define the actions that are taken in cases  involving other United Nations Secretariat personnel and third parties (including  implementing partners, vendors and non-State donors).        IV. Scope      8.  The Framework is applicable to fraudulent acts throughout the United Nations  Secretariat, which includes peacekeeping missions and special political missions.  The roles of particular actors within the Secretariat are summarized below:    (a)  The Secretary-General, as the chief administrative officer of the United  Nations, is ultimately accountable for the establishment and management of an  effective system for the prevention and detection of, as well as the enforcement of  measures against, fraudulent acts; response to allegations of fraudulent acts; and the  effectiveness of the system of related internal controls in this regard within the  United Nations;5     (b)  Heads of department/office and programme managers are accountable to  the Secretary-General and have the delegated responsibility for ensuring that the  existing internal control system, including all measures aimed at preventing and  detecting fraudulent acts, is functioning effectively; that all measures aimed at  preventing and detecting fraudulent acts are put in place; and that an appropriate  and robust internal control environment is maintained, including those components  related to integrity and ethical values, compliance requirements and disclosure. The  Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management is responsible for reviewing  and updating the Framework as required;     (c)  All staff members are expected to be aware that fraudulent acts, whatever  their extent and form, are contrary to the standards of conduct expected of  international civil servants and, if established, constitute misconduct, as provided  for in staff rule 10.1 of chapter X, ""Disciplinary measures"", of the Staff Regulations  and Rules, for which a staff member may be sanctioned and even dismissed (see  staff regulation 10.1 and staff rule 10.2). In addition, pursuant to staff rule 1.2 (c),  staff members have the duty to report cases of suspected misconduct, including  suspected fraudulent acts, to either a head of department/office, the Assistant  __________________    5 See Charter of the United Nations, Articles 97, 100 and 101; and the report of the Secretary- General entitled ""Towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat""  (A/64/640).    ST/IC/2016/25    7/32  16-15827    Secretary-General for Human Resources Management 6 or the Office of Internal  Oversight Services (OIOS);    (d)  Other categories of United Nations Secretariat personnel7 are governed  by the relevant applicable provisions, in particular consultants and individual  contractors,8 interns,9 United Nations Volunteers under the applicable rules of the  United Nations Development Programme,10 officials other than Secretariat officials  and experts on mission, 11 gratis personnel, 12 participants in advisory meetings, 13  personnel on non-reimbursable loans from sources external to the United Nations  common system14 and ""when actually employed"" personnel;15    (e)  The four internal and external oversight bodies that cover the United  Nations Secretariat are: OIOS, the Board of Auditors, the Joint Inspection Unit and  the Independent Audit Advisory Committee. Those bodies have been established by  the General Assembly to assist in promoting a culture of compliance and integrity  and in deterring fraudulent acts by independently assessing the adequacy and  effectiveness of the internal control systems and, in the case of OIOS, undertaking  investigations into possible cases of fraudulent acts, as appropriate.        V. Prevention measures for fraudulent acts      9.  The Organization has established a comprehensive framework of measures to  prevent cases of fraudulent acts, as listed below.        A. Standards of conduct      10. All United Nations staff members must uphold the standards of conduct that  are prescribed, in particular in the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff  Regulations16 and Rules and the relevant administrative issuances as listed in annex  I to the Framework. Under Article 100 of the Charter, the staff ""shall not seek or  receive instructions from any government or from any other authority external to the  Organization. They shall refrain from any action which might reflect on their  position as international officials responsible only to the Organization"".  __________________    6 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    7 See sect. IX below.    8 See ST/AI/2013/4, on consultants and individual contractors.    9 See ST/AI/2014/1, on the United Nations internship programme.    10 See Conditions of Service for International United Nations Volunteers and the memorandum of  understanding between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the United Nations  Volunteers.    11 See Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat  Officials, and Experts on Mission (ST/SGB/2002/9).    12 See ST/AI/1999/6, on gratis personnel.    13 See ST/AI/2013/5, on participants in advisory meetings.    14 See ST/AI/231/Rev.1, on non-reimbursable loans of personnel services from sources external to  the United Nations common system.    15 See ST/SGB/283, on the use of ""when actually employed"" contracts for special representatives,  envoys and other special high-level positions"". See also sect. IX, para. 45, below.    16 ST/SGB/2016/5.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  8/32    11.  Under staff regulation 1.1, staff members must make a written declaration that  they will, inter alia, exercise ""in all loyalty, discretion and conscience"" the functions  entrusted to them as international civil servants of the United Nations, discharge  those functions and regulate their conduct ""with the interests of the United Nations  only in view"" and respect the obligations incumbent upon them as set out in the  Staff Regulations and Rules.   12. Under staff regulation 1.2, staff members must uphold the highest standards of  efficiency, competence and integrity. It is specified that ""the concept of integrity  includes, but is not limited to, probity, impartiality, fairness, honesty and  truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and status"". Moreover, staff  regulation 1.2 (g) provides that staff members ""shall not use their office or  knowledge gained from their official functions for private gain, financial or  otherwise, or for the private gain of any third party, including family, friends and  those they favour. Nor shall staff members use their office for personal reasons to  prejudice the positions of those they do not favour"".  13. Standards of conduct are repeated and explained further in the Staff Rules 17  and in the Secretary-General's bulletin on the status, basic rights and duties of  United Nations staff members.18 Staff shall also be guided by the International Civil  Service Commission Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service. 19  14. Similar high standards of conduct are required of other United Nations  personnel, as outlined in the Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and  Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission 20 or in  the applicable administrative issuances (see para. 8 (d) above) and provisions  contained in their respective contracts.  15. Standards of conduct for other United Nations Secretariat personnel and third  parties are set forth in their respective contracts.         B. Protection against retaliation      16. The Secretary-General issued a specific administrative issuance prohibiting  retaliation for reporting misconduct and for cooperating with duly authorized audits  or investigations.21 It sets forth protective measures for staff members, interns and  United Nations Volunteers under threat of, or experiencing, retaliation for duly  reporting misconduct or for cooperating with duly authorized audits or  investigations. The protective measures may include measures to safeguard the  interests of the complainant pending the completion of the investigation, such as  temporary suspension of the implementation of the action reported as retaliatory and  temporary reassignment of the complainant.22 If the Ethics Office finds that there is  a credible case of retaliation or threat of retaliation, it will refer the matter in  writing to OIOS for investigation and immediately notify the complainant in writing  __________________    17 See Staff Rules and Staff Regulations of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2016/1).    18 ST/SGB/2016/9.    19 See http://icsc.un.org/resources/pdfs/general/standardsE.pdf.    20 ST/SGB/2002/9.    21 ST/SGB/2005/21.    22 Ibid., sect. 5.6.    ST/IC/2016/25    9/32  16-15827    of that referral. All complaints are handled according to specific procedures that  ensure confidentiality and prompt and proper attention.  17. Any retaliatory measures by a United Nations staff member against a  contractor or his or her employees, agents or representatives, or any other individual  dealing with the United Nations, as a result of that person's reporting misconduct by  a United Nations staff member will likewise be considered misconduct that, if  established, will lead to disciplinary or other appropriate action.  18. The Secretariat is obliged to protect the confidentiality of the individual's  identity and all communications related to misconduct that have been made through  the channels established in paragraph 16 above to the maximum extent possible. 23        C. Risk management      19. Enterprise risk management is a comprehensive process designed to identify,  assess and respond to risks, including fraudulent acts, that could affect the ability of  the Secretariat to effectively achieve its mandates and objectives.  20. While the ultimate responsibility for effective risk and internal control  management within the Secretariat resides with the Secretary-General, every  manager in the Secretariat is responsible for identifying and mitigating the risks that  might affect the operations under his or her responsibility. Systematic fraud risk  assessments should be undertaken in accordance with the Secretariat's enterprise  risk management and internal control policy and methodology. 24 Such analysis  should include known fraud risk factors, potential fraud schemes, control gaps, red  flag identification and mapping. Technical advice on the implementation of  enterprise risk management is available from the Office of the Under-Secretary- General for Management.         D. Internal control system      21. The United Nations internal control system25 is composed of regulations, rules,  administrative issuances, policies, processes and procedures of the Secretariat,  which staff members are obliged to respect, and is designed to provide assurance  regarding the achievement of organizational objectives, adequate resource  utilization, reliable financial reporting and compliance with relevant regulations,  rules and policies, including preventing and detecting fraudulent acts. The system  includes, but is not limited to:    (a)  The regulations, rules and administrative issuances of the Secretariat,  which include:  __________________    23 Ibid., sect. 3. The established internal mechanisms for reporting misconduct are OIOS, the  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management, the head of the department or  office concerned or the focal point appointed to receive reports of sexual exploitation and abuse.    24 The enterprise risk management policy is set out in the report of the Secretary-General on  progress towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat (A/66/692), and  information on the enterprise risk management methodology is available on iSeek.    25 See the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Towards an accountability system in the United  Nations Secretariat"" (A/64/640) and General Assembly resolution 64/259.

ST/IC/2016/25    11/32  16-15827      (ii) The systems for delegation of authority and segregation of duties  (covering finance, human resources, procurement and information technology)  aimed at strengthening internal controls by ensuring that a single individual  does not control all phases of a decision or transaction involving the resources  of the Organization;     (d)  The internal justice system, which seeks to assist in efforts to enhance  accountability and consists of two pillars of dispute settlement mechanisms,  informal and formal: the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation  Services,37 which is central to the informal system, and the Management Evaluation  Unit38 and the system of administration of justice, which are essential parts of the  formal system. The latter comprises two levels of independent judicial review: the  United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal. Relevant  legislation includes the statutes and rules of both Tribunals;39    (e)  The four internal and external oversight bodies that cover the Secretariat  are described in section IV, paragraph 8 (e), above. Of these four, OIOS is the main  internal body that conducts investigations in the Secretariat. OIOS has established a  mechanism to enable allegations to be reported directly to it at https://oios.un.org/  page?slug=reporting-wrongdoing. OIOS is typically responsible for investigating  serious misconduct, including serious or complex fraudulent acts.40        E. Fraud and corruption awareness programme      22. To ensure that the risk of fraud and corruption is effectively mitigated, the  Secretariat implements a communications campaign to raise awareness about  fraudulent acts and their prevention. The Ethics Office promotes an anti-fraud/  anti-corruption culture by fostering an organizational culture of integrity,  transparency and accountability, providing confidential ethics advice to all staff,  including managers, on appropriate standards of conduct and including fraud and  corruption awareness components in its ethics training programmes.  23. In addition, the United Nations intranet site provides information related to the  prevention of fraudulent acts, including common or frequently asked questions and  answers, hotlines, training materials and relevant documentation such as the  Organization's administrative instructions and Secretary-General's bulletins. All  staff members are encouraged to visit the intranet site and familiarize themselves  with its contents.   24. All staff members are expected to complete the mandatory online anti-fraud  training when it is available.     __________________    37 See ST/SGB/2016/7, on terms of reference for the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and  Mediation Services.    38 The Management Evaluation Unit is within the Department of Management and evaluates  managerial decision-making to ensure that it is in accordance with the relevant regulations, rules  and administrative issuances and identifies emerging trends and systemic problems so that  management can take swift corrective action.    39 See General Assembly resolution 62/228; ST/SGB/2010/3, on the organization and terms of  reference of the Office of Administration of Justice; and ST/SGB/2010/9, on the organization of  the Department of Management (sect. 10).    40 See General Assembly resolution 59/287.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  12/32      F. Prevention of conflicts of interest      25. As stated in staff regulation 1.2 (m), a conflict of interest occurs when a staff  member's personal interests interfere with the performance of his or her official  duties and responsibilities or with the integrity, independence and impartiality  required by the staff member's status as an international civil servant. When an  actual or possible conflict of interest does arise (see examples set out in sect. III,  paras. 6 (o) and (p), above), the conflict shall in the first instance be disclosed by  the staff member to his or her head of office, mitigated by the Organization and  resolved in favour of the interests of the Organization.  26. Staff regulation 1.2 (n) further establishes that all staff members at the  D-1 level and above shall be required to file financial disclosure statements 41 on  appointment and at intervals thereafter as prescribed by the Secretary-General, in  respect of themselves, their spouses and their dependent children, and to assist the  Secretary-General in verifying the accuracy of the information submitted when so  requested. The same obligation to file financial disclosure statements is imposed on  certain categories of other staff, including those designated by their heads of  department/office by a subsequent administrative issuance. 42        VI. Reporting fraudulent acts      27. Staff rule 1.2 (c)43 states:  ""Staff members have the duty to report any breach of the Organization's  regulations and rules to the officials whose responsibility it is to take  appropriate action...""  28. Fraudulent acts constitute a violation of the Staff Regulations and Rules and  relevant administrative issuances and, as a result, under staff rule 1.2 (c), any staff  member with information regarding possible wrongdoing in this regard that involves  United Nations property, assets, personnel or third parties is obliged to report the  matter either to the head of office/mission or the responsible officer, 44 the Assistant  __________________    41 The purpose of the United Nations Secretariat's financial disclosure programme, as administered  by the Ethics Office, is to protect the integrity and reputation of the Organization by ensuring  that potential conflicts of interest arising from the financial holdings, private affiliations or  outside activities of staff members can be identified and properly managed.    42 ST/SGB/2006/6 imposes this duty on staff at the D-1 or L-6 level and above, all staff of the  Ethics Office and other staff designated by their heads of department/office (including staff  whose principal duties involve procurement or investment of assets and other staff with direct  access to confidential procurement or investment information (sect. 2.1 (b), (c) and (d)) and  describes how the Organization may proceed against any staff member who fails to comply with  the filing of obligations under the disclosure programme.    43 See Staff Rules and Staff Regulations of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2016/1).    44 See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures. In the case of  peacekeeping missions, in addition to the above, cases can be reported to the commanding  officers in the missions or the heads of civilian, police or military components for onward  transmission to the head of mission and his or her supporting Conduct and Discipline Team or  the conduct and discipline focal point. The focal points on sexual exploitation and abuse are also  authorized to receive reports of cases of this nature.

OIOS can provide  advice on potential fraudulent acts and receive reports in a confidential manner  through the dedicated hotline, accessible at https://oios.un.org/page?slug=reporting- wrongdoing.  29. As noted above, the Secretariat has an established protection against  retaliation policy applicable to staff members, interns and United Nations  Volunteers who allege that they have been subjected to retaliation or the threat of  retaliation as a consequence of reporting misconduct or cooperating with a duly  authorized audit or investigation.46 Other United Nations personnel should adhere to  the provisions of their respective contracts in this regard.  30. United Nations military experts on mission, including military observers,  military advisers and military liaison officers; United Nations police officers;  members of formed police units; government-provided personnel; and contingent  personnel, information about whom is included in annex III to the Framework, are  not considered United Nations personnel. They are subject to the investigation and  disciplinary authorities and procedures of the contributing Member State.  Nonetheless, any staff member with information regarding any possible misconduct  involving this category of non-United Nations personnel is obliged to report the  matter to either the head of office/mission or a responsible officer,47 the Conduct  and Discipline Team 48 or OIOS.49 The United Nations, for its part, is obliged to  report, without delay, alleged misconduct, including fraudulent acts, by national  contingent members to their respective Governments.         VII. Investigations of allegations involving United Nations staff      31. Staff rule 1.2 (c), ""Basic rights and obligations of staff"", establishes that:  ""Staff members have the duty to report any breach of the Organization's  regulations and rules to the officials whose responsibility it is to take  appropriate action and to cooperate with duly authorized audits and  investigations. Staff members shall not be retaliated against for complying  with these duties.""  32. All allegations of misconduct -- including fraudulent acts -- are reviewed and  investigated, as appropriate, by the Secretariat. As stated in the administrative  __________________    45 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    46 See ST/SGB/2005/21. Protection against retaliation requests are to be filed with the Ethics  Office. If the Ethics Office determines a prima facie case of retaliation, it will refer the matter to  OIOS for investigation. The policy provides for interim and final retaliation protection measures,  and further prohibits retaliation against contractors or other third parties that report misconduct  by United Nations staff members (further information about the policy may be found in annex II  to the Framework).    47 See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures.    48 In the case of peacekeeping missions, in addition to the above, cases can be reported to the  commanding officers in the missions or the heads of civilian, police or military components for  onward transmission to the head of mission and his or her supporting Conduct and Discipline  Team or the conduct and discipline focal point.    49 See revised draft model memorandum of understanding (A/61/19 (Part III), annex).  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  14/32    instruction on revised disciplinary measures and procedures (ST/AI/371 and  Amend.1),50 heads of office/mission or responsible officers are obliged to undertake  investigations where there is reason to believe that a staff member has engaged in  possible misconduct for which a disciplinary measure may be imposed.   33. OIOS will typically conduct all investigations considered to be high-risk,  complex matters and serious criminal cases, including serious or complex fraudulent  acts.51        VIII. Actions based on investigations of allegations involving  United Nations staff      34. The Secretariat takes appropriate action (disciplinary/administrative and/or  referral to national authorities) against staff members on the basis of the results of  investigations into alleged misconduct.  35. Article X of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, ""Disciplinary measures"",  states, in regulation 10.1 (a), the following: ""The Secretary-General may impose  disciplinary measures on staff members who engage in misconduct"".  36. Staff rule 10.1 (a), ""Misconduct"", states that: ""Failure by a staff member to  comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff  Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances or to observe  the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant may amount to  misconduct and may lead to the institution of a disciplinary process and the  imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct.""  37. Financial rule 101.2 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United  Nations provides that ""[a]ll United Nations staff are obligated to comply with the  Financial Regulations and Rules and with administrative instructions issued in  connection with those Regulations and Rules. Any staff member who contravenes  the Financial Regulations and Rules or corresponding administrative instructions  may be held personally accountable and financially liable for his or her actions.""  38. Possible disciplinary measures range from written censure to dismissal. Other  measures may include the financial recovery of losses to the Organization and the  __________________    50 Currently under revision.    51 See the report of OIOS on strengthening the investigation functions in the United Nations  (A/58/708), which describes ""category I"" and ""category II"" cases, as classified by OIOS.  ""Category II"" cases are described as being of lower risk to the Organization and include the  following: personnel matters, traffic-related inquiries, simple thefts, contract disputes, office  management disputes, basic misuse of equipment or staff, basic mismanagement issues,  infractions of regulations, rules or administrative issuances and simple entitlement fraud. Such  cases can be handled by programme managers. If, however, there is an indication that the case  might involve possible illegal activity and the use of trained professional investigators is  considered essential, then the case should be handled by OIOS. Where programme managers are  entrusted with conducting investigations, the results of their investigations should be reported to  OIOS (see General Assembly resolution 59/287). ""Category I"" cases are classified as high-risk,  complex matters and serious criminal cases, including the following: serious or complex fraud,  other serious criminal act or activity, abuse of authority or staff, conflict of interest, gross  mismanagement, waste of substantial resources, cases involving risk of loss of life to staff or to  others, and substantial violation of United Nations regulations, rules or administrative issuances.  Such cases should be brought to the attention of, and investigated by, OIOS.    ST/IC/2016/25    15/32  16-15827    referral of credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing to national authorities, when  appropriate.   39. In addition, in General Assembly resolution 62/63, on criminal accountability  of United Nations officials and experts on mission, as well as subsequent  resolutions on the same topic, the Assembly requested that, where credible  allegations reveal that a crime may have been committed by United Nations officials  or experts on mission, they be brought by the Secretary-General to the attention of  the States against whose nationals such allegations are made. In addition, those  States should provide an indication of the status of their efforts to investigate and,  as appropriate, prosecute crimes of a serious nature, as well as the types of  appropriate assistance States may wish to receive from the Secretariat for the  purposes of such investigations and prosecutions.  40. In accordance with article 45 bis of the Regulations, Rules and Pension  Adjustment System of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, in cases where a  Pension Fund participant is the subject of a criminal conviction by a competent  national court for fraud against the United Nations, the Fund may, at the request of a  United Nations member organization, remit to the relevant United Nations member  organization a portion of the pension benefit payable to the participant.        IX. Investigation of allegations involving other United Nations  Secretariat personnel      41. Other United Nations Secretariat personnel are governed by the respective  applicable administrative issuances, in particular officials other than Secretariat  officials and experts on mission,52 consultants and individual contractors, 53 interns54  and United Nations Volunteers under the applicable rules of the United Nations  Development Programme.  42. Cases of possible misconduct -- including fraudulent acts -- involving these  categories of personnel should be reported to either the head of office/mission 55/  responsible official, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management56 or OIOS and should be investigated as appropriate, in accordance  with applicable procedures.  43. In the case of officials other than Secretariat officials and experts on mission,  their status, basic rights and duties are established in the Regulations Governing the  Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and  Experts on Mission. 57  The Regulations establish, among other principles, their  standards of conduct and to whom they are accountable. Such officials may also be  subject to applicable provisions established in their respective contracts.  __________________    52 Experts on mission include, e.g., United Nations police officers, members of formed police units,  corrections officers and military observers; see Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights  and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission (ST/SGB/2002/9).    53 See ST/AI/2013/4, on consultants and individual contractors.    54 See ST/AI/2014/1, on the United Nations internship programme.    55 Cases involving missions can also be reported to the Conduct and Discipline Team.    56 If a report is made to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management with  respect to a matter not implicating a staff member of the Office of Human Resources  Management, the Assistant Secretary-General will transmit such report to OIOS.    57 ST/SGB/2002/9.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  16/32    44. In addition, the obligations described in section VIII, paragraph 39, above in  relation to General Assembly resolution 62/63 apply to United Nations experts on  mission.   45. Special representatives, envoys and other special high-level positions may be  contracted by the Organization on short-term appointments or other types of  contracts 58 and on a ""when actually employed"" basis. In the case of short-term  appointments, the oath of office shall be attached to the letter of appointment for  signature by the holder. The oath of office states that, as a staff member, he or she is  subject to the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations during the days of  his or her service, with all the rights, obligations and accountability measures that  that entails. In the case of other types of contracts, the conditions of service are  stated in paragraph 46 below.  46. Other personnel can be contracted with special service agreements, as well as  on a ""when actually employed"" basis. Their conditions of service are set out in the  contract document and the provisions of the administrative instruction on  consultants and individual contractors.59 In addition, if the individual concerned also  has the status of expert on mission, he or she will also be subject to the Regulations  Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat  Officials, and Experts on Mission.   47. Finally, the provisions of the Secretary-General's bulletin governing the use of  ""when actually employed"" contracts for special representatives, envoys and other  special high-level positions 60 apply to short-term appointments or other types of  contracts as applicable.  48.  With respect to consultants and individual contractors, their duties, obligations  and systems of sanctions are defined in the administrative instruction governing the  contracting of consultants and individual contractors in the United Nations  Secretariat61 and in the general conditions of contracts for the services of consultants  and individual contractors that apply to this category of personnel and that are  incorporated into their individual contracts.   49. In the case of gratis personnel,62 the standards of conduct and accountability  measures to which they are subject are established in sections 11 and 12 of the  administrative instruction governing their relationship with the Secretariat.63  50. In the case of participants in advisory meetings, their terms and conditions are  set out in section 2 of the administrative instruction governing the relationship of  the Secretariat with this type of other United Nations personnel.64  __________________    58 Contract for the services of a consultant or individual contractor.    59 ST/AI/2013/4.    60 ST/SGB/283.    61 ST/AI/2013/4.    62 ""Gratis personnel"" refers to personnel who are provided to the United Nations by a Government  or other entity responsible for the remuneration of the services of such personnel and who do not  serve under any other established regime such as that applicable to interns, associate experts,  personnel provided on a non-reimbursable loan under the provisions of ST/AI/231/Rev.1 and  personnel provided to the United Nations Special Commission under the regime reported by the  Secretary-General to the Security Council in document S/22508 of 18 April 1991 (see  ST/AI/1999/6).    63 ST/AI/1999/6.    ST/IC/2016/25    17/32  16-15827    51. In the case of United Nations Volunteers, the basic terms of their conditions of  service, as well as their duties and obligations, including those related to  misconduct and disciplinary procedures, are established in the document entitled  ""Conditions of Service for International United Nations Volunteers"" and the  memorandum of understanding between the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations and the United Nations Volunteers.  52.  In the case of interns, their responsibilities, obligations and systems of sanctions  are established in the administrative instruction establishing the conditions and  procedures for the selection and engagement of interns at the United Nations,65 as well  as in the internship agreement governing their contractual relationship with the United  Nations.  53. All of these categories of other United Nations Secretariat personnel are  required to cooperate fully with OIOS or other mandated investigations.        X. Third parties (including vendors, non-State donors and  implementing partners)      54. The Secretariat recognizes that, generally, to legally bind a third party to  comply with certain obligations, such obligations need to be included in a  contractually binding document between the United Nations and that third party. In  this connection, in the case of vendors, the United Nations General Conditions of  Contract, which are to be included as part of all procurement contracts for goods  and/or services entered into by the Secretariat, contain provisions intended to deter  and address fraudulent acts. For example, the ""Observance of the Law"" clause  requires contractors to comply with all relevant laws regarding their performance of  the contract, and includes an express provision requiring contractors to maintain  compliance with all obligations relating to their registration as a qualified vendor of  goods or services to the United Nations, as set forth in the United Nations vendor  registration procedures; the ""Officials not to Benefit"" clause requires contractors to  warrant that they have not, and shall not, offer any United Nations representative,  official, employee or agent a benefit related to the contract or any other contract  with the United Nations or the award of such contracts or for any other purpose  intended to gain an advantage for the contractor; the ""Audits and Investigations""  clause includes an obligation on the part of contractors to cooperate with  investigations/audits; and the ""Responsibility for Employees"" clause includes a  requirement that contractors' personnel respect local laws and conform to a high  standard of moral and ethical conduct.  55. The United Nations awards contracts to vendors registered with the  Secretariat. Vendors seeking to register with the Secretariat must, as part of the  vendor registration process, declare that they meet certain prerequisites. In addition,  vendors are informed that non-adherence to the principles set forth in the United  Nations Supplier Code of Conduct, which, inter alia, describes the Organization's  anti-corruption policies, will be a factor in considering their eligibility to be  registered as a United Nations supplier or to do business with the United Nations.   __________________    64 ST/AI/2013/5.    65 ST/AI/2014/1.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  18/32    56. Chapter 4 of the United Nations Procurement Manual, ""Ethical Standards in  Procurement"", describes the ethical standards and responsibilities expected in  United Nations procurement and includes information regarding corrupt, fraudulent  and unethical practices (chap. 4.10).  57. Chapter 7 of the United Nations Procurement Manual, ""Vendor Registration  and Management"", describes the Vendor Review Committee, which is an internal  review body that reviews and renders advice to the Assistant Secretary-General for  Central Support Services on vendor registration status, including the suspension or  removal of vendors from the ""Register of Vendors"". Upon receipt of  recommendations from the Vendor Review Committee, the Assistant Secretary- General for Central Support Services decides on any changes to a vendor 's  registration status, including suspension or removal from the ""Register of Vendors"".  Vendors are notified of such a decision and are informed that they may request its  review.   58. In the case of non-State donors and implementing partners, the Secretariat's  departments and offices should ensure that adequate due diligence is carried out  prior to engaging in a contractual relationship with them. They are expected to use  resources efficiently and for the intended purpose, and to refrain from, prevent and  mitigate all possible fraudulent acts.   59.  Non-State donors66 and implementing partners must ensure that proper procedures  are in place to address incidents of fraudulent acts. Non-State donors and implementing  partners are also expected to disclose to the Organization any potential conflict of  interest, and also to disclose if any official or professional under contract with the  United Nations may have an interest in or a financial tie to the non-State donor  organization or implementing partner's business.   60. All agreements with implementing partners should contain appropriate  anti-fraud and corruption clauses and clauses stating that they are subject to regular  monitoring activities, verifications and external (including forensic) audits for their  use of United Nations funds and sanctions in the case of proven allegations of fraud.  61. Examples of fraudulent acts by vendors, non-State donors and implementing  partners may include: the forging of documents; making false statements to obtain a  financial or other benefit to which the entity is not entitled; offering something of  value to improperly influence a procurement process; ""collusion"" or other  anti-competitive scheme between suppliers during a tender process to obtain undue  benefits; deliberate substandard compliance with contractual terms; diversion or  misappropriation of funds; purported delivery of diverted goods; billing twice or  multiple times for the same items or services; falsifying internal records that are  used to support claims; failing to report known overpayments and credit balances by  or to the Organization, ""extortion"" or ""coercion"" (the act of attempting to influence  the process of procuring goods, services or works, or executing contracts by means  of threats of injury to person, property or reputation); and so forth.      __________________    66 The term ""non-State donors"" refers to individuals, trusts and foundations, and companies.    ST/IC/2016/25    19/32  16-15827      XI. Reporting to Member States      62. The annex to the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations  (ST/SGB/2013/4), entitled ""Additional terms of reference governing the audit of the  United Nations"", entrusts to the Board of Auditors the responsibility of reporting to  the General Assembly all cases of fraud or presumptive fraud in the context of its  reports to the intergovernmental bodies.   63. OIOS also submits annual reports to the General Assembly on its activities in  peacekeeping and regular budget areas, with references to specific investigations of  possible misconduct, including fraudulent acts.  64. In addition, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/63, on  criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission, and  subsequent resolutions on the same topic, the Secretary-General reports to the  Assembly on an annual basis the number and nature of cases involving credible  allegations of criminal conduct against United Nations officials and experts on  mission, which have been referred to the States of nationality. In accordance with  Assembly resolution 70/114, the Secretary-General's reports also include  information on the United Nations entity involved; the type of crime and summary  of allegations; and the status of any investigation, prosecutorial and/or disciplinary  action taken by national authorities.   65. Finally, cases of misconduct and/or criminal behaviour involving Secretariat  staff members, and the disciplinary consequences thereof, are made public by the  Secretariat on a yearly basis in accordance with General Assembly resolution  59/287, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that all  staff of the Organization are informed of the most common examples of misconduct  and/or criminal behaviour and their disciplinary consequences, including any legal  action, with due regard for the protection of the privacy of the staff member(s)  concerned.        ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  20/32    Annex I    Relevant sections of United Nations official documentation  related to fraudulent acts        A. The Charter of the United Nations      1.  The Charter of the United Nations is the foundational treaty of the  Organization. It establishes, inter alia, that in the performance of their duties, ""the  Secretary-General and the staff shall not seek or receive instructions from any  government or from any other authority external to the Organization"", and also  states that they shall ""refrain from any action which might reflect on their position  as international officials responsible only to the Organization"" (Article 100).  Furthermore, the Charter states that the ""paramount consideration in the  employment of the staff and in the determination of the conditions of service shall  be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and  integrity"" (Article 101).        B. Oath of office      2.  Every United Nations staff member is called upon by the Charter of the United  Nations to uphold the highest levels of efficiency, competence and integrity. This  commitment is reflected in the United Nations oath of office, which every staff  member must take when he or she begins his or her career in the Organization and  which reads as follows:  ""I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and  conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the  United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the  interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept  instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government  or other source external to the Organization.  ""I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations incumbent  upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules.""        C. Outside activities      3.  Staff regulation 1.2 (o) establishes that staff members ""shall not engage in any  outside occupation or employment, whether remunerated or not, without the  approval of the Secretary-General"". Staff rule 1.2 (s) to (v) further establishes  policies with regard to which outside activities may be performed by a staff member  and under what circumstances. Further elaboration on the internal procedures to  follow in regard to these provisions may be found in the administrative instruction  on outside activities (ST/AI/2000/13).        ST/IC/2016/25    21/32  16-15827      D. Gifts and hospitality      4.  Staff regulation 1.2 (j) and (k) establishes that staff members shall not accept  any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from any Government, except in  very limited circumstances under which a staff member may receive these on behalf  of the Organization. Staff regulation 1.2 (l) establishes that staff members shall not  accept  any  honour,  decoration,  favour,  gift  or  remuneration  from  any  non-governmental source without the prior authorization of the Secretary-General.  The administrative instruction on reporting, retaining and disposing of honours,  decorations, favours, gifts or remuneration from governmental and non-governmental  sources (ST/AI/2010/1) provides further elaboration on the processes to follow.  Different provisions apply to staff members involved in the procurement process (see  sect. 4.8 of the United Nations Procurement Manual for guidance).         E. Use of the United Nations emblem      5.  The use of the United Nations emblem and name, including any abbreviation  thereof, is reserved for the official purposes of the United Nations, in accordance  with General Assembly resolution 92 (I) of 7 December 1946. That resolution  expressly prohibits the use of the United Nations name and emblem in any other  way without the express authorization of the Secretary-General, and recommends  that Member States take the measures necessary to prevent the use of the United  Nations emblem and name without the authorization of the Secretary-General.  Article 6 ter of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (the  ""Convention""), revised in Stockholm in 1967, provides trademark protection in  respect of the emblems and names of ""international organizations"" and requires  States parties to the Convention ""to prohibit by appropriate measures the use,  without authorization by the competent authorities"", of the emblems and names of  international organizations. Pursuant to resolution 92 (I), some Member States have  promulgated legislation protecting the United Nations name and emblem, including  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of  America. If any entity other than the United Nations, its funds and programmes and  other subsidiary organs wishes to use the United Nations emblem and name, it is  required to seek prior authorization from the Office of Legal Affairs.        F. Use of property and assets      6.  Staff regulation 1.2 (q) establishes that United Nations assets and property  shall be used only for official purposes and with reasonable care. Moreover,  financial rule 106.7 (a) and (b) authorizes the Under-Secretary-General for  Management to request any staff member to reimburse the United Nations, either  partially or in full, for the loss of assets, including cash, receivables, property, plant  and equipment, inventories and intangible assets, if the staff member is responsible  for such loss.  7.  Further elaboration on the internal procedures related to property and assets of  the Organization may be found in the administrative instructions on the management  of property (ST/AI/2015/4) and on the control of United Nations property covered  by personal property receipts (ST/AI/97/Rev.2).     ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  22/32      G. Financial responsibility of staff members for gross negligence      8.  Staff rule 1.7, ""Financial responsibility"", requests staff members to ""exercise  reasonable care in any matter affecting the financial interests of the Organization, its  physical and human resources, property and assets"". In addition, staff rule 10.1 (b),  ""Misconduct"", establishes that where the staff member's failure to comply with his  or her obligations or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an  international civil servant is determined by the Secretary-General to constitute  misconduct, such staff member may be required to reimburse the Organization, in  full or in part, for any financial loss suffered as a result of the staff member's  actions, if such actions are determined to be wilful, reckless or grossly negligent.  Under financial rule 101.2, ""Responsibility and accountability"", any staff member  ""who contravenes the Financial Regulations and Rules or corresponding  administrative instructions may be held personally accountable and financially  liable for his or her actions"".        H. Relevant provisions of the United Nations General Conditions   of Contract      9.  The United Nations General Conditions of Contract, which are to be included  as part of all procurement contracts for goods and/or services entered into by the  Secretariat, contain provisions intended to deter fraud, as follows:    (a)  The ""Observance of the Law"" clause requires contractors to comply with  all relevant laws regarding their performance of the contract, and includes an  express provision requiring contractors to maintain compliance with all obligations  relating to their registration as a qualified vendor of goods or services to the United  Nations, as set forth in the United Nations vendor registration procedures;     (b)  The ""Officials not to Benefit"" clause requires contractors to warrant that  they have not, and shall not, offer any United Nations representative, official,  employee or agent a benefit related to the contract or any other contract with the  United Nations or the award of such contracts or for any other purpose intended to  gain an advantage for the contractor;     (c)  The ""Audits and Investigations"" clause includes an obligation on the part  of contractors to cooperate with investigations/audits;     (d)  The ""Responsibility for Employees"" clause includes a requirement that  contractors' personnel respect local laws and conform to a high standard of moral  and ethical conduct.        I. Post-employment restrictions      10. The  Secretary-General's  bulletin  on  post-employment  restrictions  (ST/SGB/2006/15) establishes the following restrictions on the post-employment  activities of staff members involved in procurement and the sanctions for violations  of those restrictions:    (a)  For a period of one year following separation from service, former staff  members may not seek or accept employment with, or accept any form of    ST/IC/2016/25    23/32  16-15827    compensation or financial benefit from, any vendor which conducts or seeks to  conduct business with the United Nations and with whom such staff members have  been personally involved in the procurement process during the last three years of  service with the Organization;    (b)  For a period of two years following separation from service, staff  members may not knowingly communicate with, or appear before, any staff member  or unit of the Organization on behalf of any third party on any matters that were  under their official responsibility relating to the procurement process during the last  three years of their service with the Organization;     (c)  While in service, staff members may not solicit or accept, directly or  indirectly, any promise or offer of future employment from any vendor which  conducts, or seeks to conduct, business with the Organization and with whom such  staff members have been personally involved in the procurement process during the  previous three years of service with the Organization.        J. Entities conducting investigations in the United Nations Secretariat      11.  The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established to assist the  Secretary-General in fulfilling his internal oversight responsibilities, in particular  with regard to investigation, inspection and evaluation, monitoring and internal  audit.a It is the primary office charged with investigating high-risk, complex matters  and serious criminal cases -- including complex fraud and corruption cases --  which it has classified as ""category I"" cases. In respect of cases considered to be of  lower risk to the Organization -- classified by OIOS as ""category II"" casesb -- a  number of entities in the Secretariat may conduct investigations and/or  administrative inquiries, as described below:    (a)  Heads of department/office/mission and programme managers: heads of  department or responsible officers shall undertake investigations where there is  reason to believe that a staff member has engaged in unsatisfactory conduct for  which a disciplinary measure may be imposed;c    (b)  Department of Safety and Security: the investigative capability of the  Department of Safety and Security rests within the special investigation units at, for  example, Headquarters, offices away from Headquarters and regional commissions,  which also investigate category II cases;  __________________    a See General Assembly resolution 48/218 B.    b See the report of OIOS on strengthening the investigation functions in the United Nations  (A/58/708), which describes ""category I"" and ""category II"" cases, as classified by OIOS.  ""Category II"" cases are described as being of lower risk to the Organization and include the  following: personnel matters, traffic-related inquiries, simple thefts, contract disputes, office  management disputes, basic misuse of equipment or staff, basic mismanagement issues,  infractions of regulations, rules or administrative issuances and simple entitlement fraud.  ""Category I"" cases are classified as high-risk, complex matters and serious criminal cases,  including the following: serious or complex fraud, other serious criminal act or activity, abuse of  authority or staff, conflict of interest, gross mismanagement, waste of substantial resources,  cases involving risk of loss of life to staff or to others, substantial violation of United Nations  regulations, rules or administrative issuances, and complex proactive investigations aimed at  studying and reducing risk to life and/or United Nations property.    c See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures. See also General  Assembly resolution 59/287, para. 7.  ST/IC/2016/25      16-15827  24/32      (c)  Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field  Support:d    (i)  Panels convened by heads of mission: heads of mission can undertake  investigations where there is reason to believe that a staff member has engaged  in unsatisfactory conduct for which a disciplinary measure may be imposed;e    (ii) Special investigation units of the security sections of field missions are  mandated to investigate all category II cases -- and other, similar  allegations -- occurring in the missions or referred to missions by OIOS for  investigation. Field mission special investigation units can investigate  allegations against all personnel of a mission, but they conduct predominantly  investigations involving civilian personnel, i.e., staff members, United Nations  Volunteers, consultants, independent contractors and employees of United  Nations contractors.        K. Other review mechanism      12. In addition, the Ethics Office conducts ""preliminary reviews"" of retaliation  complaints to ascertain whether a prima facie case of retaliation exists. Such a  ""preliminary review"" is not considered to be an investigation. However, if the  Ethics Office finds a prima facie case of retaliation, it then refers the matter to  OIOS for a complete investigation.f        __________________    d This section does not include areas of the Organization that cover military and police serving in  peacekeeping operations and special political missions, such as: the United Nations military  police (force provost marshal), who usually conduct investigations of possible misconduct by  military personnel (members of contingents, staff officers and United Nations military observers)  in instances where Member States do not exercise their primary jurisdiction to conduct such  investigations or in support of Member State investigations or the United Nations police, who  may investigate breaches of conduct and allegations involving United Nations police personnel  (formed police units and individually deployed United Nations police personnel). Finally, field  mission special investigation units can investigate allegations against all personnel of a mission,  but they predominantly conduct investigations involving civilian personnel.     e See ST/AI/371 and Amend.1, on revised disciplinary measures and procedures.

"human resources","  United Nations    ST/IC/2021/12      Secretariat      3 September 2021    21-12722 (E)    150921  *2112722*         Information circular*        To:  Members of the staff at Headquarters      From:  The Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security        Subject: Arrangements for admission to United Nations Headquarters  during the high-level meetings and the general debate of the  seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly      1.  The purpose of the present information circular is to provide general  information on the arrangements for admission to United Nations Headquarters  during the high-level meetings and the general debate of the seventy-sixth session of  the General Assembly (see annex).  2.  Please note that effective 2022, the arrangements for admission to United  Nations Headquarters during the high-level meetings and the general debate of future  sessions of the General Assembly will be shared through other communication  channels, and not an information circular.            * Expiration date of the present information circular: 2 October 2021.  ST/IC/2021/12      21-12722  2/9    Annex       Arrangements for admission to United Nations Headquarters  during the high-level meetings and the general debate of the  seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly        I. Introduction      1.  The general debate of the seventy-sixth session will be held from Tuesday,  21 September 2021, to Friday, 1 October 2021, pursuant to General Assembly  resolution 57/301.  2.  A Sustainable Development Goals Moment hybrid event, to be convened by the  Secretary-General, will be held on Monday, 20 September.  3.  The Secretary-General will meet Heads of State and Government at a welcome  ceremony on Tuesday, 21 September.   4.  The high-level meeting to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the  adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action will be held on  Wednesday, 22 September, pursuant to resolution 75/237.  5.  The high-level plenary meeting to commemorate and promote the International  Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons will be held on Tuesday,  28 September, in accordance with resolutions 72/251 and 75/45.        II. Admission to the Headquarters premises      6.  In view of the restrictions associated with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  pandemic and the need for close adherence to recommendations for the safe  occupancy and use of Headquarters facilities, heads of departments are asked to limit  the number of staff members present during the general debate period to only those  necessary for the efficient servicing of the meetings. The United Nations will remain  closed to the public, inclusive of guided tours, for the entirety of the high-level  general debate session, which will run from Tuesday, 21 September 2021, until close  of business on Friday, 1 October 2021. The reopening of the building to the public  and the resumption of guided tours will be announced at a later date.  7.  While the premises are closed to the public, staff members are requested to  schedule appointments with visitors and guests at locations away from the  Headquarters site. The information and reception desk will be relocated from the  General Assembly lobby to the 45th Street entrance of the UNITAR Building, located  at the corner of First Avenue and 45th Street. This arrangement will remain in place  for the duration of the General Assembly high-level period.   8.  Staff members, delegates and accredited media representatives who are entitled  to obtain access to the Headquarters premises will be admitted only upon presentation  of a valid United Nations grounds pass or laissez-passer.  9.  In view of the enhanced safety protocols during the general debate period, which  include the wearing of masks, the cooperation of all who are present at the complex  is required. Furthermore, the wearing of grounds passes will be strictly enforced.  Grounds passes must be worn prominently on the outer clothing of the holder to aid  verification and reduce undue delays.  10. In the interest of ensuring the safety of all concerned, it is important to maintain  the integrity of grounds passes because of the access that they allow the holder. All  authorized pass holders are therefore reminded that their grounds passes are solely    ST/IC/2021/12    3/9  21-12722    for the use of the bearer to whom they are issued and that they cannot be transferred  or given to any other person to use. Grounds passes found to be used in any other  manner than that for which they were intended will be confiscated by security  personnel.  11. It is the responsibility of all passholders to ensure that their grounds passes are  valid. Expired passes will be replaced by the Pass and Identification Unit of the  Security and Safety Service upon presentation of an application signed by an  authorized signatory.  12. Staff members who arrive without their grounds passes (if forgotten at home)  will be directed to the Pass and Identification Unit to obtain a day pass once it has  been verified that said staff member has a valid grounds pass in the Unit system.   13. Please be aware that all packages brought to the premises at all entry points will  undergo a security inspection. Staff members and other United Nations-accredited  personnel are therefore discouraged from bringing unnecessary packages to the  premises during this period.  14. For all government delegations (Member States or observers), grounds passes  will be issued at the office of the Pass and Identification Unit. National security  officers accompanying Heads of State or Government who have queries regarding  ground passes should contact Captain Eric Bramwell of the Special Services Unit at  212 963 7531.  15. Access to the United Nations premises will be denied to anyone who is not on  the designated list of passholders authorized to be present during the high-level  period.   16. Questions or concerns regarding security arrangements should be directed to the  Chief of the Security and Safety Service, United Nations Headquarters, Michael  Browne, by contacting the Security Events Planning Unit (Captain Charlene Wilson)  at 212 963 7028 or Special Operations (Inspector Bernard Robinson) at 212 963 7531.        III. Operating hours of pedestrian access gates during the  high-level period       17. The opening hours of the pedestrian entrances are as follows:     42nd Street and First Avenue:  Open 24 hours     (Closed on 26 September)  46th Street and First Avenue:  6 a.m. to close of business     (Closed on 26 September)        IV. Admission of non-United Nations personnel      18. Outside messengers, family members, visitors and guests are restricted from  entering the Headquarters premises during the period of the general debate. The  resumption of such visits will be announced at a later date.   19. Access to the United Nations complex during the high-level meetings will be  restricted to delegates and their staff; staff members of the United Nations Secretariat  and of the funds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations system; accredited  media; and affiliates who have been issued with a United Nations grounds pass.  ST/IC/2021/12      21-12722  4/9      V. Closure of First Avenue and pedestrian crossing points      20. Owing to the heightened security measures throughout New York City and at  Headquarters, it is anticipated that from Sunday, 19 September 2021, to Saturday,  25 September 2021, the area in front of the United Nations along First Avenue, from  42nd Street to 48th Street, will be closed to all vehicular traffic with the exception of  escorted motorcades. As conditions permit, this restriction may be eased by the host  country law enforcement authorities.  21. Pedestrian crossing points at 42nd, 46th and 49th Streets will be accessible upon  presentation of a valid United Nations grounds pass and will be briefly suspended at  various times throughout the day owing to the arrival and departure of motorcades.  Therefore, all are kindly requested to allow for extra time when walking to the  Headquarters premises.        VI. Escorted motorcade drop-off       22. Escorted motorcades will be authorized to enter the United Nations premises at  the 43rd Street and First Avenue vehicular entrance and drop off their passengers at  the delegates' arrival tent. Thereafter, they will be required to exit the premises  through the 45th Street and First Avenue gate. All escorted motorcade movements on  the premises will be established by the Security and Safety Service and coordinated  in conjunction with the host country.        VII. Unescorted motorcade drop-off       23. Unescorted vehicles will be allowed to drop off passengers at the 46th Street  and First Avenue crossing point. A valid grounds pass and an authorized United  Nations e-tag (""UNGA76"", issued by the Garage Administration) will be required for  presentation at the 46th Street and Second Avenue vehicle checkpoint prior to access  being granted.        VIII. Access at the 42nd, 45th and 46th Street entrances      24. Staff members, including those holding only the United Nations laissez-passer,  affiliates, and resident correspondents (without equipment) with authorized access to  the Headquarters premises and who have business in the Secretariat Building,  authorized areas of the South Annex Building or the Dag Hammarskjold Library  Building, should continue to use the 42nd Street staff entrance.   25. Interns required for essential work in the Secretariat Building during the period  of heightened security should also use the 42nd Street staff entrance.   26. Senior United Nations officials holding a gold-coloured grounds pass, who will  enter at the 46th Street entrance, are requested to use the crossing point at 46th Street.   27. Staff members, and affiliates who possess a valid United Nations grounds pass,  along with the relevant secondary special event ticket (specific to a particular  meeting, date, time and room) issued by the sponsor of the event, will be subject to  screening prior to accessing the General Assembly and Conference Buildings and will  be required to use the entrance at 46th Street.   28. If difficulties are encountered in gaining access through any of the crossing  points staffed by the host country authorities and leading to the Headquarters premises  or any of the annex buildings that fall within the cordoned-off areas, assistance should    ST/IC/2021/12    5/9  21-12722    be sought from United Nations security personnel assigned to the crossing points.  Further assistance can be obtained at the information and reception desk, which has  been temporarily relocated to the lobby of the UNITAR Building.   29. The 46th Street entrance will be used by media as well as resident  correspondents with equipment.   30. Pedestrian entrances will be closed on Sunday, 26 September 2021. Staff  members requiring access to the Secretariat Building on that date can use the  pedestrian gate adjacent to the vehicular entrance at First Avenue and 43rd Street.   31. The delegates' entrance on 45th Street will be open only for egress of escorted  motorcades.         IX. Access to restricted areas       32. During the high-level period, from 20 September to 1 October 2021, access to  restricted areas will be given only to those holding United Nations grounds passes  and the appropriate secondary access passes and/or special event tickets. Interns will  not be permitted access to restricted areas.   33. The bilateral meeting areas are located in the General Assembly lobby. Those  areas will be reserved for members of delegations and staff conducting official business  and will require secondary passes for access. Access will be given 15 minutes prior to  any scheduled bilateral meeting.   34. In order to facilitate access to room GA-200, a secondary access pass will be  issued through the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management  to those individuals whose duties or functions require their presence.

In the interest of ensuring the safety of all concerned, it is important to maintain  the integrity of grounds passes because of the access that they allow their holder. All  authorized pass holders are therefore reminded that their grounds passes are solely      * Expiration date of the present information circular: 17 September 2021.

"human resources","UNITED UNITED ST NATIONS NATIONS Secretariat ST/AI/404 19 May 1995 ADMINISTRATIVE INSTRUCTION To: Members of the staff From: The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management Subject: ASSIGNMENT TO AND RETURN FROM MISSION DETAIL* 1. The present administrative instruction contains procedures and guidelines governing assignment to and return from mission detail. The Organization's policy on the subject is set out in bulletin ST/SGB/277 of 19 May 1995. Personnel directive PD/3/81/Rev.1 of 4 April 1984 is hereby cancelled. 2. The assignment of staff members to mission service and their reassignment back in their parent duty stations are issues of human resources management that have acquired special importance in the context of the exceptional growth in United Nations peace-keeping and related field operations. With this in mind, a review has been undertaken to ensure that policies and procedures concerning mission assignment reflect the overall objectives of the Organization and the legitimate concerns of the staff. The outcome of this review is being translated into a series of administrative instructions, of which the present document is the first. 3. The primary objective of the United Nations in the context of assignment to and return from mission service is to have its field operations staffed with the most competent and committed personnel whose values and expectations are congruent with those of the Organization. That objective is implemented through the selection process. As the selection process is currently being reviewed, a circular outlining the process will be issued once the review is completed. The Secretary-General is highly committed to having staff integrate mission service into their personal growth. He therefore expects programme managers to encourage their staff to serve on mission through staff rotation, and through * Personnel Manual index No. 4540. 95-15020 (E) 240595 /... ST/AI/404 Page 2 that rotation to further the careers of both their staff on detail and the staff who remain in their department/office by giving them the opportunity to take up new responsibilities. 4. The high demand for staff to be released for mission service has placed a significant burden on departments and offices away from Headquarters, and more so in view of the unpredictability of the duration of the mandates. For staff members, mission service is an opportunity to acquire additional experience, thus rendering the professional life of an international civil servant more complete, as well as to acquire further skills, as they are often called upon to function at higher levels in a work system more flexible than that of the established environment of their parent duty stations. 5. It is in this context that modifications to the existing policy of mission detail are addressed in the present administrative instruction in terms of: (a) Assignment to and blocking of posts of staff members on mission detail; (b) Mission replacement; (c) Training and preparing staff for mission assignment; (d) Debriefing and reintegration of staff returning from mission service. 6. It should be emphasized that mission detail, as any other assignment in the Organization, is at the discretion of the Secretary-General, as provided in staff regulation 1.2, which states: ""Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to assignment by him to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations."" In this respect, all internationally recruited staff members can be assigned to missions as deemed necessary by the Secretary-General. At the same time, without prejudice to this tenet, voluntary service on mission is encouraged and preferred. The Organization's policy is thus to invite qualified candidates to volunteer for mission service, and to encourage parent departments/offices to release such qualified staff subject to the guidelines detailed in paragraphs 7 to 9 below. Selection for mission service is made in the light of the needs of the mission concerned, with due regard to performance, potential, necessary skills and suitable experience. Selection is not an entitlement in any sense or form. 7. Consistent with the intent of paragraph 6 above, it is most important that staff in the Professional and General Service and related categories proceeding on mission detail be assured that they can return to their current post. Accordingly, for a period of up to two years, in conjunction with a staff member's mission assignment, releasing departments/offices are responsible for ensuring that the posts of detailed staff members holding permanent or long-term appointments are blocked. These posts are to be filled only through temporary recruitment of replacement staff, if necessary, or through temporary staff redeployment (including a special post allowance, when called for). If it is proposed that the mission detail be extended beyond two years, it will not be possible to grant any extension unless there is a specific written agreement to continue blocking the post in the parent department. The implementation of this agreement will be monitored by the Office of Human Resources Management. /... ST/AI/404 Page 3 8. Staff whose fixed-term appointment will expire during the period of detail may be extended until the expected end of the detail, but mission service does not of itself create an expectancy of renewal. Staff on fixed-term appointment who wish to go on mission should discuss the matter of their return with the releasing department, which will determine in writing whether it can undertake to reabsorb them depending on the needs of the service. 9. The demand for qualified staff to serve on field missions has placed a significant burden on departments and on the staff who remain, who must continue to maintain and even enhance productivity in programme delivery. It is for this reason that departments cannot be expected to block posts for more than two years when permanent staff members proceed on mission detail. Every effort will be made to balance their needs with those of the special mission and of the Organization as a whole. With this in mind, in order to begin building a system of mission rotation that will meet the needs of both programme managers and the staff, it has been decided to set an 8 to 10 per cent ceiling as a guideline in determining the percentage of staff that a department or office is expected to release for mission service. Within that ceiling programme managers are expected to ensure equitable opportunities for the release of their staff for mission service. Once a department/office has reached this ceiling, the department/office would not be expected to release additional staff until a corresponding number of staff have returned. This will serve to facilitate the release of staff for both long-term and short-term assignments and will, in turn, give more staff an opportunity to benefit systematically from the assignment. It would also ensure that programme managers will continue to have committed and competent staff carrying out the programmes that have been entrusted to them. 10. The Office of Human Resources Management and the Department of Peace-keeping Operations are developing an intensive training programme for staff undertaking core administrative functions in field missions. This programme includes two weeks of classroom instruction on United Nations peace-keeping operations and areas of specialization, followed by two and a half months of on-the-job training. 11. In order better to prepare staff and, when appropriate, their families for mission service, counselling sessions dealing with stress management are also being developed. Lessons learned from the present pilot training programme and the further development of relevant counselling sessions will serve as a basis for the issuance of an administrative instruction on the subject of training and counselling for mission service. 12. Debriefing procedures in situ are also an important tool that can assist in both planning for future missions and the reintegration of staff members to life and work at the parent duty station. Such procedures will be established as soon as possible, and will be communicated in an administrative instruction on the subject of debriefing of staff returning from mission detail. ----- "

Field Central Review Panels will also provide advice on the recommendations for  selection of staff to vacancy-specific job openings up to and including the FS-5 level  in peacekeeping operations and special political missions.   2.7 Peacekeeping and special political missions may establish Local Review Panels  to review and provide advice on recommendations of candidates for all levels of the  General Service and related categories, including but not limited to National  Professional Officers, who may be subsequently selected for vacancy-specific job  openings or for inclusion in local rosters. The composition and functions of such a  body shall, to the greatest possible extent, be governed by the provisions contained  in sections 3 and 4 of the present bulletin. The Department of Operational Support  will provide guidance to peacekeeping operations and special political missions on  the establishment of Local Review Panels.  2.8 Heads of entities1 who have been delegated authority to appoint, select and  promote staff up to the D-1 level for service limited to the entity concerned may  establish a special joint body to advise them in the exercise of their authority.

Alternatively, heads of entities who have been delegated authority to appoint, select  and promote staff up to the D-1 level for service limited to the entity concerned may  opt for the full application of the system for upcoming job openings, in which case  the appointment of the individual selected as a result would not, or would no longer,  be limited to service with the entity concerned. Should the head of entity exercise this  option, the case would be considered by the relevant central review body established  pursuant to sections 2.1 to 2.7, but would be referred back to the head of entity if that  body found that the evaluation criteria had not been properly applied and/or that the  __________________    1 In accordance with footnote 1 of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2019/2, entitled  ""Delegation of authority in the administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the  Financial Regulations and Rules"", ""head of entity"" means the head of a department or an office,  including an office away from Headquarters; the head of a special political or peacekeeping  mission; the head of a regional commission; a resident or regional coordinator; or the head of  any other unit tasked with programmed activities.

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members of a diplomatic  note received from the United States Mission to the United Nations on a change in  practice regarding the cancellation of valid United States visas in the ""G"" category  upon completion of assignment in the United States of America (see annex).  2.  The practice of the United States Mission of collecting passports of staff  members and/or dependants and household employees for visa cancellation upon  completion of assignment in the United States has been discontinued.   3.  Staff members, their dependants and household employees with ""G"" visas  valid for periods extending beyond the staff member's assignment with the United  Nations are not eligible to remain in the United States and must leave the country or  seek a change and/or adjustment of status within 30 days of their separation date.  4.  Separating staff members and/or dependants and household employees with  ""G"" visas must abide by the terms and conditions of their admission and comply  with the departure procedures. Unauthorized use of a valid United States visa issued  for an assignment with the United Nations is a violation of United States law.          * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2015/16      15-14313  2/2    Annex       Diplomatic note dated 16 July 2015 from the United States Mission  to the United Nations         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations and has the honour to refer to a change in practice regarding the  cancellation of valid United States visas in the ""G"" category upon completion of  assignment in the United States.    Previously, the United States Mission had requested that passports of staff  and/or dependants should be provided upon completion of assignment for visa  cancellation. At this time, passports containing valid United States ""G"" visas issued  to staff and their dependants, including domestic workers, should not be submitted  for visa cancellation to the Mission. Although most ""G"" visas are issued with  extended periods of validity, employees, dependants and domestic workers who  hold such visas are not eligible to remain in the United States on those visas upon  completion of their assignment with the United Nations and must depart from the  United States or seek a change and/or adjustment of status within 30 days of their  separation date.    The United States Mission recalls that separated employees, their dependants  and domestic workers are expected to abide by the terms and conditions of their  admission and to comply with the departure procedures. Unauthorized use of a valid  United States visa issued for an assignment with the United Nations is a violation of  United States law. ""G"" visas should not be used to enter the United States for  purposes unrelated to activities associated with a designated international  organization. In such cases, violators may be subject to removal.    "

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members holding a G-4  visa of a diplomatic note received from the Permanent Mission of the United States  of America to the United Nations regarding changes to the I-94 form  (arrival/departure record) and their effect on United Nations staff and their  dependents (see annex).  2.  For the purpose of streamlining the admissions process for individuals  lawfully entering the United States, the I-94 form will be automated. The  automation at ports of entry in the New York area entered into effect on 7 May 2013.  The overall purpose and contents of the I-94 form remain the same. The Host  Country Affairs Section of the Mission continues to require the hard copy of the   I-94 form of all individuals (including staff members, dependents and consultants)  for processing the renewal of G-4 visas and any other G-4 visa-related processes.  The I-94 form is available and can be printed from www.cbp.gov/I94. Applicants  need to submit the form together with their passport and other pertinent  documentation to the Travel and Transportation Section of the United Nations for  processing.  3.  Staff members are advised to familiarize themselves and are required to  comply with the details set out in the annex to the present circular. Additional  information will also be available from the Travel and Transportation Section web  page on iSeek.          * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.

The Customs and Border Protection of the United States recently announced  that the I-94 form will be automated to streamline the admissions process for  individuals lawfully visiting the United States. The overall purpose and contents of  the form, which provides international visitors with evidence that they have been  lawfully admitted to the United States, will remain unchanged. Customs and Border  Protection will start implementing the automation of the form at ports of entry in the  New York area on 7 May 2013.    The Host Country Affairs Section of the Mission will, nonetheless, continue to  require the hard copy of the I-94 form (available from www.cbp.gov/I94) from all  United Nations staff and dependents. United Nations staff should print the form  following the instructions provided on the Customs and Border Protection website  and provide it -- with their passport and other pertinent documentation -- to the  Travel and Transportation Section of the United Nations for processing. United  Nations staff who have an incorrect, lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed I-94 form  issued before automation came into effect may contact the Mission for assistance.    "

As set out in the instruction, travel undertaken without  medical clearance, when such clearance is required, may lead to the exclusion of  claims for compensation under article 2.3 (a) of appendix D to the Staff Rules.

Contracting of former and retired staff members    3.7 A former or retired staff member may be engaged on an individual contract  subject to the following provisions:     (a)  A minimum of a one-month break is applied between separation or  retirement of the former or retired staff member and reengagement on an individual  contract, unless the separation was on mutually agreed terms, in which case the  former staff member may be reengaged on an individual contract only after a period  of 36 months from the date of separation from service;    (b)  The former or retired staff member is not reengaged to perform the  functions of the same post from which he or she separated or retired or contracted to  encumber the position from which he or she separated or retired;    (c)  The former staff member did not separate from the United Nations or  another organization of the United Nations common system for any of the following  reasons: abandonment of post, misconduct, dismissal, non-renewal or termination of  appointment for unsatisfactory service, and/or resignation in lieu of disciplinary  action;    (d)  There are no other qualified and readily available candidates to perform  the required functions, and the engagement of the former or retired staff member  with the Secretariat will not adversely affect the career development opportunities  of existing staff members.  3.8 The reengagement of a former or retired staff member is subject to clearance  by the Office of Human Resources Management.  3.9 The fees payable to a former staff member shall not be based on the level of  remuneration that he or she held before separation, but rather on the nature and  complexity of the assignment performed, subject to the limitations specified in  section 3.10 below.  3.10 The contracting of a retired staff member who is in receipt of a benefit from  the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, is subject to the following restrictions:  ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  4/28      (a)  He or she may not be hired for more than six months per calendar year;    (b)  He or she may not receive more than $22,0001 per calendar year in  emoluments from the United Nations common system (calculated as the gross  amount of the fee, but not including travel and daily subsistence allowance  payments);2    (c)  He or she may not be contracted at a higher equivalent level than that at  which he or she separated from the organization concerned.

Contracting of staff members on special leave    3.14 Staff members on special leave without pay remain staff members and,  therefore, may not be engaged on individual contracts at their original or any other  duty station or department, office or mission.        Restrictions on reemployment as a staff member    3.15 In accordance with section III.B, paragraph 26, of General Assembly  resolution 51/226, the offices responsible for the processing of the individual  contracts are required to inform the consultants and individual contractors that they  are not eligible to apply for or be appointed to any position in the Professional and  higher categories and for positions at the FS-6 and FS-7 levels in the Field Service  category within six months of the end of their current or most recent service. For  such positions, at least six months need to have elapsed between the end of an  individual contract and the time of application and consideration for an appointment  as a staff member under the Staff Rules and Regulations of the United Nations.    __________________    1  In the case of former language staff engaged for language functions, the monetary equivalent of  125 days for work performed and/or services provided during a calendar year. The applicable  amount will be published.    2 This ceiling amount is subject to periodic adjustments that will be promulgated accordingly.    ST/AI/2013/4   5/28  13-62762        Section 4      Selection process    4.1 Rosters of consultants and individual contractors should be utilized where  available, as they provide easy access to a screened pool of individuals with a  relevant track record. Candidates maintained on any roster should be screened for  qualifications, references and prior work experience. Owing to the particular needs  of the various offices of the Secretariat, every department, office and mission is  required to develop its own roster of consultants and individual contractors based on  its requirements. Executive, administrative or human resources offices shall start  developing these rosters through the appropriate openings in the electronic platform  provided for this purpose by the Office of Human Resources Management and shall  keep them centrally in the department, office or mission, including for monitoring  and audit purposes.  4.2 When the services of a consultant or individual contractor are needed for more  than six months, an opening shall be posted in the electronic platform provided for  this purpose for a minimum of seven working days by the department, office or  mission.  4.3 In the process of selecting a consultant or individual contractor, heads of  departments, offices and missions are responsible for instituting competitive  selection procedures. The competitive selection procedure can take several forms,  including the evaluation of individuals identified from a roster of qualified  individuals maintained by the executive, administrative or human resources offices,  through the issuance of a consultancy or individual contractor opening in the  electronic platform provided for this purpose, through the department, office or  mission website or through any other appropriate means. For each assignment, every  effort shall be made to shortlist for consideration a minimum of three candidates  from the widest possible geographical basis. Travel costs may be considered but  may not distort the geographical balance in the awarding of contracts.  4.4 In order to ensure that all required information on candidates is on file, all  consultants and individual contractors, including former staff members and retirees,  are required to complete an application form as stipulated by the Secretariat,  regardless of whether they have submitted a curriculum vitae for consideration.  4.5 In the final selection, careful scrutiny of the terms of reference, the  competitive cost and the quality of work, as well as the qualifications,  competencies, expertise and experience of all suitable candidates and any potential  conflict of interest, should be taken into account. The final selection shall be based  on pre-established evaluation criteria.  4.6 A technical evaluation report must be attached to the contract on file, showing  the applicants reviewed and the basis on which the successful candidate was  selected (see annex V).        Exceptions to the competitive selection process requirement    4.7 On an exceptional basis, the head of department, office or mission may engage  a consultant or individual contractor even though he or she was the only candidate  considered, provided a reasoned and documented justification for such exception is  recorded prior to the selection.    ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  6/28        Verification of credentials, qualifications and experience    4.8 Prior to the issuance of a contract, the processing department, office or mission  shall verify the academic and professional credentials of the candidate recommended  for selection by conducting appropriate reference checks. For that purpose, the  requesting official shall submit contract proposals sufficiently in advance of starting  dates to allow for the completion of the verification requirements.        Certification of good health    4.9 Before commencing work, a consultant or individual contractor shall submit a  statement of good health and take full responsibility for the accuracy of that  statement, including confirmation that he or she has been informed of the  inoculations required for the country or countries to which travel is authorized.

No certificate of good health is required  when the consultant or individual contractor works solely from home for less than  30 days.  4.10 Consultants and individual contractors who are required to travel beyond  commuting distance to any duty station(s) with a hardship classification other than  H and A shall also certify that their medical or health insurance covers medical  evacuations and treatment.

Legal status    5.4 Consultants and individual contractors serve in their individual capacity and  not as representatives of a Government or of any other authority external to the  United Nations. They are neither staff members under the Staff Rules and Staff  Regulations of the United Nations nor officials for the purpose of the Convention on  the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 13 February 1946. Consultants  and individual contractors may be afforded the status of experts on mission within the  meaning of article VI, section 22, of the Convention. If the consultants and individual  contractors are required to travel on behalf of the United Nations, they may be given  a United Nations certificate in accordance with article VII, section 26, of the  Convention.

During the period of  their service for the Secretariat, consultants and individual contractors shall refrain  from any conduct that would adversely reflect on the United Nations and shall not  engage in any activity that is incompatible with the aims and objectives of the  Organization. They are required to strictly adhere to the Secretariat policies on  prohibition of harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority, the provisions  of the Secretary-General's bulletin on special measures for protection from sexual  exploitation and sexual abuse (ST/SGB/2003/13) and other policies and instructions  relating to proper conduct in the Secretariat.  5.6 Consultants and individual contractors shall exercise the utmost discretion in  all matters relating to the discharge of their functions. Unless otherwise authorized  by the appropriate official in the department, office or mission concerned,  consultants and individual contractors may not communicate at any time to the  media or to any institution, person, Government or other external authority any  information that has not been made public and that has become known to them by  reason of their association with the Secretariat. Consultants and individual  contractors may not use such information without the written authorization of the  Organization. These obligations do not lapse upon cessation of their service with the  United Nations.        Duration of contract     5.7 The duration of the contract shall be directly linked to the terms of reference  as set out in the consultant's or individual contractor's contract.   5.8 In order to limit the repeated use of the same consultant, either to perform  different tasks within the workplan or a series of tasks within the same project, no  consultant shall provide services for more than 24 months in a 36-month period,  whether continuous or not, and irrespective of the cumulative months of actual  work.   5.9 The services of an individual contractor shall be limited to 6 or, in special  circumstances, 9 work-months in any period of 12 consecutive months, irrespective  of the cumulative months of actual work, save for individual contractors engaged to  perform language functions on a unit-cost basis.         Work permits and related authorizations    5.10 For internationally recruited consultants or individual contractors, who are  required by the nature of their assignment to work in a country other than their own  country of permanent residence, the Organization, at its own expense, will assist the  consultant or individual contractor in obtaining the necessary visas and/or work  permits.  5.11 Locally recruited consultants or individual contractors, if serving in a duty  station outside their country of nationality, are responsible for all necessary visas  and work permits required by local authorities before commencing their assignment  with the Organization.  ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  8/28        Remuneration    5.12 As a general principle, the fees payable to a consultant or individual contractor  shall be the minimum amount necessary to obtain the services required by the  Organization.   5.13 If deemed necessary, the department, office or mission may indicate the  approximate expected fee levels in their request or advertisement, which shall be  guided by applicable market rates for the type, quality and volume of services  required. To the extent possible, such fee levels should be discussed with other  United Nations entities at the duty station. Amounts paid in connection with travel  undertaken by the consultant in accordance with sections 5.26 and 5.27 below shall  not be taken into account for remuneration purposes.   5.14 Heads of department, office or mission shall keep records of how the fee level  was determined.   5.15 Detailed policy guidelines and formulas for the determination of the appropriate  level of remuneration are provided in annex III to the present instruction.         Leave    5.16 Consultants and individual contractors shall not be entitled to any paid leave,  including annual leave, sick leave, special leave or official holidays. The fees of  consultants and individual contractors, other than those paid on the basis of a lump  sum, shall be prorated for any period of absence.        Payment    5.17 Fee advances. In general, fee advances for all individual contracts shall not be  granted. However, a maximum of 30 per cent of the total contract value may be  authorized by Heads of department or office in cases where advance purchases, for  example for supplies or travel, may be necessary.   5.18 Instalments. In cases where the payment of fees is made in instalments, the  final instalment may not be less than 10 per cent of the total value of the contract  and will be payable only upon satisfactory completion of the services and the  manager's certification thereof. The payment of instalments should be directly  linked with satisfactory deliverables at specific time intervals, as certified by the  manager.  5.19 Unsatisfactory or incomplete deliverables. The payment of fees is subject to  the satisfactory completion of services and the Secretariat's certification to that  effect, at the appropriate milestones (see sects. 5.29 to 5.33).         Taxes on income    5.20 The fees of consultants and individual contractors are expressed in gross  amounts. Consultants and individual contractors are responsible for determining  their tax liabilities and for the payment of any taxes and/or duties, in accordance  with local laws. The United Nations does not reimburse consultants or individual  contractors for any taxes, duty or other contribution payable by the consultants or  individual contractors on payments made under the individual contract. The United  Nations does not issue statements of earnings to consultants and individual  contractors.

Where appropriate, they may be paid travel expenses, including daily subsistence  allowance, in accordance with sections 5.26 and 5.27 below.         Life and health insurance    5.22 The United Nations does not provide or arrange life or health insurance  coverage for consultants and individual contractors, and consultants and individual  contractors are not eligible to participate in the life and health insurance schemes  provided by the United Nations for its staff members.

The responsibility of the  United Nations is limited solely to the payment of compensation for service- incurred death, injury or illness in accordance with section 5.24.        Compensation for service-incurred death, injury or illness    5.24 Consultants and individual contractors, or their dependants as appropriate, who  are authorized to travel at United Nations expense or who are required under their  contract to perform services in a United Nations office shall be entitled in the event  of death, injury or illness attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of  the United Nations to compensation equivalent to that provided under appendix D to  the Staff Rules (ST/SGB/Staff Rules/Appendix D/Rev.1 and Amend.1; see annex I,   art. 5).

If output is evaluated  as less than fully satisfactory, no further contracts shall be granted to the consultant  or individual contractor, and payments may be reduced or withheld entirely (see   sect. 5.19).   5.32 Requesting managers and officials approving individual contracts should  verify the performance record of the proposed consultant or individual contractor on  file for future engagement or the extension or renewal of his or her contract.  5.33 The Office of Human Resources Management shall have the authority to take a  final decision on whether further contracts should be awarded in the case of an  unsatisfactory output evaluation by the direct supervisor.         Termination of contract     5.34 An individual contract may be terminated by the United Nations or by the  consultant or individual contractor in accordance with the General Conditions of  Contracts for the Services of Consultants and Individual Contractors (see annex I,  art. 13).   5.35 Unsatisfactory or incomplete output or failure to conform to the standards of  conduct set out in the present instruction shall lead to termination of service for  cause, without notice, at the initiative of the United Nations.

ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  12/28    Annex I       General Conditions of Contracts for the Services of  Consultants and Individual Contractors       1.  Legal status      The consultant or individual contractor (hereinafter called ""contractor"") shall  have the legal status of an independent contractor vis-a-vis the United Nations, and  shall not be regarded, for any purposes, as being either a staff member of the United  Nations, under the Staff Rules and Staff Regulations of the United Nations, or an  official of the United Nations, for purposes of the Convention on the Privileges and  Immunities of the United Nations, adopted by the General Assembly on 13 February  1946. Accordingly, nothing within or relating to the contract shall establish the  relationship of employer and employee, or of principal and agent, between the  United Nations and the contractor. The officials, representatives, employees or  subcontractors of the United Nations and of the contractor, if any, shall not be  considered in any respect as being the employees or agents of the other, and the  United Nations and the contractor shall be solely responsible for all claims arising  out of or relating to their engagement of such persons or entities.      2.  Standards of conduct        General      The contractor shall neither seek nor accept instructions from any authority  external to the United Nations in connection with the performance of his or her  obligations under the contract. Should any authority external to the United Nations  seek to impose any instructions on the contractor regarding the contractor's  performance under the contract, the contractor shall promptly notify the United  Nations and shall provide all reasonable assistance required by the United Nations.  The contractor shall not take any action in respect of his or her performance of the  contract or otherwise related to his or her obligations under the contract that may  adversely affect the interests of the United Nations, and the contractor shall perform  his or her obligations under the contract with fullest regard for the interests of the  United Nations. The contractor warrants that he or she has not offered and shall not  offer any direct or indirect benefit arising from or related to the performance of the  contract or the award thereof to any representative, official, employee or other agent  of the United Nations. The contractor shall comply with all laws, ordinances, rules  and regulations bearing upon the performance of his or her obligations under the  contract.        Prohibition of sexual exploitation and abuse      In the performance of the contract, the contractor shall comply with the  standards of conduct set forth in Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2003/13 of   9 October 2003, entitled ""Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation  and sexual abuse"". In particular, the contractor shall not engage in any conduct that  would constitute sexual exploitation or sexual abuse, as defined in that bulletin.    The contractor acknowledges and agrees that any breach of any of the  provisions herein shall constitute a breach of an essential term of the contract and,  in addition to any other legal rights or remedies available to any person, shall give    ST/AI/2013/4   13/28  13-62762    rise to grounds for termination of the contract. In addition, nothing herein shall limit  the right of the United Nations to refer any alleged breach of the foregoing  standards of conduct to the relevant national authorities for appropriate legal action.      3.  Title rights, copyrights, patents and other proprietary rights      Title to any equipment and supplies that may be furnished by the United  Nations to the contractor for the performance of any obligations under the contract  shall rest with the United Nations, and any such equipment shall be returned to the  United Nations at the conclusion of the contract or when no longer needed by the  contractor. Such equipment, when returned to the United Nations, shall be in the  same condition as when delivered to the contractor, subject to normal wear and tear,  and the contractor shall be liable to compensate the United Nations for any damage  or degradation of the equipment beyond normal wear and tear.    The United Nations shall be entitled to all intellectual property and other  proprietary rights, including but not limited to patents, copyrights and trademarks,  with regard to products, processes, inventions, ideas, know-how or documents and  other materials that the contractor has developed for the United Nations under the  contract and that bear a direct relation to or are produced, prepared or collected in  consequence of, or during the course of, the performance of the contract, and the  contractor acknowledges and agrees that such products, documents and other  materials constitute works made for hire for the United Nations. However, to the  extent that any such intellectual property or other proprietary rights consist of any  intellectual property or other proprietary rights of the contractor: (a) that pre-existed  the performance by the contractor of his or her obligations under the contract; or   (b) that the contractor may develop or acquire, or may have developed or acquired,  independently of the performance of his or her obligations under the contract, the  United Nations does not and shall not claim any ownership interest thereto, and the  contractor grants to the United Nations a perpetual licence to use such intellectual  property or other proprietary right solely for the purposes of and in accordance with  the requirements of the contract. At the request of the United Nations, the contractor  shall take all necessary steps, execute all necessary documents and, generally, assist  in securing such proprietary rights and transferring or licensing them to the United  Nations in compliance with the requirements of the applicable law and of the  contract. Subject to the foregoing provisions, all maps, drawings, photographs,  mosaics, plans, reports, estimates, recommendations, documents and other data  compiled or received by the contractor under the contract shall be the property of  the United Nations, shall be made available for use or inspection by the United  Nations at reasonable times and in reasonable places, shall be treated as confidential  and shall be delivered only to United Nations authorized officials upon completion  of work under the contract.      4.  Confidential nature of documents and information       Information and data that are considered proprietary by either the United  Nations or the contractor or that are delivered or disclosed by one of them  (""discloser"") to the other (""recipient"") during the course of performance of the  contract, and that is designated as confidential (""information""), shall be held in  confidence and shall be handled as follows: the recipient of such information shall  use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure, publication or dissemination of  the discloser's information as it uses with its own similar information that it does  ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  14/28    not wish to disclose, publish or disseminate, and the recipient may use the  discloser's information solely for the purpose for which it was disclosed. The  recipient may disclose confidential information to any other party with the  discloser's prior written consent, as well as to the recipient's employees, officials,  representatives and agents who have a need to know such confidential information  solely for purposes of performing obligations under the contract. Subject to and  without any waiver of the privileges and immunities of the United Nations, the  contractor may disclose information to the extent required by law, provided that the  contractor will give the United Nations sufficient prior notice of a request for the  disclosure of information in order to allow the United Nations to have a reasonable  opportunity to take protective measures or such other action as may be appropriate  before any such disclosure is made. The United Nations may disclose information to  the extent required pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations, resolutions or  regulations of the General Assembly or rules promulgated by the Secretary-General.  The recipient shall not be precluded from disclosing information that is obtained by  the recipient from a third party without restriction, is disclosed by the discloser to a  third party without any obligation of confidentiality, is previously known by the  recipient, or is developed at any time by the recipient completely independently of  any disclosures hereunder. These obligations and restrictions of confidentiality shall  be effective during the term of the contract, including any extension thereof, and,  unless otherwise provided in the contract, shall remain effective following any  termination of the contract.      5.  Travel, statement of good health and service-incurred death, injury or illness      If the contractor is required by the United Nations to travel beyond commuting  distance from the contractor's usual place of residence, such travel shall be at the  expense of the United Nations. In such cases, the travel expenses borne by the  United Nations shall not exceed the cost of travel by the least costly economy  service.    Prior to the commencement of the contractor's services in any offices or  premises of the United Nations or before engaging in any travel required by the  United Nations or connected with the performance of the contract, the contractor  shall submit a statement of good health and certify that he or she is in possession of  medical or health insurance during the period of the contractor's services. The  contractor shall provide such a statement of good health and certification of the  medical or health insurance as soon as practicable following the signature of the  individual contract. The contractor shall also certify that he or she possesses medical  or health insurance that includes medical treatment, and, if required to travel beyond  commuting distance to any duty station(s) with a hardship classification other than  H and A, the contractor shall certify that his or her medical or health insurance  covers medical evacuations and treatment. The contractor warrants the accuracy of  any such statement of good health, including but not limited to confirmation that the  contractor has been fully informed regarding the requirements for inoculations for  the country or countries to which travel may be authorized.     The contractor shall be responsible for assuming all costs that may be incurred  in relation to the statement of good health and medical or health insurance.    In the event of the death, injury or illness of the contractor which is  attributable to the performance of services on behalf of the United Nations under the    ST/AI/2013/4   15/28  13-62762    terms of the contract while the contractor is travelling at United Nations expense or  is performing any services under the contract in any offices or premises of the  United Nations, the contractor or the contractor's dependants, as appropriate, shall  be entitled to compensation equivalent to that provided under appendix D to the  Staff Rules (ST/SGB/Staff Rules/Appendix D/Rev.1 and Amend.1).      6.  Prohibition on assignment; modifications      The contractor may not assign, delegate, transfer, pledge or make any other  disposition of the Contract, of any part thereof, or of any of the rights, claims or  obligations under the contract except with the prior written authorization of the  United Nations, and any attempt to do so shall be null and void. The terms or  conditions of any supplemental undertakings, licences or other forms of agreement  concerning any goods or services to be provided under the contract shall not be  valid and enforceable against the United Nations or in any way constitute an  agreement by the United Nations thereto, unless any such undertakings, licences or  other forms of agreement are the subject of a valid written undertaking by the  United Nations.     No modification or change in the contract shall be valid and enforceable  against the United Nations unless provided by means of a valid written amendment  to the contract signed by the contractor and an authorized official or appropriate  contracting authority of the United Nations.      7.  Subcontractors      In the event that the contractor requires the services of subcontractors to  perform any obligations under the contract, the contractor shall obtain the prior  written approval of the United Nations for any such subcontractors. The United  Nations may, at its sole discretion, reject any proposed subcontractor or require such  subcontractor's removal without having to give any justification therefor, and such  rejection shall not entitle the contractor to claim any delays in the performance or to  assert any excuses for the non-performance of any of its obligations under the  contract. The contractor shall be solely responsible for all services and obligations  performed by its subcontractors. The terms of any subcontract shall be subject to  and shall be construed in a manner that is fully in accordance with all of the terms  and conditions of the contract.      8.  Use of the name, emblem or official seal of the United Nations      The contractor shall not advertise or otherwise make public for purposes of  commercial advantage or goodwill that it has a contractual relationship with the  United Nations; nor shall the contractor in any manner whatsoever use the name,  emblem or official seal of the United Nations or any abbreviation of the name of the  United Nations in connection with its business or otherwise without the written  permission of the United Nations.      9.  Indemnification      The contractor shall indemnify, defend and hold and save harmless the United  Nations and its officials, agents and employees from and against all suits,  proceedings, claims, demands, losses and liability of any kind or nature, including  but not limited to all litigation costs and expenses, attorney's fees, settlement  ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  16/28    payments and damages, based on, arising from or relating to: (a) allegations or  claims that the use by the United Nations of any patented device, any copyrighted  material or any other goods or services provided to the United Nations for its use  under the terms of the contract, in whole or in part, separately or in combination,  constitutes an infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual  property right of any third party; or (b) any acts or omissions of the contractor or of  any subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly employed by them in the  performance of the contract that give rise to legal liability to anyone not a party to  the contract, including, without limitation, claims and liability in the nature of a  claim for workers' compensation.       10.  Insurance      The contractor shall pay the United Nations promptly for all loss, destruction  or damage to the property of the United Nations caused by the contractor or of any  subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly employed by them in the performance  of the contract. The contractor shall be solely responsible for taking out and for  maintaining adequate insurance required to meet any of his or her obligations under  the contract, as well as for arranging, at the contractor's sole expense, such life,  health and other forms of insurance as the contractor may consider to be appropriate  to cover the period during which the contractor provides services under the contract.  The contractor acknowledges and agrees that none of the insurance arrangements  the contractor may make shall in any way be construed to limit the contractor's  liability arising under or relating to the contract.       11.  Encumbrances and liens      The contractor shall not cause or permit any lien, attachment or other  encumbrance by any person to be placed on file or to remain on file in any public  office or on file with the United Nations against any monies due to the contractor or  to become due for any work done or against any goods supplied or materials  furnished under the contract or by reason of any other claim or demand against the  contractor.      12.  Force majeure; other changes in conditions      In the event of and as soon as possible after the occurrence of any cause  constituting force majeure, the contractor shall give notice and full particulars in  writing to the United Nations of such occurrence or cause if the contractor is  thereby rendered unable, wholly or in part, to perform his or her obligations and  meet his or her responsibilities under the contract. The contractor shall also notify  the United Nations of any other changes in condition or the occurrence of any event  that interferes or threatens to interfere with his or her performance of the contract.  Not more than 15 days following the provision of such notice of force majeure or  other changes in condition or occurrence, the contractor shall also submit a  statement to the United Nations of estimated expenditures that will likely be  incurred for the duration of the change in condition or the event. Upon receipt of the  notice(s) required hereunder, the United Nations shall take such action as it  considers, at its sole discretion, to be appropriate or necessary in the circumstances,  including the granting to the contractor of a reasonable extension of time in which  to perform any obligations under the contract.    ST/AI/2013/4   17/28  13-62762      If the contractor is rendered permanently unable, wholly or in part, by reason  of force majeure to perform his or her obligations and meet his or her  responsibilities under the contract, the United Nations shall have the right to  suspend or terminate the contract on the same terms and conditions as provided for  below, under ""Termination"", except that the period of notice shall be five days  instead of any other period of notice. In any case, the United Nations shall be  entitled to consider the contractor permanently unable to perform his or her  obligations under the contract in the case of the contractor's suffering any period of  suspension in excess of 30 days.    Force majeure as used herein means any unforeseeable and irresistible act of  nature, any act of war (whether declared or not), invasion, revolution, insurrection  or any other acts of a similar nature or force, provided that such acts arise from  causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the contractor. The  contractor acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any obligations under the  contract that the contractor must perform in or for any areas in which the United  Nations is engaged in, preparing to engage in, or disengaging from any  peacekeeping, humanitarian or similar operations, any delay or failure to perform  such obligations arising from or relating to harsh conditions within such areas or to  any incidents of civil unrest occurring in such areas shall not, in and of itself,  constitute force majeure under the contract.      13.  Termination      Either party may terminate the contract, in whole or in part, upon giving  written notice to the other party. The period of notice shall be 5 days in the case of  contracts for a total period of less than two months and 14 days in the case of  contracts for a longer period. The initiation of conciliation or arbitral proceedings,  as provided below, shall not be deemed to be a cause for or otherwise to be in itself  a termination of the contract. The United Nations may, without prejudice to any  other right or remedy available to it, terminate the contract forthwith in the event  that: (a) the contractor is adjudged bankrupt, is liquidated or becomes insolvent,  applies for a moratorium or stay on any payment or repayment obligations, or  applies to be declared insolvent; (b) the contractor is granted a moratorium or a stay  or is declared insolvent; (c) the contractor makes an assignment for the benefit of  one or more of his or her creditors; (d) a receiver is appointed on account of the  insolvency of the contractor; (e) the contractor offers a settlement in lieu of  bankruptcy or receivership; or (f) the United Nations reasonably determines that the  contractor has become subject to a materially adverse change in his or her financial  condition that threatens to endanger or otherwise substantially affect the ability of  the contractor to perform any of his or her obligations under the contract.    In the event of any termination of the contract, upon receipt of notice of  termination by the United Nations, the contractor shall, except as may be directed  by the United Nations in the notice of termination or otherwise in writing: (a) take  immediate steps to bring the performance of any obligations under the contract to a  close in a prompt and orderly manner and, in doing so, reduce expenses to a  minimum; (b) refrain from undertaking any further or additional commitments under  the contract as of and following the date of receipt of such notice; (c) deliver all  completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information and other property  that, if the contract had been completed, would have been required to be furnished  to the United Nations thereunder; (d) complete performance of the work not  ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  18/28    terminated; and (e) take any other action that may be necessary, or that the United  Nations may direct in writing, for the protection and preservation of any property,  whether tangible or intangible, related to the contract that is in the possession of the  contractor and in which the United Nations has or may be reasonably expected to  acquire an interest.    In the event of any termination of the contract, the United Nations shall only  be liable to pay the contractor compensation on a pro rata basis for no more than the  actual amount of work performed to the satisfaction of the United Nations in  accordance with the requirements of the contract. Additional costs incurred by the  United Nations resulting from the termination of the contract by the contractor may  be withheld from any amount otherwise due to the contractor from the United Nations.      14.  Non-exclusivity      The United Nations shall have no obligation respecting, and no limitations on,  its right to obtain goods of the same kind, quality and quantity, or to obtain any  services of the kind described in the contract, from any other source at any time.      15.  Taxation      Article II, section 7, of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the  United Nations provides, inter alia, that the United Nations, including its subsidiary  organs, is exempt from all direct taxes, except charges for public utility services,  and is exempt from customs restrictions, duties and charges of a similar nature in  respect of articles imported or exported for its official use. In the event that any  governmental authority refuses to recognize the exemptions of the United Nations  from such taxes, restrictions, duties or charges, the contractor shall immediately  consult with the United Nations to determine a mutually acceptable procedure. The  United Nations shall have no liability for taxes, duty or other similar charges  payable by the contractor in respect of any amounts paid to the contractor under the  contract, and the contractor acknowledges that the United Nations will not issue any  statements of earnings to the contractor in respect of any such payments.      16.  Settlement of disputes    Amicable settlement. The United Nations and the contractor shall use their best  efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of the  contract or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof. Where the parties wish to  seek such an amicable settlement through conciliation, the conciliation shall take  place in accordance with the Conciliation Rules then obtaining of the United  Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), or according to  such other procedure as may be agreed between the parties in writing.  Arbitration. Any dispute, controversy or claim between the parties arising out of  the contract, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, unless settled amicably,  as provided above, shall be referred by either of the parties to arbitration in  accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules then obtaining. The decisions of  the arbitral tribunal shall be based on general principles of international commercial  law. For all evidentiary questions, the arbitral tribunal shall be guided by the  Supplementary Rules Governing the Presentation and Reception of Evidence in  International Commercial Arbitration of the International Bar Association, 28 May  1983 edition. The arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive    ST/AI/2013/4   19/28  13-62762    damages. In addition, the arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award interest  in excess of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate then prevailing, and any such  interest shall be simple interest only. The parties shall be bound by any arbitration  award rendered as a result of such arbitration as the final adjudication of any such  dispute, controversy or claim.      17.  Privileges and immunities      Nothing in or relating to the contract shall be deemed a waiver, express or  implied, of any of the privileges and immunities of the United Nations, including its  subsidiary organs.      ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  20/28    Annex II       Documentation to be provided to or by the consultant or  individual contractor        The following documents are to be provided to the consultant or individual  contractor, as appropriate:    (a)  The individual contract for signature, including the terms of reference;    (b)  A copy of the General Conditions of Contracts for the Services of  Consultants and Individual Contractors;    (c)  A copy of the Secretary-General's bulletin on special measures for  protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse (ST/SGB/2003/13);    (d)  A statement of good health for self-certification, including a reference to  applicable inoculations and the need for the individual to procure health insurance  coverage;    (e)  Where travel beyond commuting distance to any duty station(s) with a  hardship classification other than H and A is required, a letter requesting proof that  the medical or health insurance covers medical evacuations and treatment. All  consultants and individual contractors will have to confirm that they are responsible  for obtaining health insurance coverage at their own expense;    (f)  Where travel is involved, travel and ticketing information, including  travel authorization, as appropriate, as well as, where applicable, a security  clearance form (through the travel request information processing system) and/or an  application for a United Nations certificate;    (g)  Authorization for direct deposit form, detailing bank account and/or  similar information;    (h)  Designation, change or revocation of beneficiary form.        ST/AI/2013/4   21/28  13-62762    Annex III        Fee and remuneration levels for consultants and  individual contractors        A. General    1.  Subject to the overriding consideration of quality, as a rule the fees payable to  a consultant or individual contractor will be the minimum amount necessary to  obtain the services required by the Organization. Using the guidelines provided  below, duly authorized managers may negotiate and establish fees payable to a  consultant or individual contractor, provided the fees are within the scope of their  authority as outlined in the present instruction.  2.  In each office of the Organization, duly authorized officials, normally, an  Executive Officer or Administrative Officer, shall have the delegated authority to  assess and formally determine the level of remuneration for a proposed consultancy.        B. Determination      3.  An assignment under a consultant or individual contractor contract does not  carry with it a level or grade with respect to a United Nations salary scale.  Nonetheless, on the basis of the factors listed below, it should be possible to  estimate the United Nations common system equivalent of the level of the  assignment (e.g. P-3, P-4) to ensure equity and consistency of fees for consultants  and individual contractors. When setting the consultant's or individual contractor's  rate of pay, the following factors should be considered:    (a)  Level of work in terms of responsibilities and complexity of the  assignment;    (b)  Degree of specialization required by the assignment;     (c)  Knowledge, qualifications, experience and skills required;    (d)  Fees paid to the consultant for previous assignments with the Secretariat  (or other United Nations agency).  4.  Once the equivalent level of the assignment has been estimated, a fee range,  for the purpose of negotiating the contract with the consultant or individual  contractor, may then be determined within the minimum and maximum of the level  on the basis of the complexity of the assignment and the degree of specialization,  knowledge, qualifications, experience and skills required.        C. Fee range      5.  The fee range associated with a particular level of assignment is based on:  (a) the current gross annual salary scales (before application of staff assessment)  applicable to staff in the Professional and higher categories; (b) levels of expertise  and professional capacity linked to grades in the salary scale; and (c) special  circumstances, including hardship involved in the performance of the work  assignment.  ST/AI/2013/4      13-62762  22/28    6.  The following are the fee ranges:    Level A. This level is established for the engagement of support services not  available in the Organization related to projects or technical tasks of a narrow  scope for which limited technical skills or experience are required.    Level B. This level is typically used for projects of moderate complexity with  either broad scope or limited depth or restricted scope and considerable depth  that have an impact on the performance of systems, processes and team(s)  within the Organization. This level is typically used for individuals with a  specialized degree or training and several years of relevant experience in one  of the substantive, technical and/or administrative fields of the Organization.    Level C. This level shall be authorized to engage an individual with extensive  relevant professional experience requiring specialized or technical knowledge  and skills. Individuals at this level will be expected to develop new  approaches, techniques or policies and/or design guidelines, standard operating  procedures and a project's theme. Individuals would be engaged in projects of  broad scope and considerable depth that will have an impact on the overall  execution of programmes or service of a function or various interrelated areas.  Expected outputs of the consultancy at this level may relate, inter alia, to  providing technical support; leading group dynamics; and undertaking report  drafting or project-wide proposals.    Level D. This level shall be authorized to engage highly specialized  individuals with extensive relevant experience and the highest level of  expertise in the corresponding area of work or programme for which they are  engaged. The individual's services, work and recommendations, for example,  may form one of several contributions to the accomplishment of a crucial  programme or service or functional area of a broad scope, involving high  complexity and impact. Some of the expected deliverable outputs would  primarily relate to the following: providing functional leadership and expert  advice; preparing intricate and complex technical papers to working groups;  undertaking the drafting of reports or proposals for projects of a large scale or  a broad scope. The individual's assigned duties may relate to large-scale  programmatic and operational activities involving large commitments of staff  and funds.    Level E. This level can be authorized only by the Office of Human Resources  Management. The level is reserved for essentially very exceptional  arrangements related to services and work to be obtained from a well-known,  worldwide authority in a highly specialized area. Normally, these types of  engagements may result in programmatic and/or operational activities  involving either large commitments of staff and funds or an exceptionally  complex programmatic scope, which would carry a significant organizational  impact on delivery in terms of strategy, operational reengineering and planning  analytics, usually of an unusual complexity and/or sensitive nature. This level  would be aligned to the Assistant Secretary-General/Under-Secretary-General  levels or the equivalent ungraded levels for Chairs and Vice-Chairs or high- level representatives.  7.  Once the fee range is established, the monthly and daily fee rates are  calculated by the Office of Human Resources Management and the resulting figure    ST/AI/2013/4   23/28  13-62762    is rounded up to determine the minimum and maximum of the fee range. The fee  range is updated periodically in accordance with revisions of the salary scale for the  Professional and higher categories based on the annual gross base salaries.  8.

Section 5      Amount    5.1 For internationally recruited staff members in the Professional and higher  categories and in the Field Service category, a danger pay monthly global rate shall  be established by ICSC in accordance with its statute and is subject to periodic review  by the Commission.  5.2 For locally recruited staff members in the General Service and National  Professional Officer categories, a monthly amount of danger pay shall be established  by ICSC for each eligible duty station in accordance with its statute and shall be  subject to periodic review by the Commission.1  5.3 For eligible locally recruited staff members in the General Service and related  categories and in the National Professional Officer category on official business travel  to a location approved for danger pay that is located outside the country of  recruitment, danger pay shall be paid at the global rate referred to in section 5.1.        Section 6      Payment modality    6.1 Danger pay is payable to eligible staff members who are present in a location  approved for danger pay. Where a staff member assigned to a location approved for  danger pay resides in a different location that is not approved for danger pay, the  allowance will be payable only for the days that the staff member reports to work and  is present in the location approved for danger pay.  6.2 For staff members who spend one full calendar month in the location approved  for danger pay, the monthly amount is paid irrespective of the number of days in the  calendar month.  6.3 When a staff member is present at a location approved for danger pay for less  than one calendar month, the amount of danger pay is prorated on the basis of 365  days. The daily rate is calculated by dividing the annual amount by 365 days and  __________________    1 The determination by ICSC of the danger pay monthly amounts for locally recruited staff in the  General Service and National Professional Officer categories is based on the modality approved  by the General Assembly in its resolutions 66/235 A and 66/235 B. Further details are available  on the ICSC website (see https://icsc.un.org/Home/DataDangerPay).    ST/AI/2020/6    3/3  20-14099    multiplying the daily amount by the number of days physically spent at the location  and shall not exceed the monthly rate.  6.4 For internationally recruited staff assigned to a location approved for danger  pay, danger pay is payable for time away from the location on rest and recuperation  travel and official business travel up to a cumulative maximum of seven calendar days  in a calendar month, including weekends or official holidays.  6.5 Where staff members from a location which is not approved for danger pay are  on official business travel to a location approved for danger pay, and the staff  members avail themselves of rest and recuperation, danger pay up to a maximum of  seven calendar days on rest and recuperation is payable only if the staff members  return to and spend a minimum period of 30 calendar days in the location approved  for danger pay after completion of the period of rest and recuperation. Failure to  satisfy this requirement of 30 calendar days will result in recovery of any danger pay  amounts paid in connection with the rest and recuperation travel.  6.6 For locally recruited and, where applicable, internationally recruited staff  members, danger pay is payable while on maternity, paternity, annual or sick leave as  long as the staff member remains in the assigned location approved for danger pay.  Danger pay is also payable to locally recruited staff members for time away from the  location on official business travel up to a cumulative maximum of seven calendar  days in a calendar month, including weekends or official holidays.  6.7 Except as provided in sections 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6, danger pay is not payable for  any other days spent away from the location approved for danger pay.  6.8 Danger pay is payable for days of partial presence in connection with official  business travel at a location approved for danger pay. However, danger pay shall not  be claimed or paid more than once for the same calendar day (e.g., when both the  departure and the arrival locations are approved for danger pay, and the official travel  is completed within the same calendar day).        Section 7      Relationship to other entitlements    7.1 A staff member who is temporarily relocated or evacuated from a location  approved for danger pay to a location that is not approved for danger pay shall not be  eligible to receive danger pay while on relocation or evacuation status.  7.2 A staff member who is temporarily relocated or evacuated to a location  authorized by the Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security that is also  approved for danger pay may receive payment of both danger pay and the security  evacuation allowance or security relocation allowance, if applicable, provided that  the staff member is present in such location.        Section 8      Final provisions      The present administrative instruction shall enter into force on the date of its  issuance.

In the event that a doubt arises as to the relevant  data steward, the Chief Data Protection and Privacy Officer will identify the relevant  data steward for the purpose of handling the request.  17.11 The available method for filing a request through the centralized reporting  mechanism should normally be made public in the privacy notice included on United  Nations websites, as well as in any applicable data protection and privacy consent  forms pursuant to section 13 above.        Section 18       Determination by the data steward on requests concerning the processing of  personal data    18.1 The data steward will determine whether to accede to any request made under  section 17.  18.2 The data steward may ask for further details or substantiating evidence to enable  the making of such determination on the request.   18.3 The data steward shall deny a request and such denial will be without further  consideration or recourse if the content, use or means of the processing of data falls  outside the purview of the Secretariat (for example, when the content, use or means  of the processing of data is directly determined by the General Assembly, the Security  Council, the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice or any of  their subsidiary organs, including sanctions bodies, investigative bodies, accountability  mechanisms and criminal tribunals). Such denial is not subject to section 19 below.  18.4 The data steward may deny a request for the sole reason that it relates to the  processing of data for any of the following specified purposes:    (a)  The provision of legal advice;    (b)  The provision of mutual legal assistance or judicial cooperation to  Member States or international courts, tribunals or accountability mechanisms;  ST/SGB/2024/3      24-04902  12/13      (c)  Investigations concerning allegations of criminal conduct or other  misconduct, including fraud, corruption, conflicts of interest, sexual harassment,  sexual abuse or sexual exploitation;     (d)  Protection against retaliation;    (e)  The financial disclosure programme;    (f)  The advisory functions of the Ethics Office;    (g)  Internal audits, inspections and evaluations;    (h)  Fact-finding, monitoring or investigation activities conducted by the  Secretariat in relation to breaches of international human rights law or international  humanitarian law;    (i)  Fact-finding or investigation activities in relation to specific incidents  undertaken by boards of inquiry or other investigative or fact-finding bodies  established by or under the authority of the Secretary-General;    (j)  Any activities carried out by the Secretariat in its support of sanctions  bodies, investigative bodies, accountability mechanisms and criminal tribunals  established by the General Assembly, the Security Council or their subsidiary organs;    (k)  Ongoing or anticipated litigation before the United Nations Dispute  Tribunal or the United Nations Appeals Tribunal;     (l)  Otherwise where the United Nations has a duty of confidentiality in  respect of the information concerned.  18.5 Data stewards may accede to any request if they have determined, in their  discretion, that the requestor has demonstrated that such request is well founded and  if they have determined, in their discretion, that such request is consistent with the  applicable legal framework and is not abusive, fraudulent or too onerous to comply  with given existing resources, and that granting such request would not impair the  legal basis or the specific purpose of the data processing; does not impair the  execution of mandates of the Organization; would not jeopardize the security, privacy,  safety and health of individuals and groups; would not jeopardize other rights of  individuals and groups; and would not frustrate other overriding legitimate interests  of the United Nations.   18.6 The determination by the data steward of whether to accede to requests will be  communicated in writing to the requestor. Whenever possible and appropriate, the  reasons for denying a request will also be given.        Section 19       Review by the Data Protection and Privacy Committee    19.1 In cases of denial of a request by the data steward, in whole or in part, for  reasons other than those specified under section 18.3 above, the requestor may request  a review of such denial by the Data Protection and Privacy Committee by making  such request for review to the Chief Data Protection and Privacy Officer on a form  prescribed by the Chief Data Protection and Privacy Officer within 30 days following  receipt of the data steward's determination. The Chief Data Protection and Privacy  Officer may, for good cause shown by the requestor, extend this time limit.  19.2 The Data Protection and Privacy Committee will review the determination by  the data steward and make a recommendation to the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance regarding such request.     ST/SGB/2024/3    13/13  24-04902    19.3 On the basis of the recommendation received, the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will make a final decision on such  request.  19.4 Such final decision will be communicated in writing to the requestor and to the  data steward.  19.5 Where such final decision constitutes an administrative decision adversely  affecting the rights of a staff member and producing direct legal consequences in  relation to the terms of that person's employment as a staff member, the staff member  in question may have rights regarding such decision under article XI of the Staff  Regulations and chapter XI of the Staff Rules. In such cases, the Data Protection and  Privacy Committee constitutes a technical body within the meaning of Staff Rule  11.2. Accordingly, the decision by the Under-Secretary-General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance pursuant to section 19.3 above will not require  management evaluation.   19.6 In relation to requestors who are not staff members, a challenge to the decision  made by the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance on the request would be subject to such method of amicable resolution  and dispute settlement as determined by the Secretary-General under any contract  governing their relationship with the United Nations, or as set forth in a separate  administrative issuance.

"human resources","  United Nations    ST/SGB/2019/2      Secretariat      17 December 2018       18-21528 (E)    211218      *1821528*         Secretary-General's bulletin         Delegation of authority in the administration of the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules        The Secretary-General, for the purposes of decentralizing decision-making,  aligning authorities with responsibilities and strengthening accountability, and to  delegate to managers the necessary managerial authority over human, financial and  physical resources to allow for effective mandate delivery, promulgates the following:        Section 1      Establishment of the new framework for delegation of authority    1.1 The Secretary-General hereby rescinds all existing delegations of authority and  subdelegations of authority under the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial  Regulations and Rules issued to any official of the United Nations, other than the  executive heads of separately administered and funded subsidiary organs, institutions,  funds and programmes of the United Nations. The Secretary-General hereby  establishes the framework for the reissuance of new delegations of authority directly  to heads of entity1 to implement specified aspects of the Staff Regulations and Rules  and the Financial Regulations and Rules.   1.2 All delegations of authority, including any limitations, will be issued and  managed through an online portal, described below.   1.3 The matters reserved exclusively for the decision of the Secretary-General are  set out in the annexes to the present bulletin. Where authority over a matter is not  delegated, the matter is reserved for the decision of the Secretary-General.        Section 2      General principles of delegation (including subdelegation) of authority in the  administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial  Regulations and Rules    2.1 As the chief administrative officer of the Organization under the Charter of the  United Nations, the Secretary-General holds the primary authority and accountability  for the administration of the Staff Regulations and Rules and the Financial  __________________    1  ""Head of entity"" means the head of a department or an office, including an office away from  Headquarters; the head of a special political or peacekeeping mission; the head of a regional  commission; a resident or regional coordinator; or the head of any other unit tasked with  programmed activities.  ST/SGB/2019/2      18-21528  2/23    Regulations and Rules. The Secretary-General's authority may be delegated in  accordance with the principles and procedures set out in the present bulletin.  2.2 The annexes to the present bulletin set out the standard authorities that a head  of entity may receive, depending on the capacity of the entity to receive and  implement the delegations in a responsible and effective manner. The capacity of any  entity may change over time, and the assessment of that capacity and the appropriate  level of specific delegations of authority shall be the responsibility of the Under- Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation  with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support and the head of entity  concerned.  2.3 A core principle of delegation of authority is the delegation of centrally held  decision-making closer to the point of service delivery. The exercise of a delegated  authority is the taking of a decision within the authority delegated and is separate  from the execution of that decision, which may require a specific administrative  capacity. Delegation of authority should not lead to the creation of new duplicative  administrative capacities in entities which lack the structural capacity to execute  decisions. Consequently, where the head of entity has the capacity to take a decision  under delegated authority but the entity lacks the appropriate capacity to execute the  decision, another entity will be assigned by the Under-Secretary-General for  Operational Support, in consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for  Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the head of entity concerned, to  execute the decision on the entity's behalf as a service provider.  2.4 Where the Secretary-General has delegated the authority to administer the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules to heads of entity,  such delegation shall be understood to be on a functional, rather than personal, basis  unless the Secretary-General has expressly indicated otherwise.   2.5 All delegations of authority shall be made formally through the dedicated online  portal.2   The authorities delegated shall be clearly stated and accepted by both the  delegator and the delegatee, including that such delegation may be suspended,  amended or revoked as provided in section 4.4 below. The delegation should include  the description of the authority being delegated and any specific limitations imposed,  including but not limited to restrictions on further subdelegation and essential  segregations of duties where applicable. Delegatees shall inform themselves of the  delegation and the relevant regulations, rules, policies, practices and standards  applicable to any decision or action to be taken under the authority delegated and  cannot claim ignorance of such in defence of any decision or action taken in the  exercise of any delegated authority. The Department of Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance and the Department of Operational Support shall be available to  support delegatees in this regard.   2.6 When an officer-in-charge or an officer ad interim is assigned to a function, the  authorities of the official holding that function shall automatically be delegated on a  temporary basis to the officer-in-charge or the officer ad interim, unless otherwise  specified formally by the official who designated the officer-in-charge or the officer  ad interim.  2.7 A delegation of authority by the Secretary-General to a head of entity entails  personal responsibility for duly discharging the authority and personal accountability  for incorrectly applying or failing to correctly discharge the authority. On the advice  of the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance in  __________________    2  Where circumstances require delegation to be made outside the online portal, such delegation  shall be made in writing, with a copy provided to the Under-Secretary-General for Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance.    ST/SGB/2019/2    3/23  18-21528    consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support, the  Secretary-General has the discretion at any time to enquire about and to provide input  on the exercise of delegated authorities and to suspend, amend or withdraw the  delegated authorities, and any such resulting action shall be reflected in the online  portal.  2.8 Within an entity, delegated authority may be further delegated, unless such  further delegation has been excluded by the delegator in the delegation or  subdelegation. Delegators remain accountable and responsible for the exercise of  delegated authority that they subdelegate. Any such subdelegation should be along  reporting lines and on a functional and not a personal basis and therefore be consistent  with the anticipated responsibilities to be performed. The original delegator has the  discretion at any time to enquire about and to provide input on the exercise of  delegated authorities and to suspend, amend or withdraw the delegated authorities,  and any such resulting action shall also be reflected in the online portal.  2.9 A delegatee shall promptly and fully comply with all reporting requirements set  by the delegator and the Under-Secretaries-General for Management Strategy, Policy  and Compliance and for Operational Support.   2.10 Any staff member to whom authority is delegated or subdelegated, as the case  may be, in accordance with the present bulletin is accountable for exercising the  highest standards of professionalism and integrity in accordance with the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the standards of conduct for the international civil service.  The exercise of such authority shall be based on considered professional judgment,  in full conformity with the Staff Regulations and Rules, the Financial Regulation and  Rules, policies, practices and standards and overall interests of the Organization and  subject to the United Nations Secretariat accountability system. 3   2.11 For the purposes of the present bulletin, ""accountability"" is the obligation of  staff members to be answerable for all decisions made and actions taken by them, and  to be responsible for honouring their commitments, without qualification or  exception. Accountability includes achieving objectives and high-quality results in a  timely and cost-effective manner, in fully implementing and delivering on all  mandates to the Secretariat approved by the United Nations intergovernmental bodies  and other subsidiary organs established by them in compliance with all resolutions,  regulations, rules and ethical standards; truthful, objective, accurate and timely  reporting on performance results; responsible stewardship of funds and resources; all  aspects of performance, including a clearly defined system of rewards and sanctions;  and with due recognition to the important role of the oversight bodies and in full  compliance with accepted recommendations.        Section 3      Delegations of authority to be held centrally    3.1 The Secretary-General shall delegate certain authorities to be held and exercised  centrally by the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance or the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support for reasons  including oversight and assurance, coordination of inter-entity operational support  matters, and administration of human resources and physical assets shared between  Secretariat entities. In addition, the Under-Secretaries-General for Operational  Support and for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance may, in consultation  with each other, apply temporary exceptional measures for application in  extraordinary situations.  __________________    3  See A/64/640 and A/72/773.  ST/SGB/2019/2      18-21528  4/23    3.2 The authorities to be centrally held and exercised are set out in the annexes to  the present bulletin.         Section 4      Management of authorities delegated to heads of entity    4.1 Heads of entity will receive notification of their delegations of authority from  the Secretary-General and any actions relating to such delegations, such as  amendment, suspension or revocation, through the online portal. The heads of entity  will acknowledge receipt of the delegations to them in their capacity as head of entity  through the portal.   4.2 Through the online portal, the heads of entity will be provided with a description  of the authority being delegated and any specific limitations imposed, including but  not limited to restrictions on further subdelegation and essential segregations of duties  where applicable. Heads of entity will use the online portal to subdelegate authority  and shall be able to view all subdelegations within their entity.   4.3 The authorities delegated to heads of entity are specific to that function and are  not personal in nature. When heads of entity cease to hold the appointment for that  function, they will no longer hold or be able to exercise the authorities delegated to  that function. Pending the appointment of an officer-in-charge, an officer ad interim  or a replacement head of entity, all subdelegations will remain in effect. When the  head of entity is succeeded by another, the duly appointed successor will ordinarily  be afforded the same level of delegations as the predecessor and shall be notified of  and accept the delegations through the online portal. All subdelegations issued by the  predecessor shall remain valid, with the accountability transferring to the successor  unless otherwise withdrawn or modified by the successor.  4.4 The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance is responsible  for monitoring and evaluating compliance with the present bulletin, including  whether any circumstances have arisen that justify the suspension, amendment or  revocation of any delegation, in whole or in part; this may also result in the imposition  of administrative or disciplinary measures. Delegations of authority granted to a head  of entity may be suspended, amended or revoked at any time by the Secretary-General  on the advice of the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance in consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational  Support. The decision to suspend, amend or revoke (in whole or in part) the  authorities delegated to the heads of entity, including the reasons therefor, shall be  recorded through the online portal. A record of the decision and the reasons for such  action shall be maintained by the Department of Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance.   4.5 In the event that certain delegated authorities of the head of entity are  suspended, amended or revoked or otherwise revised pursuant to section 4.4, the  Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in  consultation with the Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support, shall make a  recommendation to the Secretary-General on which head of entity should exercise  those authorities until such time as the circumstances giving rise to the suspension,  amendment or revocation of the authorities no longer apply. Where appropriate, the  Department of Operational Support shall work with the entity concerned to enhance  its capability until the required capacity has been developed to the satisfaction of the  Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.   4.6 The Under-Secretaries-General for Management Strategy, Policy and  Compliance and for Operational Support shall be able to view all delegations and  subdelegations of authority made through the online portal.      ST/SGB/2019/2    5/23  18-21528        Section 5      Management of subdelegations of authority by the heads of entity    5.1 Within entities, the heads of entity shall subdelegate selected authorities vested  in them, in accordance with any limitation set out in the individual delegation of  authority, to their staff, aligning authorities with responsibilities while ensuring key  segregation of duties, to ensure the most effective and responsible use of the resources  under their authority to deliver their mandates. They should decide on the scope and  limit of the authorities to be delegated and the effective date of delegation. The further  delegation of authorities from the head of entity shall be made through the online  portal.  5.2 In circumstances where it is determined by the Department of Management  Strategy, Policy and Compliance, in consultation with the head of entity concerned,  that the mandate of that entity requires the subdelegation of specific authorities to the  head of another entity, such subdelegation shall be made through the online portal.   5.3 Authorities subdelegated by the head of entity may be suspended, amended or  revoked, in whole or in part, by the head of entity at any time when circumstances  have arisen that justify such action. The head of entity shall do so through the online  portal and shall communicate the reasons for such action in writing to the delegatee.  A record of the decision and reasons for such action shall be maintained by the head  of the human resources unit of the entity concerned.  5.4 Should there be any changes to the authorities delegated to the head of entity,  whether for policy reasons or to reflect a change in circumstances, the head of entity  shall ensure that concomitant changes are made to any subdelegations to align those  subdelegations with the revised authority vested in the head of entity. Such changes  shall be made through the online portal.         Section 6      Monitoring the exercise of delegated authority      The Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance will monitor  the use of delegated authority, including through the use of key performance  indicators, to ensure that the delegatees are complying with the applicable legal and  policy framework and internal controls.

General Provisions    1. The policy provisions governing the education grant and related benefits are contained in staff  regulation 3.2, staff rule 3.9, appendix B to the Staff Rules and administrative instruction  ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.1, ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.1/Amend.1 and ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.2. Staff members are strongly  encouraged to review the above-mentioned policy frameworks before submitting a claim for  payment or requesting an advance against the education grant and related benefits entitlement.    2. The purpose of this policy guideline is to inform staff members of the procedures applicable to the  submission and processing of their claims for payment and/or requests for advance.    3. The forms required to submit a claim and/or a request for advance are listed in annex I to this  guideline and are available online in the United Nations Policy Portal. The maximum amounts of  admissible educational expenses and maximum reimbursements currently in effect are contained in  ST/IC/2022/8.        II. Requests for advances for the education grant and related benefits     4. Staff members who are entitled to the education grant and related benefits and who are required  to pay all or a portion of the education fees at the beginning of the academic year may apply for  an advance against their entitlement. They should do so by completing form P.45/EG (Education  grant and related benefits: claim for payment and/or request for advance), which can be found in  the United Nations Policy Portal.    Amount of the first-time advance and subsequent advances     5. When an advance is requested for the first time, the request must be accompanied by invoices  or other official documentation from the educational institution attesting to the fees, including  enrolment, tuition and any scholarship, bursary or similar grant. Based on the information provided by  the educational institution, the amount of the advance will be 100 per cent of the anticipated  amount of the education grant and the related benefits (i.e., reimbursement of the capital  assessment fee and boarding assistance, where applicable).     6. For a subsequent school year, the advance will normally be 100 per cent of the anticipated  amount of the education grant expected for the year. In addition, an advance against boarding  assistance and the reimbursement of the capital assessment fee may be paid based on submitted  documentation. Official documentation will be required from the educational institution attesting to  the expenses for education grant and related benefits claimed.     Adjustments after the advance has been issued     1 Approved by DMSPC/OHR on 1 June 2022      OHR/PG/2022/1                                                                                                                                                                        2/7      7. If the anticipated admissible educational expenses on which the advance was based become  higher after the advance is requested, an adjustment may be requested as soon as the staff member  is informed of the higher charges. Should the anticipated admissible educational expenses become  lower, the staff member must report that fact promptly so that the amount of the advance may be  adjusted and any excess payment recovered.     Timeline for submission of requests for advances     8. When there is no claim for the previous academic year under the education grant or the special  education grant scheme, a staff member may request an advance prior to or within four months after  the beginning of the academic year. A staff member who becomes eligible for the education grant  after the fourth month following the beginning of the school year may request an advance until three  months before the end of the academic year. The request must be accompanied by invoices or other  official documentation from the educational institution attesting to the fees.     Submission of claims for advance    9. When there is a claim to settle the previous academic year, the request for the advance should  be presented in part IV of form P.45/EG, which should be submitted together with form P.41  (Certificate of attendance and costs and receipt for payments) in respect of the claim to settle the  previous year (part III of form P.45/EG) and documentary evidence of the anticipated charges for the  year.      10. When there is no claim for the previous academic year, only part IV of form P.45/EG needs to be  completed together with documentary evidence of the anticipated charges for the year.    Settlement of claims and recovery of advances     11. If the advance is not cleared by settlement of the relevant education grant and related benefits  claim for the previous year, it will be recovered from the staff member's salary in accordance with  section 7.2 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.1. Recovery from staff members shall take  place after the third month following the end of the academic year or upon separation from service,  whichever comes first.     12. In line with section 7.3 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.1, no advances will be  authorized for subsequent academic years until previous education grant advances granted under  the education grant scheme or under the special education grant scheme have been cleared by  settlement of the relevant claim or the recovery of the advance previously authorized has been made.     Currency of the advances     13. Advances are normally payable in United States dollars at all duty stations except Geneva. For  staff members whose duty station is Geneva, the advances will be payable in Swiss francs, as is the  practice for emoluments. In all cases, the advance will be recorded in United States dollars.    III.

Staff members should submit their claims for payment of the education grant and related benefits  on form P.45/EG at the latest within two months upon completion of the academic year, within one  month upon cessation of the child's full-time attendance or shortly before the staff member's date of  separation from service, whichever comes first.     Supporting documentation     15. Staff members must provide, along with their claim, written evidence of the child's attendance,  education costs and the specific amounts they paid. Such evidence will be submitted on form P.41,  which should be certified by the school. Staff members are required to retain a copy of form P.41 for  a period of five years from the date of submission of the claim for audit and monitoring purposes.     16. When it is not possible to submit form P.41, staff members should submit a certificate of school  attendance (form P.41/B) indicating the exact dates on which the school year began and ended  and the dates of the child's attendance, together with school bills itemizing the various charges paid  to the school, documentary proof of payment, including receipts or cancelled cheques and any  other substantiating information requested on form P.41.

Submission of incorrect information, including any revision or alteration of the certified form P.41  or the certificate of attendance may result in administrative and/or disciplinary actions.     18. Expenditures that are not paid to the educational institution and cannot therefore be certified on  form P.41 by the institution as having been paid may be claimed by attaching to form P.45/EG an  explanation of the nature of the expenditure and substantiating original documentation (for example,  receipts or cancelled cheques). If the certificate, other documentation and accompanying receipts  are not in one of the working languages of the United Nations, a translation into one of those  languages must be attached.     Admissible expenses    19. Expenses for full-time school attendance admissible are contained in section 3.1 of administrative  instruction ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.1 and amended by ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.1Amend.1.

It should be noted that receipts  or other written confirmation of cash payments are not acceptable as proof of payment.     Boarding assistance     20. A lump sum per child per academic year, is provided to eligible staff members who meet the  conditions set out in sections 2.5 to 2.8 of ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.1. Eligible staff members who meet the  conditions and wish to claim the lump sum for boarding assistance indicate so on form P.45/EG.     Attendance at an educational institution at the duty station     21. Where the educational institution is located beyond commuting distance from the area where  the staff member is serving and, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, no school in that area would  be suitable for the child, the lump sum for boarding is payable to eligible staff members provided that  all other eligibility conditions are met. The decision to exceptionally allow payment of boarding  assistance for attendance at a school beyond commuting distance from the area where the staff  member is serving and where no school in that area would be suitable for the child shall be made by  the Office of Human Resources.    IV. Scholarships, bursaries or similar grants     22. Staff members are required to disclose all scholarships, bursaries or similar grants on form P.45/EG.

Expenditures that are not paid to the educational institution and cannot therefore be certified  on form P.41 by the institution as having been paid may be claimed by attaching to form  P.45/SEG an explanation of the nature of the expenditure and substantiating original  documentation (for example, original cancelled cheques, copies of original cheques  accompanied by bank statements to verify the payments made to the tutor or to the  educational institution, money order receipts or bank transfer receipts accompanied by an  explanatory affidavit). It should be noted that written confirmation of cash payments is not  acceptable as proof of payment. If the certificate, other documentation and accompanying  receipts are not in one of the working languages of the United Nations, a translation into one of  those languages must be attached.     Admissible expenses      22. Admissible expenses are determined on the basis of the criteria contained in section 5 of  administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/2. Expenses for full-time school attendance admissible  under section 5.1 of the instruction are those that are paid directly to the school or a certified  professional providing the required special teaching and special training.     23. Where applicable, boarding expenses are admissible expenses and reimbursed, at the actual  cost upon presentation of proof of payment, within the overall maximum ceiling in accordance  with the information circular in effect for the academic year for which the claim is made.     Special benefits     24. Staff members are required to disclose on form P.45/SEG all special benefits that may be  available to them for the education and training of the child, including those provided by State  and local governments and medical insurance plans. As provided in section 6.5 of  administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/2, the amount of admissible educational expenses is  reduced by the amount of any special benefits.     Scholarships, bursaries or similar grants     25. Staff members are required to disclose all scholarships, bursaries or similar grants on form  P.45/SEG. Financial assistance in the form of a scholarship, bursary or similar grant received  directly from or through the educational institution should be certified on form P.41.     26. As provided in section 6.6 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/2, the amount of the  scholarship, bursary or similar grant is initially applied towards the non-admissible expenses  reflected on form P.41 or form P.45/SEG.     27. If the amount of the scholarship, bursary or similar grant does not exceed the non-admissible  educational expenses, the special education grant is calculated on the basis of the total  admissible expenses.     28. If the amount of the scholarship, bursary or similar grant exceeds the non-admissible expenses,  the excess amount is deducted from the admissible expenses. The special education grant is  then calculated on the basis of the remaining admissible expenses.      "

This Policy Guideline is issued to inform stakeholders of the Mission Subsistence  Allowance (MSA) rates applicable from 1 January 2024 until 31 December 2024, in  accordance with ST/AI/2021/2.     2.  It is recalled that MSA is a daily allowance payable by the United Nations to cover  long-term living costs for accommodation, meals and miscellaneous expenses incurred  within a mission by eligible non-staff personnel during their tour of duty in a field mission,  including a peacekeeping operation, special political mission or other field mission.     3.  In accordance with past practice, in case one of the MSA rates applicable in 2024  is lower than the rate applicable in 2023, the higher rate will be applied to those already  in receipt of the higher amount on 31 December 2023 as well as to future recipients who  were selected/rostered/nominated before 1 January 2024, but deployed on or after 1  January 2024.

"travel","                Policy Guidelines   Official travel: Compliance with the advance purchase policy    OHR/PG/2024/5 - 03 July 2024    General provisions    1.  These OHR Policy Guidelines provides information on the implementation of General  Assembly (GA) resolutions 75/253B and 77/263B on the advance purchase policy. These  resolutions have been incorporated into the organization's policy framework through  ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel, which came into effect on 1 July 2024.    2.  It should be noted as well that in its resolution 77/263B, the General Assembly requested  the Secretary-General to provide detailed disaggregated statistical information (by entity  and travel category) for all travel requests not compliant with the advance purchase policy  through the biennial report on standards of accommodation for air travel.  This includes  all non-compliant travel, regardless of class of travel.    3.  These guidelines do not replace the applicable Staff Regulations and Rules and relevant  administrative issuances, which prevail in case of conflict with the provisions in these  Guidelines. They will remain under continuous review and be revised as necessary.    Scope    4.  These guidelines apply to all travellers whose travel is funded by the Organization. This  includes staff and non-staff (including consultants, individual contractors, and individuals  without any contractual relationship with the Organization such as meeting participants).  However, it is important to note that these guidelines do not apply to members of  subsidiary organs, committees, councils and commissions of the United Nations, which  are administered as per ST/SGB/107/Rev.6 on travel of members of organs or subsidiary  organs.     5.  The process for exceptional approval by USG/DMSPC for travellers who are not entitled  to travel above economy to upgrade their standard of accommodation via the TTS. 3 form  remains unchanged and is outside the scope of these guidelines.  Notwithstanding, in  cases where travel above economy class has been exceptionally approved via a TTS.3  form, the travel requests should still be submitted 21 days before the start of travel.  However, in the event of late submission, the traveller is still entitled to travel in the class  as approved in the TTS.3 form.     6.  These guidelines apply to all types of travel funded by the Organization including HR travel  e.g., initial appointment, reassignment and separation.      Page | 2                    Definitions    7.  For the purpose of these guidelines:    a) Travel and Shipment Approver (TSA): the official with delegated authority to  certify travel requests for the entity (including for the head of entity) in accordance  with ST/SGB/2019/2 on Delegation of Authority in the administration of the Staff  Regulations and Rules and the Financial Regulations and Rules and as recorded in  the delegation of authority portal. A TSA is a certifying officer under Financial Rule  105.5.    b) HR Partner: The official who reviews eligibility for HR and/or entitlement travel in  accordance with the relevant HR policies.     c) Travel Processing Officer (TPO): the official approving the travel request after  TSA certification. A TPO is an approving officer under Financial Rule 105.6.    d) Travel administrator (TA): the official who may raise a travel request on behalf of  a traveller.  As such, references in these guidelines to ""travellers"" also include  ""travel administrator"".        Policy provision    8.  According to section 3.3 of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel, travel arrangements for  all travellers should be finalized 16 calendar days before the start of official travel (the  advance purchase policy). Compliance with the advance purchase policy is regulated as  follows:    ""(a) Travellers are requested to submit their travel request a minimum of 21  calendar days before the commencement of the official travel;     (b) In the case of home leave, family visit and education grant travel, failure of staff  members to submit their travel request a minimum of 21 calendar days in advance  of travel will disqualify the staff members, regardless of their level, from requesting  that the Organization purchase the tickets for such travel. The staff members will  only be eligible to receive a lump sum;     (c) In the case of other types of official travel, where the traveller is entitled to travel  above economy class under normally applicable rules, a prerequisite for  undertaking travel above economy class for all United Nations travellers, except at  the level of Assistant Secretary-General and above (and eligible family members),  is the submission of their travel request a minimum of 21 calendar days in advance  of travel, subject to the following:   Page | 3                      (i)  In situations where travel documents are delayed and the travel request  has not been submitted a minimum of 21 calendar days in advance of  travel, the head of entity has discretionary authority to approve travel above  economy class. Such approval must be recorded in Umoja for accurate  reporting to the General Assembly;     (ii)  In events such as critical incidents or natural disasters, unforeseen  circumstances, late invitations from Member States, emergencies or other  immediate or urgent operational requirements necessitating immediate  travel and therefore resulting in non-compliance with the advance  purchase policy, the head of entity has discretionary authority to approve  travel above economy class. Such approval must be recorded in Umoja for  accurate reporting to the General Assembly.""      Consequence for non-compliance with the 21 days requirements    9.  It is always recommended that travellers submit their travel requests in UMOJA as early  as possible. If a traveller becomes aware that they cannot submit the request 21 calendar  days prior to the anticipated travel date, they should discuss the situation with the TSA.  This discussion should explore whether physical travel is necessary, if travel dates can be  adjusted, and if not, what is the appropriate 'late submission reason' to be selected and  explanation to be entered in UMOJA. Taking this proactive approach may result in a faster  approval process by avoiding any time-consuming exchanges between the parties  involved, which might further delay the finalization of travel arrangements.    10.  The current policy framework allocates five calendar days from the time of the submission  of any travel request until approval by the Travel Processing Office (TPO); namely, three  days for the TSA/HR Partner and two days for the TPO.    11.  The UMOJA system will include the below categories for travellers to choose from when  explaining their delay in submitting their travel request. Cases of non-compliance will be  reported to the General Assembly as per these categories:    Category  Description of category  1. Travel document delay*  The delay was a result of the late provision of a travel  document  2. Late invitation from Member  States*  The delay was a result of a late invitation from a UN  Member State  3. Emergencies/Exigency of  service/operational  circumstances*  The delay was caused by:  *  medical/DSS approved security evacuation;   *  critical incidents or natural disasters;   *  immediate or urgent operational requirements  Page | 4                    Category  Description of category  4. Late nomination of traveller  The delay resulted from the late nomination/substitution  of the traveller  5. Delayed confirmation by  traveller  The traveller did not confirm the travel details with  sufficient time to ensure the travel request is submitted in  time on their behalf  6. Trip budget/funding issue  The delay was a result of an issue related to  budget/funding details and/or budget insufficiency  7. Late event planning  The delay was a result of the organizer's late finalization of  the event   8. Late submission by traveller  The delay was a result of late submission by the traveller,  not related to any of the other listed justifications.    * Discretionary authority under section 3.3 of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel can only be exercised if  the traveller selected category 1, 2 or 3.    Exercise of discretionary authority under the delegation of authority framework    12.  Heads of entity have authority to authorize travel using the entity's financial resources,  and such authority may be subdelegated within the entity. The above table notes that there  are three scenarios where discretionary authority can be exercised. Heads of entities must  ensure that they, or the TSA exercising certifying authority certifying travel requests on  their behalf, have determined that one of the scenarios has occurred.    13.  To aid TSAs in reflecting the entity's decision in UMOJA, we strongly recommend that  heads of entity internally determine and communicate to their respective TSAs the  circumstances under which they could apply the three scenarios. This would include the  situations that can be considered emergency/exigency of service/ operational  circumstances. The TSA will justify their decision and record the non-compliance in Umoja.  Since the exercise of discretionary authority is not considered an exception, there is no  need to report such decisions to BTAD in the exception log.    14.  Although Section 3.3 of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 allows Heads of entity to exercise  discretionary authority under the three scenarios, such authority must be exercised with  the utmost responsibility and within the boundaries of the Organization's principles,  objectives and mandate. Heads of entity should also be ready to provide any additional  justification if requested by the ACABQ or the Fifth Committee.       IMPORTANT:    Discretionary authority can only be exercised to approve travel in the class above  economy for travellers who are entitled to travel above economy class under normally  applicable rules, despite not submitting their travel request 21 days before their travel.  Page | 5                    Discretion can only be exercised if the reason for delay falls into one of these  categories:    *  Travel document delay  *  Late invitation from a UN Member State  *  Emergencies/Exigency of service/operational circumstances    Therefore, the discretionary authority cannot be exercised if the traveller selected any  other category except of the above three. No exception can be made as this is a General  Assembly resolution.          Impact    15.  When travellers who are entitled to travel above economy class under normally applicable  rules do not submit their travel request 21 days prior to their official travel, they lose their  entitlement to travel above economy class and no longer have the option to voluntarily  downgrade, unless the entity exercises their discretionary authority and approves the  travel above economy class.    16.  If travellers submit their completed and accurate travel request on time (i.e. a minimum  of 21 calendar days prior to travel but the Organization does not process their request  within the 16 days limit required by the GA resolution, travellers are not penalized, and are  still allowed to travel above economy class (e.g. business class)  including premium  economy class where available if the voluntary downgrade indicator had been selected  upon request submission. The 16-day deadline is calculated based on the TPO approval  date. Therefore, all HR Partners/TSAs/TPOs are strongly encouraged to use the 'Priority'  column in their inbox/work center to sort travel requests by priority levels: very high, high,  medium, and low. These priorities are based on how close the trip start date is and may  aid that travel requests are approved 16 days prior to the date of travel when operational  circumstances permit.    17.  If travellers who are entitled to travel above economy class under normally applicable  rules, submit their travel request prior to the 21 days limit and subsequently request an  amendment of the initial request after the 21 days limit has passed, their request may still  be considered in compliance  if the TSA is of the view that the amendment is justified in  accordance with the circumstances under which their respective entity applies  discretionary authority, and raises the same in Umoja. The TSA approving the changes  should be mindful of the potential financial implication of such last-minute amendments.  The Organization should strive to process such changes in accordance with the advance  purchase policy.     Page | 6                    18.  If a travel request submitted before the 21 days limit is returned by HR Partner/TSA/TPO  to travellers as incorrect or incomplete and travellers re-submit the request less than 21  days before their travel begins, the travellers will no longer be eligible to travel in a class  above economy class, unless the head of entity/TSA/delegate exercises their  discretionary authority in accordance with section 3.3 (c) of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on  Official travel.              Page | 7                      ANNEX I Practical Examples    1. Travel document delay*   The delay was a result of the late provision of a travel document.    All travellers must ensure that their travel documents (e.g. national passport, UNLP, visas)  are valid at all times.  Prior to undertaking travel, they must check that their documents  have at least six months validity from the intended departure date of the country to be  visited. As a general rule, staff members should aim at a validity of their travel documents  of about one year.    Each case must be reviewed by the TSA on its own merits.  TSA should take into account  the circumstances of the delays, i.e., whether it is beyond the control of the travellers, or  whether the delay could have been anticipated/prevented.      Scenario 1:  The Traveller submitted a request for renewal of his travel document in a timely manner.   While the renewal is still pending, the traveler is asked to go on an official mission in the  coming weeks. In such a scenario the traveller should submit the travel request. The  process will continue, the entity may use their discretionary authority in this case to  approve travel above economy class, if the traveler is entitled to travel above economy  class under normally applicable rules.  In the event the travel document is not obtained on  time for the scheduled departure date after the ticket is issued, the traveller must cancel  the travel immediately to minimize the loss to the organization.    Scenario 2:  In the case of onboarding new personnel, a travel request cannot be submitted 21 days  before the official travel because the entry visa for the duty station is still pending. However,  as soon as the visa is released, personnel are expected to travel to take up their assignment  as soon as possible due to operational requirements. As such, the entity may use their  discretionary authority to approve travel above economy class where the traveller is  entitled to travel above economy class under normally applicable rules.    2. Late invitation from Member States*   The delay was a result of a late invitation from a Member State.    Scenario:  Traveller could not submit travel request within the 21 days limit because invitations for a  UN member state organized meeting (e.g. related to finalization of a donor agreement)  were issued less than 21 days before the date of travel.    The entity may use their discretionary authority to approve travel above economy class  where the traveller is entitled to travel above economy class under normally applicable  Page | 8                    rules. The Member State should be referenced when recording the non-compliance in  UMOJA.    3. Emergencies/Exigency of service/operational circumstances*  The delay was caused by:  *  medical/DSS approved security evacuation;   *  critical incidents or natural disasters;   *  immediate or urgent operational requirements.    Scenario 1:  Traveller submitted the travel request less than 21 days before the start of travel as a  member of the crisis response team on an urgent trip to the country that just experienced  a severe earthquake.     Scenario 2:  Traveller submitted a travel request less than 21 days before travel to respond to a complex  emergency for which the executive head of a UN organization has requested the support  of the UN.    For both scenarios, the entity may use their discretionary authority to approve travel  above economy class where the traveller is entitled to travel above economy class under  normally applicable rules    4. Late nomination of traveller  The delay resulted from the late nomination/substitution of the traveller.    Travellers could not submit the travel request until informed of nomination to attend by  their supervisor which was less than 21 days before the travel date.    Scenario:  An office selected a staff member to accompany a senior official to a conference only two  calendar weeks prior to travel. If the invitation is not from a Member State, or there is no  emergency/exigency of service/operational circumstances requiring the traveller to attend  the conference, this is not a scenario where the entity has the discretionary authority to  allow travel above economy class because this scenario would fall outside the scope of  section 3.3 of ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel. Therefore, even if the traveller is  eligible for travel above economy class under normally applicable rules, the traveller is no  longer eligible to do so as the travel request was not submitted 21 days before the travel  date.    5. Delayed confirmation by traveller  The traveller did not confirm the travel details with sufficient time to ensure the travel  request is submitted in time on their behalf.     Page | 9                    Traveller failed to provide in the TA the necessary information to raise the travel request  21 days before the travel date.     Scenario:  Traveller provided necessary information to travel administrator less than 21 days before  the start of travel. If the invitation is not from a Member State, or there is no  emergency/exigency of service/operational circumstances requiring the traveller to travel,  this is not a scenario where entity has the discretionary authority to allow travel above  economy class because this scenario would fall outside the scope of section 3.3 of  ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1 on Official travel.  Therefore, even if the traveller is eligible for travel  above economy class under normal rule, the traveller is no longer eligible to do so as the  travel request was not submitted 21 days before the travel date. In this scenario the entity  may not exercise discretionary authority to allow travel above economy class .    6. Trip budget/funding issue  The delay was a result of an issue related to budget/funding details and/or budget  insufficiency.    Traveller could not submit travel request because of lack of budgetary funds.    Scenario:  The traveller was not able to obtain the fund code to raise the travel request 21 days before  the travel date.  If the invitation is not from a Member State, or there is no  emergency/exigency of service/operational circumstances requiring the traveller to travel,  this is not a scenario where the entity has the discretionary authority to allow travel above  economy class.  Therefore, even if the traveller is eligible for travel above economy class  under normal rules, the traveller is no longer eligible to do so as the travel request was not  submitted 21 days before the travel date. In this scenario the entity may not exercise  discretionary authority to allow travel above economy class.    7. Late event planning  The delay was a result of the organizer's late finalization of the event.    Traveller could not submit travel request within the 21 days limit because the  event/meeting details were confirmed by the organizer less than 21 days before the start  of travel.      Scenario:  Traveller was invited to present at a conference less than 21 days before the start of the  meeting.  The invitation is not from a Member State, or there is no emergency/exigency of  service/operational circumstances requiring the traveller to attend the conference, but it  was deemed important that the traveller is present. This is not a scenario where the entity  has the discretionary authority to allow travel above economy class. Therefore, even if the  traveller is eligible for travel above economy class under normal rule, the traveller is no  Page | 10                    longer eligible to do so as the travel request was not submitted 21 days before the travel  date. In this scenario the entity may not exercise discretionary authority to allow travel  above economy class.    8. Late submission by traveller  The delay was a result of late submission by the traveller, not related to any of the other  listed justifications.    Scenario 1:  Traveller could not submit the travel request within the 21 days limit due to Umoja system  unavailability.     Scenario 2:   Traveller could not submit the travel request due to illness.     As these scenarios do not involve an invitation from a Member State nor an  emergency/exigency of service/operational circumstances, the entity does not have the  discretionary authority to allow travel above economy class. Therefore, even if the traveller  is eligible for travel above economy class under normally applicable rules, the traveller is  no longer eligible to do so as the travel request was not submitted 21 days before the travel  date.

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members of a diplomatic  note received from the United States Mission to the United Nations on a change in  practice regarding the cancellation of valid United States visas in the ""G"" category  upon completion of assignment in the United States of America (see annex).  2.  The practice of the United States Mission of collecting passports of staff  members and/or dependants and household employees for visa cancellation upon  completion of assignment in the United States has been discontinued.   3.  Staff members, their dependants and household employees with ""G"" visas  valid for periods extending beyond the staff member's assignment with the United  Nations are not eligible to remain in the United States and must leave the country or  seek a change and/or adjustment of status within 30 days of their separation date.  4.  Separating staff members and/or dependants and household employees with  ""G"" visas must abide by the terms and conditions of their admission and comply  with the departure procedures. Unauthorized use of a valid United States visa issued  for an assignment with the United Nations is a violation of United States law.          * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2015/16      15-14313  2/2    Annex       Diplomatic note dated 16 July 2015 from the United States Mission  to the United Nations         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations and has the honour to refer to a change in practice regarding the  cancellation of valid United States visas in the ""G"" category upon completion of  assignment in the United States.    Previously, the United States Mission had requested that passports of staff  and/or dependants should be provided upon completion of assignment for visa  cancellation. At this time, passports containing valid United States ""G"" visas issued  to staff and their dependants, including domestic workers, should not be submitted  for visa cancellation to the Mission. Although most ""G"" visas are issued with  extended periods of validity, employees, dependants and domestic workers who  hold such visas are not eligible to remain in the United States on those visas upon  completion of their assignment with the United Nations and must depart from the  United States or seek a change and/or adjustment of status within 30 days of their  separation date.    The United States Mission recalls that separated employees, their dependants  and domestic workers are expected to abide by the terms and conditions of their  admission and to comply with the departure procedures. Unauthorized use of a valid  United States visa issued for an assignment with the United Nations is a violation of  United States law. ""G"" visas should not be used to enter the United States for  purposes unrelated to activities associated with a designated international  organization. In such cases, violators may be subject to removal.    "

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members holding a G-4  visa of a diplomatic note received from the Permanent Mission of the United States  of America to the United Nations regarding changes to the I-94 form  (arrival/departure record) and their effect on United Nations staff and their  dependents (see annex).  2.  For the purpose of streamlining the admissions process for individuals  lawfully entering the United States, the I-94 form will be automated. The  automation at ports of entry in the New York area entered into effect on 7 May 2013.  The overall purpose and contents of the I-94 form remain the same. The Host  Country Affairs Section of the Mission continues to require the hard copy of the   I-94 form of all individuals (including staff members, dependents and consultants)  for processing the renewal of G-4 visas and any other G-4 visa-related processes.  The I-94 form is available and can be printed from www.cbp.gov/I94. Applicants  need to submit the form together with their passport and other pertinent  documentation to the Travel and Transportation Section of the United Nations for  processing.  3.  Staff members are advised to familiarize themselves and are required to  comply with the details set out in the annex to the present circular. Additional  information will also be available from the Travel and Transportation Section web  page on iSeek.          * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.

The Customs and Border Protection of the United States recently announced  that the I-94 form will be automated to streamline the admissions process for  individuals lawfully visiting the United States. The overall purpose and contents of  the form, which provides international visitors with evidence that they have been  lawfully admitted to the United States, will remain unchanged. Customs and Border  Protection will start implementing the automation of the form at ports of entry in the  New York area on 7 May 2013.    The Host Country Affairs Section of the Mission will, nonetheless, continue to  require the hard copy of the I-94 form (available from www.cbp.gov/I94) from all  United Nations staff and dependents. United Nations staff should print the form  following the instructions provided on the Customs and Border Protection website  and provide it -- with their passport and other pertinent documentation -- to the  Travel and Transportation Section of the United Nations for processing. United  Nations staff who have an incorrect, lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed I-94 form  issued before automation came into effect may contact the Mission for assistance.    "

The annex to the present circular contains the list  of duty stations approved for rest and recuperation purposes effective 1 January 2020.  2.  In duty stations where the frequency of rest and recuperation has been reduced,  the new cycle takes effect immediately. In duty stations where the frequency of rest  and recuperation has been lengthened (from 4 to 6 weeks, from 6 to 8 weeks or from  8 to 12 weeks) or discontinued, staff members or eligible individuals who had already  started accruing qualifying service prior to 1 January 2020 may avail themselves of  rest and recuperation after completing the period of qualifying service previously in  effect. Upon the return of the staff member or other eligible individuals to the duty  station, the new frequency shall apply.  3.  Should security or severe hardship conditions improve or deteriorate at specific  duty stations during the course of the year, the duration of the period of qualifying  service (frequency) may be adjusted by the Office of Human Resources following  inter-agency consultations. Similarly, significant changes in a duty station  environment may result in the approval or discontinuation of rest and recuperation.  4.

Section 2     Eligibility      2.1 The eligibility requirements described in the present section apply to the  education grant and related benefits, which consist of the reimbursement of capital  assessment fees and a lump sum for boarding assistance.        Education grant and reimbursement of capital assessment fees    2.2 A staff member is eligible to receive the education grant and be reimbursed for  capital assessment fees when the staff member meets all of the following conditions:    (a)  Is an international recruit under staff rule 4.5;     (b)  Holds a fixed-term, continuing or permanent appointment;    (c)  Serves outside the recognized home country in accordance with staff  regulation 3.2 and staff rule 3.9;1  __________________    1  In accordance with section 5.5 of the administrative instruction on the visa status of non-United  States staff members serving in the United States, members of their household and their  household employees, and staff members seeking or holding permanent resident status in the  United States (ST/AI/2000/19), non-United States staff members who sign the waiver in order to  acquire permanent resident status in the United States will lose any entitlements they would  otherwise have had to international benefits under the Staff Rules by virtue of serving at a duty  station outside the country of their nationality (i.e., home leave, education grant, repatriation  grant), but only from the date on which they are granted permanent resident status as shown on  their alien registration card and not from the date on which they sign the waiver.  ST/AI/2018/1/Rev.1      18-14820  2/9      (d)  Has a child in full-time attendance at an educational institution at the  primary level or above.  2.3 Education is deemed ""primary"" for the purposes of the present instruction when  the child is 5 years of age or older at the beginning of the academic year, or when the  child reaches the age of 5 within three months of the beginning of the school year. In  exceptional circumstances, a lower minimum age of eligibility to receive the  education grant may be accepted if the child is required by law to commence formal  primary education at an earlier age.  2.4 Capital assessment fees are mandatory non-refundable fees levied by  educational institutions to fund the construction, upgrade, refurbishment and  maintenance of buildings. Such fees, which may also be known as building levies,  funds or fees, capital levies, funds or fees, first-time parent fees, incorporation fees  or development fees, may be levied: (a) as a one-time payment for a first-time  enrolling child; (b) every year; or (c) as needed.

The commuting  distance at duty stations should be established by the local administrative or human  resources offices by taking into account the local conditions at the duty station.  2.7 Notwithstanding the provision of section 2.5 (b) above, and in order to avoid  disrupting the continuity of the education of a child who is boarding to attend school  at the primary or secondary level, a staff member is eligible for boarding assistance  if one of the following conditions is met:     (a)  The staff member is serving in a category H duty station 2   and was in  receipt of boarding assistance for the academic year in progress on 1 January 2017  and the child remains at the same school beyond that date;     (b)  The staff member is assigned, reassigned or transferred from a duty station  with a hardship classification of A to E to a headquarters duty station during the school  __________________    2  All duty stations are placed by the International Civil Service Commission into one of six  categories: H and A to E.

The purpose of the present circular is to provide additional guidance on the  United States eligibility requirements for derivative G visa status for relatives of a  staff member other than a spouse, unmarried dependent children under the age of 21  and children for whom a staff member receives an education grant.   2.  Paragraph 5 of information circular ST/IC/2001/27 on visa status in the United  States of America describes the conditions under which relatives of a staff member  other than a spouse, unmarried dependent children under the age of 21 and children  for whom a staff member receives an education grant may be eligible for a G-4 visa  when they demonstrate close ties and a continued dependency on the staff member.  The Secretary-General received a diplomatic note from the United States Mission to  the United Nations dated 26 April 2013 that provides further guidance on the United  States eligibility requirements for derivative G visa status for secondary dependants  of United Nations staff (see annex).  3.  Secondary dependants of staff members renewing their G-4 visa will need to  demonstrate that they meet the United States eligibility requirements as described in  the diplomatic note. Applications for a G-4 visa for secondary dependants of staff  members are submitted to the United Nations Visa Committee, and subsequently to  the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management for approval,  prior to submission to the United States authorities. If the applicant is found  ineligible under the applicable regulations, he or she may seek a change of status to  a B-2 visa or apply for a B-2 visa outside the United States.  4.  Staff members are advised to familiarize themselves and comply with the  details set out in the annex to the present circular.        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2013/15      13-33134  2    Annex       Diplomatic note dated 26 April 2013 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations addressed to the Secretariat        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to provide further guidance on  United States eligibility requirements for derivative G status for secondary  dependants of United Nations staff.    The United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the United States  Department of State regulations determine the eligibility of dependants of G visa  holders to obtain derivative G visa status. There are two categories of dependants  who qualify for derivative G status as members of the principal alien's immediate  family.    The first category is restricted to the spouse and unmarried children  (regardless of age) of a principal alien, provided they are ""not members of some  other household"" and ""will reside regularly in the household of the principal alien"".  The second category comprises other close relatives or dependants of the principal  alien or spouse, including parents, who ""will reside regularly in the household of the  principal alien"", are ""not a member of some other household"", and are ""recognized  as an immediate family member of the principal alien by the sending Government or  international organization, as demonstrated by eligibility for rights and benefits,  such as the issuance of a diplomatic or official passport or other similar  documentation, or travel or other allowances"", which would be granted to the  spouse and children of the principal alien (22 CFR 41.21 (a)(3)(i)-(v)).    Secondary dependants renewing their G-4 visas need to demonstrate their  eligibility in accordance with the provisions listed above, as required by 22 CFR 41.21  (a)(3)(i)-(v). If the applicant is found ineligible under 22 CFR 41.21 (a)(3)(i)-(v), the  applicant may seek a change of status to a B-2 visa or apply for the B-2 visa outside the  United States.    Some of the ways in which an applicant for secondary dependant status might  demonstrate recognition through ""other allowances"" are listed below:    (a)  Enrolment as a dependant in medical benefits plans that is sponsored by  the embassy/organization;    (b)  Documentation that substantiates that the staff member's monthly  insurance premium includes deductions for the dependent parent;    (c)  Income of the principal alien reflects an allowance for a dependent  parent;    (d)  Travel benefits provided by the sponsoring embassy/organization are  used exclusively for travel of the dependent parent;    (e)  Memberships and associations that are available only to employees and  their family members.

The Secretary-General has received from the Permanent Mission of the United  States of America to the United Nations a note verbale dated 23 October 2009,  replacing its note verbale of 1 November 2004, in which it informs the Secretariat of  the requirements concerning the employment of personal workers, attendants and  other domestic workers employed by United Nations officials who are in the United  States in non-immigrant G-5 visa status.   2.  The text of the note verbale is set out in the annex to the present circular.   3.  The present circular supersedes information circular ST/IC/2005/37 of 26 July  2005.        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2009/42      09-62744  2    Annex       Note verbale dated 23 October 2009 from the   Permanent Mission of the United States of America to the  United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to refer to the standards  applicable to the employment of personal workers, attendants, and any other  domestic workers employed by United Nations officials who are in the United States  in non-immigrant G-5 visa status. The United States Mission wishes to emphasize  the importance to the United States Government of providing fair treatment to  domestic workers who come to the United States to work for members of the  diplomatic community and to request that the United Nations Secretary-General take  any and all measures necessary to ensure that the officials of the Organization  employing such workers respect the laws relating to the treatment to be accorded  domestic workers. This note supersedes previous notes on this subject.         New domestic worker visa eligibility requirements      The United States Mission wishes to inform the United Nations Secretariat of  two new requirements it is implementing in connection with the employment of  domestic workers by United Nations officials that pertain to the visa eligibility of  prospective domestic workers. The United States Mission currently requires that it  be notified at the time of the arrival in and departure from the United States of all  domestic workers.     Effective November 15, 2009, the United States Mission will also require that  it be provided with notification of any prospective domestic worker before the  worker applies for a visa. This ""pre-notification"" requires that the Visa Committee  of the United Nations Office of Human Resources Management submit a completed  ""Pre-Notification of a Domestic Worker"" form (""Pre-Notification Form"") addressed  to UNDomesticWorkers@state.gov. The Pre-Notification Form, a sample of which  is attached for reference, may also be found on the Host Country Affairs section of  the United States Mission's website at www.usun.state.gov/about/host_aff/  index.htm. The United States Mission must receive this notification prior to a  domestic worker's submission of an application for a G-5 visa, as such visas will  not be issued unless the Pre-Notification Form has been submitted. It should be  noted that this pre-notification process does not, however, guarantee the issuance of  a G-5 visa or change other non-immigrant visa eligibility requirements relating to  such visas. Finally, the United States Mission wishes to advise that it accepts the  submission of Pre-Notification Forms with the understanding that any such  proposed employment by a United Nations official of a domestic worker has been  reviewed and authorized by the Assistant Secretary General for Human Resources  Management. It is also the understanding of the United States Mission that each  review and authorization will have taken into consideration the financial support  requirements described in the following paragraph.    In addition to requiring a Pre-Notification Form before a G-5 visa can be  issued, the Department of State has determined that such visas will not be issued  unless the United States consular officer responsible for reviewing the visa  application reasonably concludes that the United Nations official will be able to    ST/IC/2009/42   3  09-62744    provide the required wages and working conditions, which are addressed below. To  implement this policy, consular officers will now presume that any prospective  employer of a domestic worker who does not carry the diplomatic rank of Minister  or above, or in the case of the United Nations officials at the level of D-1 or above,  will not be able to provide the legally required wages and working conditions. To  overcome this presumption, a prospective employer without that rank would have to  demonstrate to the consular officer reviewing the G-5 visa application that he or she  has the financial ability to pay the salary of the domestic worker as specified in the  contract, as well as related travel expenses. The consular officer will also take into  consideration the number of domestic workers that a particular United Nations  official may reasonably have the ability to employ. If a United Nations official seeks  to replace a domestic worker or add to his/her existing domestic staff, the G-5 visa  may be denied if the United States Mission or the Department of State has credible  evidence that the official failed to fulfil his or her obligations to a former or current  domestic worker, such as to abide by the contract terms generally, and specifically,  to pay a fair wage.         Terms of employment of domestic workers by United Nations staff members      The United Nations Secretariat is reminded of the requirements placed on  United Nations officials who employ domestic workers that they are required to  have a written employment contract. The employment contract is necessary and  required to assist both the employer and the domestic worker in establishing a good  faith employment relationship in which each of the parties is expected to carry out  the terms of the contract. The contract must be in English and, if the domestic  worker does not understand English, in a language understood by the domestic  worker. Two copies of the contract should be signed by both parties with one for the  employer and one for the domestic worker. In addition, when a prospective domestic  worker applies for a visa, the worker must provide a copy of the signed employment  contract to the consular official.     The United States Mission is modifying the requirements to the terms of  employment of domestic workers by members of the United Nations community,  which must be included in employment contracts. Most notably, in the past, the  United States Mission has required United Nations officials to retain records of the  number of hours worked and of the payments made in connection with that work. As  of November 15, 2009, the United States Mission will require that the payment of  domestic workers be made by check or electronic funds transfer to a bank account in  the domestic worker's name only. Payments in cash are no longer permissible. The  United Nations Secretary-General is encouraged to implement internal policies to  ensure that this obligation is adhered to such that, in the event of a dispute, the  United Nations will have ready access to payment records.    An employment contract with a domestic worker should include the following:    * Description of duties. The contract must describe the work to be performed,  e.g., housekeeping, gardening, child care, and must also include a statement  that the domestic worker shall work only for the employer who signed the  contract.     * Hours of work. The contract must state the normal working hours and number  of hours per week. It is generally expected that a minimum of 35-40 hours per  week of paid employment will be provided. It should also state that the  ST/IC/2009/42      09-62744  4    domestic worker will be provided a minimum of at least one full day off each  week. The contract should also indicate whether the domestic worker will be  provided paid holidays, sick days and vacation days.     * Minimum wage. The contract must state the hourly wage to be paid the  domestic worker. The rate must be the greater of the minimum wage under  federal and state law or the prevailing wage for all working hours, as  determined by the Department of State. The contract should state that wages  will be paid to the domestic worker either on a weekly or biweekly basis and  state what deductions are to be taken from the wages. If any deduction is taken  for meals or lodging, it must be no more than is reasonable.     * Overtime work. The contract must state that any hours worked in excess of  the normal number of hours worked per week are considered overtime hours. It  should also state that such work must be paid in accordance with the  requirements of Local law.    * Transportation to and from the United States. The contract must state that  the domestic worker will be provided with transportation to and from the  United States.    * Tax payments. The employer shall ensure that all of his/her domestic workers  having G-5 visa status have sufficient information regarding wages and other  payments or withholdings made to any tax or other government authorities in  order to enable such domestic workers to properly prepare and file any  required tax or other forms required to be filed by such authorities. The  employer shall ensure that any forms required to be filed by the employer to  any such tax or other governmental authorities on behalf of such domestic  workers have been timely and appropriately prepared and filed. Unless such  domestic workers having G-5 visa status are from a country with which the  United States of America has a totalization/social security agreement providing  that such workers are not required to participate in the United States Social  Security program, or unless the United Nations official is otherwise exempt,  the employer shall pay the employer's portion of Social Security taxes and  Medicare and any other required federal, state, or local taxes or contributions,  including  federal  and  state  unemployment  insurance  and  workers  compensation insurance on all wages actually paid, which shall not be less  than the applicable minimum or prevailing wage. Unless otherwise paid by the  employer, the domestic worker shall pay the employee's portion of Social  Security and all federal, state and local taxes in connection with his/her  income.    * Other required terms of employment. The contract must state that the  employer agrees to abide by all federal, state and local laws in the United  States. The contract must also include a statement that the domestic worker's  passport and visa will be in the sole possession of the domestic worker. In  addition, the contract must state that a copy of the contract and other personal  property of the domestic worker will not be withheld by the diplomatic or  consular employer for any reason.     * Other terms of employment. The contract should include a statement that the  domestic worker's presence in the employer's residence will not be required  except during working hours. The contract may include other agreed-upon    ST/IC/2009/42   5  09-62744    terms of employment, if any, provided they are fully consistent with all United  States federal, state and local laws. Any modification to the contract must be in  writing.     To avoid possible misunderstanding, all United Nations officials employing  domestic workers should maintain for the duration of actual employment plus three  years, a copy of the contract and proof of wage payments, e.g., cancelled checks or  electronic fund transfers (signed receipts for cash payments are not permissible); a  record of daily and weekly hours worked, including any overtime; and a record of  any deductions made.        Treatment of domestic workers: the role of the United Nations      The United States Mission looks to the Secretary-General to be responsible for  the conduct of the officials of the Organization and for ensuring that their treatment  of domestic workers in their employ evidences respect for all applicable United  States laws. In this regard, it is recommended that the appropriate United Nations  office maintain copies of the signed domestic worker contracts and be able to review  such contracts, as well as records of payments made to each domestic worker, in the  event that the United States Mission seeks assistance if faced with credible  allegations of a United Nations official's mistreatment of a domestic worker. The  United States Mission and/or the Department of State refer credible allegations of  abuse of domestic workers by United Nations officials which may constitute  criminal conduct to the United States Department of Justice. In that context, the  United States Mission and the Department of State may take other appropriate  action, including, based on the determination by an appropriate prosecuting  authority that prosecution is warranted, a request for a waiver of any applicable  immunity. United Nations officials are not only expected to pay the minimum or  prevailing wage and abide by other contract terms, but they should also be aware  that in the United States, withholding a person's passport may be evidence of the  crime of trafficking in persons if it is done with the intent of keeping that person in  a state of forced labour or service.     The recently passed William Wilberforce Trafficking Victim's Protection  Reauthorization Act requires the Secretary of State to ""suspend for such period as  the Secretary determines necessary, the issuance of A-3 visas or G-5 visas to  applicants seeking to work for officials of a diplomatic mission or international  organization, if the Secretary determines that there is credible evidence that one or  more employees of such mission or international organization have abused or  exploited one or more non-immigrants holding an A-3 or G-5 visa, and that the  diplomatic mission or international organization tolerated such actions"".        Documentation requirements upon arrival and departure       The United Nations Secretariat is reminded that, if a domestic worker is issued  a visa and admitted to the United States, the United Nations is required to submit  the following documents to the United States Mission upon the worker's entry into  the United States: the original passport, containing the most recent original I-94  ""Departure Record"", and a copy of the signed contract between the employer and  the domestic worker in English. This official registration must be accomplished  within 90 days of the date of the original pre-notification request.  ST/IC/2009/42      09-62744  6      The United States Mission wishes to remind the United Nations Secretariat  that it is the responsibility of employers of personal domestic workers to retransfer  abroad all workers upon the workers' leaving their employ or upon the transfer of  the employer. This responsibility remains applicable notwithstanding the  circumstances surrounding the termination of the employment. The United States  Mission, however, will not object to the domestic worker's changing employers  provided that the new employer is in a legal status to offer such employment, offers  fair and reasonable employment conditions, and will assume the responsibility to  retransfer the domestic worker abroad at the conclusion of the employment. The  United States Mission also wishes to remind the Secretariat that all domestic  employees must be notified to the United States Mission upon their arrival in the  United States, and upon their departure or transfer to a new employer.    The United States Government places a strong emphasis on its commitment to  combat abuse and trafficking in persons in all forms and underscores that it takes  seriously any allegations of mistreatment of domestic workers by their diplomatic  employer.    The United States Mission to the United Nations avails itself of this  opportunity to renew to the United Nations Secretariat the assurances of its highest  consideration.

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members who hold a G-4  visa and employ a household employee to whom a G-5 visa has been granted of a  diplomatic note received from the Permanent Mission of the United States of  America to the United Nations (see annex). The note concerns changes to the terms  of employment of the household employees and to the visa eligibility requirements.   2.  The terms of employment of domestic workers by United Nations staff  members have been amended in order to reflect the following changes:    (a)  Deductions from wages will no longer be allowed for food for G-5  domestic workers;    (b)  The domestic workers' bank accounts must be in the United States so that  the domestic workers may readily access and utilize their wages.   3.  With regard to the visa eligibility requirements for domestic workers, the  United States Department of State requests that the Visa Committee of the Office of  Human Resources Management review all requests for pre-notification of domestic  workers. Such review shall ensure that, in addition to meeting other criteria, the  requests reflect a bona fide employee-employer relationship. Applications for visas  for the employment of close family members will undergo an extensive review by  United States consular officers abroad to ensure that they reflect a true employer- employee relationship.  4.  In addition, all G-5 visa requests will be reviewed in order to ensure that the  employing officer has the means to afford to pay prevailing or minimum wages in  the United States, whichever are higher. Particular attention shall be given to  requests for multiple G-5 employees to be employed in a singular diplomatic or  non-diplomatic household.  5.  The provisions of the present circular shall enter into effect on 15 February  2012. As at that date, all contract or payment practices between domestic workers  and their employers must be amended accordingly.        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice and complements ST/IC/2009/42 and  ST/IC/2011/28.  ST/IC/2012/7      12-23906  2    Annex       Diplomatic note dated 20 January 2012 from the Permanent  Mission of the United States of America to the United Nations  addressed to the Secretary-General        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to refer to its diplomatic circulars  HC-125-(S)-09 dated 23 October 2009 and HC-129-(S)-11 dated 28 September 2011  (available from http://usun.state.gov/about/host_aff/129277.htm), which set forth  extensive requirements with regard to the employment of foreign domestic workers.    The above-referenced notes emphasized the importance that the United States  Government places on providing fair treatment to foreign domestic workers brought  into the United States to work for diplomatic and non-diplomatic personnel, and  required that the Secretariat take any and all measures necessary to ensure that  officials of the Organization employing such workers respect the laws relating to the  treatment to be accorded such workers. The Department of State wishes to remind  the United Nations Secretariat that the Department ultimately looks to the  Secretariat to ensure that the conduct of the officials of the Organization comports  with Department requirements and is in compliance with the relevant United States  laws.    The Department of State's efforts to combat trafficking in persons are guided  by the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of  2008, which includes the requirement that the Secretary of State suspend the  issuance of G-5 visas for a diplomatic mission or an international organization if she  finds credible evidence that a domestic worker was abused and the diplomatic  mission or international organization tolerated the abuse.        Terms of employment of domestic workers by international   organization members      The Department has determined that in addition to not allowing for deductions  from wages for lodging (as required by diplomatic circular note HC-129-(S)-11),  deductions from wages will no longer be allowed for food for G-5 domestic  workers.    Further, as the United Nations Secretariat is aware, as of October 2009, the  Department of State has required that all wages for G-5 domestic workers be paid by  check or electronic funds transfer into bank accounts. The Department wishes to  clarify that these bank accounts must be in the United States in order that domestic  workers may readily access and utilize their wages. Consistent with the banking  requirements set forth in the October 2009 note, this requirement takes effect   90 days after the commencement of employment of a specific domestic worker; cash  payment of wages is not permitted, and bank accounts must be in the domestic  worker's name only.        Domestic worker visa eligibility requirements      The Department also wishes to take this opportunity to request that the Visa  Committee of the Office of Human Resources Management review all requests for  pre-notification of domestic workers to ensure that, in addition to meeting other    ST/IC/2012/7   3  12-23906    criteria, the requests reflect a bona fide employee-employer relationship.  Specifically, the Department is concerned about the recent cases involving officials  employing persons who were or appeared to be family members. Applications for  visas for the employment of close family members will undergo an extensive review  by United States consular officers abroad to ensure that they reflect a true employer- employee relationship. The Department wishes to note that G-5 visa requests will be  reviewed with regard to ensuring that the employing officer has the means to afford  to pay prevailing or minimum wages in the United States, whichever are higher,  particularly with regard to requests for multiple G-5 employees to be employed in a  singular diplomatic or non-diplomatic household. (The circular note HC-129-(S)-11  sets forth current wage rates.)    The provisions of this note will go into effect on 15 February 2012, and as of  that date all employment contracts with G-5 workers should be amended to be in  accordance with the provisions of this note and the notes of October 2009 and  September 2011.    The United States Mission to the United Nations avails itself of this  opportunity to renew to the United Nations Secretariat the assurances of its highest  consideration.    "

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members who hold a   G-4 visa and employ or seek to employ a household employee to whom a G-5 visa  has been granted or has been requested of a diplomatic note received from the  United States Mission to the United Nations (see annex). The note concerns a  reminder of the requirements relating to the hiring of domestic workers and the  importance of all staff members abiding by them.   2.  The United States Mission also reminds staff members and the United Nations  Secretariat to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of domestic workers. Staff  must take into consideration the information and recommendations contained in the  diplomatic note and the present circular, including but not limited to the following:    (a)  A provision in the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 requires the Secretary of State to suspend, when  necessary, the issuance of G-5 visas to applicants seeking to work for officials of an  international organization if there is credible evidence of abuse and exploitation of  the G-5 visa holder and if the concerned organization is found to have tolerated such  acts;     (b)  If a prosecuting authority in the United States advises the Department of  State and/or the United States Mission that, but for a staff member's immunity, it  would prosecute the staff member for a serious crime relating to the abuse or  exploitation of a domestic worker, the Department's policy is to request a waiver of  any applicable immunity and, in the absence of a waiver, to require the departure of  the staff member of the United Nations and his or her dependants;    (c)  The United Nations Secretariat is encouraged to implement internal  policies to ensure adherence by staff members to the requirements regarding method  of payment and retention of contracts and payment records. In that context, staff  members are expected to retain all employment and payment records pertaining to        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice and complements ST/IC/2009/42,  ST/IC/2012/7 and ST/IC/2013/30.  ST/IC/2014/19      14-58232  2/8    their domestic employees under a G-5 visa and to make such documentation  available upon request;    (d)  Staff members are expected to pay any damages awarded by a court with  jurisdiction over a case brought against them by their former domestic workers.  After staff members are terminated, they are not immune from jurisdiction for  matters relating to their employment of domestic workers because the acts  comprising the employment of a domestic worker are not acts performed as a staff  member and, thus, are not within the scope of residual immunity under article 39 (2)  of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  3.  The note provides details of domestic worker visa eligibility requirements,  which include pre-notification, ability to pay, and contract requirements, as well as  other required and recommended terms of employment. It also provides the  procedure for registering a domestic worker upon arrival in the United States,  making wage payments, updating written contracts and providing notification of  termination.    ST/IC/2014/19    3/8  14-58232    Annex        Diplomatic note dated 3 July 2014 from the United States Mission  to the United Nations addressed to the Secretariat         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to refer to its diplomatic notes  HC-125-S-09 dated 23 October 2009, HC-18-S-12 dated 20 January 2012 and  HC-99-S-13 dated 27 September 2013, which set forth the requirements regarding  the employment of foreign domestic workers. The United States Mission wishes to  remind the United Nations Secretariat of these requirements and to request that all  staff members of the United Nations again be apprised of the Department of State's  requirements relating to the hiring of domestic workers and the importance of all the  staff members of the United Nations abiding by them.    The United States Mission would also like to take this opportunity to remind  the United Nations Secretariat that a provision of the William Wilberforce  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 requires the Secretary of  State to ""suspend, for such period as the Secretary determines necessary, the  issuance of A-3 visas or G-5 visas to applicants seeking to work for officials of a  diplomatic mission or an international organization, if the Secretary determines that  there is credible evidence that one or more employees of such mission or  international organization have abused or exploited one or more non-immigrants  holding an A-3 visa or a G-5 visa, and that the diplomatic mission or international  organization tolerated such actions"". A review by the Secretary of evidence of abuse  or exploitation and the United Nations Organization's toleration of such abuse or  exploitation would take many factors into account, potentially including United  Nations Secretariat policies and record-keeping regarding the employment of  domestic workers. The staff members of the United Nations should be advised that,  in the United States, withholding a person's passport may be evidence of the crime  of trafficking in persons or constitute a separate crime of unlawful conduct with  respect to immigration documents. Under United States law, trafficking in persons  includes the crime of subjecting someone to forced labour through restraint, force,  threats of force or legal coercion (such as a threat to send a person to jail or to be  deported), in order to obtain that person's labour.    In addition, the United States Mission wishes to remind the United Nations  Secretariat of its policy regarding serious crimes. If a prosecuting authority in the  United States advises the Department of State and/or the United States Mission that,  but for a staff member's immunity, it would prosecute the staff member of the  United Nations for a serious crime relating to the abuse or exploitation of a  domestic worker, Department policy is to request a waiver of any applicable  immunity and, in the absence of a waiver, to require the departure of the staff  member of the United Nations and his or her dependants.    Since 2009, the Department has informed the United Nations Secretariat of its  efforts to develop a framework to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of  domestic workers and provided the United Nations Secretariat with information and  guidance relating to the employment of such workers. The Department has also  advised the United Nations Secretariat to take any and all measures necessary to  ensure that staff members of the United Nations employing domestic workers  respect the laws that relate to the treatment of these workers. It is essential that all  ST/IC/2014/19      14-58232  4/8    those who employ domestic workers comply with their contractual obligations and  otherwise treat their workers in a fair and equitable manner. The United States  Mission has made clear that it looks to the United Nations Secretariat to be  responsible for the conduct of staff members of the United Nations and to ensure  that staff members employing domestic workers respect all relevant requirements.  Accordingly, the United Nations Secretariat is encouraged to implement internal  policies to ensure adherence by staff members of the United Nations to the  requirements outlined below regarding method of payment and retention of  contracts and payment records. The United States Mission also recommends that the  United Nations Secretariat maintain copies of signed contracts between its staff  members and their domestic workers, and that the United Nations Secretariat be able  to review such contracts as well as records of payments made, and hours worked, in  the event that the Department receives serious allegations of a staff member's  mistreatment of a domestic worker and seeks United Nations Secretariat assistance  in gathering payment information.    The failure of the United Nations Secretariat to provide payment records to the  Department and/or the United States Mission, if requested in the event of abuse  allegations, would be brought to the Secretary's attention in any review he might  undertake, pursuant to the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008, regarding suspension of domestic worker visas for a  particular staff member of the United Nations. Further, the failure to provide  requested records regarding a staff member's employment of a domestic worker  could result in a denial of a request by the staff member to replace a former  domestic worker or to increase his or her existing domestic staff.    Consistent with the general expectation that staff members of the United  Nations pay their just debts, staff members are expected to pay any judgement  awarding damages by a court with jurisdiction over a case brought against them by  their former domestic workers. In 2010, a United States appellate court determined  that former staff members of the United Nations who enjoy immunity while  accredited are not immune from jurisdiction for matters relating to their  employment of domestic workers after the staff members are terminated, because  the acts comprising the employment of a domestic worker are not acts performed as  a staff member of the United Nations and, thus, are not within the scope of residual  immunity under article 39 (2) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.        Domestic worker visa eligibility requirements         Pre-notification       In the United States Mission's diplomatic note HC-125-S-09 dated 23 October  2009, the United Nations Secretariat was informed of the requirement that any  prospective domestic worker must be notified to the Department before the worker  applies for a visa. This ""pre-notification"" requires the United Nations Secretariat to  submit a ""pre-notification of a domestic worker"" form (""pre-notification form"")  addressed to UNDomesticWorkers@state.gov. The pre-notification form can be  found on the United States Mission's website under the host country accreditation  and registration section at www.usun.state.gov/about/host_aff/c32163.htm. The  United States Mission must receive this notification prior to the issuance of a   G-5 visa. The United Nations Secretariat should note that this pre-notification  process does not guarantee the issuance of a G-5 visa, nor does it change other    ST/IC/2014/19    5/8  14-58232    non-immigrant visa eligibility requirements relating to such visas. The United States  Mission wishes to advise that it accepts pre-notification forms with the  understanding that the United Nations Secretariat has reviewed and authorized any  such proposed employment by a staff member of the United Nations of a domestic  worker.        Ability to pay       In addition, the United States Mission requires that G-5 visas not be issued  unless the United States consular officer responsible for reviewing the visa  application reasonably concludes that the staff member of the United Nations will  be able to provide the required wages and working conditions (addressed below).  Consular officers will presume that a prospective domestic worker will not be  provided the legally required wages and working conditions if the staff member of  the United Nations does not carry the diplomatic rank of Assistant Secretary- General or above. To overcome this presumption, a prospective employer not having  the rank of Assistant Secretary-General or above must demonstrate to the consular  officer that he or she has the financial ability to pay the salary and related travel  expenses of the domestic worker as specified in the contract. Consideration is also  given to the number of domestic workers a staff member of the United Nations may  reasonably be able to pay.    Consular officers will also presume that a prospective domestic worker is not  eligible for a G-5 visa if the staff member of the United Nations has had previous  instances of non-compliance with the contract of G-5 employees, or has had a  pattern of employee disappearance, or if the Department and/or the United States  Mission has received reliable allegations of mistreatment or abuse by that employer.  To overcome this presumption, the staff member must demonstrate to the consular  officer that such an outcome is not likely to reoccur.        Contract       The United States Mission's diplomatic notes HC-125-S-09 dated 23 October  2009 and HC-18-S-12 dated 20 January 2012 further specified the terms of  employment that must be included in a written employment contract between a staff  member of the United Nations and his or her domestic worker. The contract must be  in English; if the domestic worker does not understand English, the contract must  also be in a language understood by the domestic worker. Two copies of the contract  must be signed by both parties, and a copy of the signed contract in English must be  provided to the consular officer when a domestic worker applies for a visa. If the  domestic worker does not understand English, a copy of the contract in English and  in a language understood by the domestic worker must be provided to the consular  officer.    All contracts must include the following provisions:    * Description of duties. The contract must describe the work to be performed  (e.g. housekeeping (light or heavy), cooking, gardening, child care (how many  children)) and must also include a statement that the domestic worker shall  work only for the employer who signed the contract and will not accept any  other employment while working for the employer.  ST/IC/2014/19      14-58232  6/8      * Hours of work. The contract must state the time of the normal working hours  and the number of hours per week. It is generally expected that domestic  workers will be required to work 35 to 40 hours per week. It must also state  that the domestic worker will be provided a minimum of one full day off each  week. The contract must indicate the number of paid national holidays, sick  days and vacation days the domestic worker will be provided.    * Wage rate. The contract must state the hourly wage to be paid to the domestic  worker. The rate must be the greater of the minimum wage under United States  federal and state law or the prevailing wage for all working hours. Domestic  workers in the New York City metro area must currently be paid a minimum of  $10.32 per hour and overtime for all hours worked above 40 hours per week  unless the domestic worker lives in the employer's residence. In such cases,  the domestic worker must be paid an overtime wage for all hours worked  above 44 hours per week. The contract must state that wages will be paid to  the domestic worker either weekly or biweekly. No deductions may be taken  from wages for lodging, medical care, medical insurance, travel or food.  Changes to the prevailing wage will be notified to the United Nations  Secretariat in the form of a diplomatic note. Upon receipt, all contracts must  be amended to reflect the new prevailing wage rate.    * Overtime work. The contract must state that any hours worked in excess of  the normal number of hours worked per week (35-40 hours, except as noted  above) are considered overtime hours, and that hours in which the employee is  ""on call"" count as work hours. It must also state that such overtime work must  be paid as required by United States local laws.    * Method of payment. The contract must state that after the first 90 days of  employment, all wage payments must be made by cheque or by electronic fund  transfer to a bank account in the domestic worker's name only. Neither staff  members of the United Nations nor their family members should have access  to domestic worker bank accounts.    * Transportation to and from the United States. The contract must state that  the employer will pay for all travel costs related to the employment of the  domestic worker, which include transportation to the United States to begin  employment, transportation from the United States when employment has  concluded, and travel expenses related to any trips where the domestic worker  has been asked to accompany the employer's family.    * Tax payments. The employer shall ensure that all of his/her domestic workers  having G-5 visa status have sufficient information regarding wages and other  payments or withholdings made to any tax or other government authorities in  order to enable such domestic workers to properly prepare and file any  required tax or other forms required to be filed by such authorities. The  employer shall ensure that any forms required to be filed by the employer to  any such tax or other governmental authorities on behalf of such domestic  workers have been prepared and filed appropriately and in a timely manner.  Unless such domestic workers having G-5 visa status are from a country with  which the United States of America has a totalization/social security  agreement providing that such workers are not required to participate in the  United States social security programme or unless the staff member of the  United Nations is otherwise exempt, the employer shall pay the employer's    ST/IC/2014/19    7/8  14-58232    portion of social security taxes and Medicare and any other required federal,  state or local taxes or contributions, including federal and state unemployment  insurance and workers compensation insurance on all wages actually paid,  which shall not be less than the applicable minimum or prevailing wage.  Unless otherwise paid by the employer, the domestic worker shall pay the  employee's portion of social security and all federal, state and local taxes in  connection with his/her income.    * Other required terms of employment. The contract must state that the  employer agrees to abide by appropriate federal, state and local laws in the  United States. The contract must also include a statement that the domestic  worker's passport, visa and any I-94 card will be in the sole possession of the  domestic worker and that a copy of the employment contract and other  personal property of the domestic worker will not be withheld by the employer  for any reason. Such personal property may include, but is not limited to, bank  cards or statements, computers and cell phones. The contract should also  include a statement that the domestic worker's presence in the employer's  residence will not be mandated except during working hours. Any modification  to the contract must be in writing.    * Other recommended terms of employment. The contract may also include  additional terms of employment agreed upon, if any, provided they are fully  consistent with all applicable United States federal, state and local laws.        Domestic worker arrival in the United States       Once a domestic worker has arrived in the United States and begun his or her  employment, the staff member of the United Nations must register the domestic  worker by submitting a clarification of status of household employee and arrival  notice (form P.312A) to the Visa Committee and the Travel and Transportation  Section of the United Nations Secretariat within five days of entry into the United  States. A signed copy of the employment contract in English must be submitted to  the Visa Committee.        Domestic worker wage payments       In compliance with the contractual terms above, the staff members of the  United Nations employing domestic workers are required to make wage payments to  domestic workers by cheque or electronic fund transfer to the domestic worker's  bank account within 90 days of commencement of employment (cash payments with  a receipt are permissible only within the first 90 days of employment).    Staff members of the United Nations are also required to retain records of  employment and proof of wage payments made and to include a copy of the signed  contract, weekly records of the number of hours worked, and proof of the payments  made in connection to that work (e.g. cancelled cheque or electronic fund transfers,  or signed receipts of cash payments during the first 90 days of employment). To  avoid possible misunderstanding, all employers must maintain these records for the  duration of the domestic worker's employment plus three years after.    ST/IC/2014/19      14-58232  8/8        Updating written contracts       Staff members of the United Nations employing domestic workers are required  to update contracts, in writing, to reflect any changes to previously agreed  information between the employee and employer to ensure that the contract is fully  consistent with United States government requirements and all current United States  federal, state and local laws.        Notification of termination       Staff members of the United Nations must notify the Visa Committee when a  domestic worker has ended his or her term of employment and whether he or she  has departed the United States. Submission of notifications of termination of  domestic workers who have left the employment of staff members of the United  Nations will relieve employers of their responsibility for such workers.

All domestic workers employed by staff members accredited to the United  Nations Secretariat for 90 days or more must apply for a valid G-5 visa once the  United States Mission accepts the pre-notification request. Domestic workers who  have an employee relationship that predates the accreditation of their employer at  the United Nations Secretariat must also seek a G-5 visa.     The United States Mission wishes to remind the United Nations Secretariat  that G-5 visa holders must maintain lawful status in the United States, as determined  by the date on their United States Customs and Border Protection Form I-94 arrival/  departure record. Please contact the United States Mission to the United Nations,  Office of Host Country Affairs (usunvisas@state.gov), with any questions on  remaining in appropriate status and on visa renewal options overseas.

The purpose of this circular is to inform staff members of the United Nations  holding a G-4 visa who employ a household employee to whom a G-5 visa has been  granted of four diplomatic notes received from the United States Mission to the United  Nations (see annexes). The diplomatic notes contain a reminder of the policies  regarding employment of domestic workers, including new requirements, the  upcoming commencement of the In-Person Registration Program for domestic workers  employed by United Nations staff members and updated minimum wages for domestic  workers on a G-5 visa in the States of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.        Compliance with requirements of the Domestic Worker Program     2.  The diplomatic notes in annexes I and II remind the United Nations Secretariat of  the legal requirements and Department of State policies on the employment of domestic  workers and requests that staff members be informed of those requirements and the  importance of abiding by them through participation in the Domestic Worker Program.   3.  The employment of non-immigrant domestic workers by United Nations staff  members is designated as a benefit under the Foreign Missions Act. Therefore, any  staff member who sponsors a domestic worker under a G-5 visa must abide by all the  Domestic Worker Program requirements, including the new requirements contained  in annex I. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the diplomatic notes in annexes I  and II, staff members sponsoring a domestic worker on a G-5 visa must cover the  medical expenses of the domestic worker. Staff members are responsible for  providing adequate medical insurance and covering any medical expenses of the  domestic worker. Staff members shall furnish the United Nations, annually and/or  upon request, with proof that they have purchased adequate medical insurance for  their domestic workers to cover extraordinary medical costs. The United Nations shall  not be responsible, financially or otherwise, for medical expenses and/or costs arising  from injury or illness of a domestic worker.  4.  In addition, domestic workers on a G-5 visa sponsored by staff members of the  United Nations are expected not to be accompanied by a dependent.   5.  Staff members participating in the Domestic Worker Program are required to  use form P.210 AA to enter into, amend and/or renew existing employment contracts  with a domestic worker on a G-5 visa.        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice and complements ST/IC/2017/32,  ST/IC/2014/19, ST/IC/2012/7 and ST/IC/2009/42.

The United States Mission wishes to remind the United Nations Secretariat of  these requirements and to request that all staff members of the United Nations again  be apprised of the Department of State's requirements relating to the hiring of  domestic workers and the importance of all the staff members of the United Nations  abiding by them through participation in the Department's Domestic Worker Program.    The Department of State has emphasized to the United Nations Secretariat that  it places a high priority on the fair and equitable treatment of domestic workers, and  that the Department looks to the United Nations Secretariat to provide oversight of  staff members who employ these workers.    The United States Mission wishes to inform that the employment of  non-immigrant domestic workers by staff members of the United Nations has been  designated a benefit under the Foreign Missions Act. This benefit shall be provided  on such terms and conditions as the Department of State may approve. As before, any  staff member of the United Nations who sponsors a domestic worker must abide by  all programme requirements, including new requirements (see enclosure). From this  date forward, if such requirements are not fully met, the Department may suspend  participation in the programme by declining to accept pre-notification requests of  upcoming domestic workers, or for all staff members if warranted by the  circumstances.    Please note that the attached designation does not impair the authority of the  Secretary of State to suspend, in appropriate circumstances, the issuance of G-5 visas  to domestic workers seeking to work for officers or employees of an international  organization under the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008.     Please contact UNDomesticWorkers@state.gov for any questions.       ST/IC/2020/11      20-05434  4/11    Enclosure       Domestic Worker Program Requirements        Foreign mission members and international organization personnel who employ  a foreign domestic worker (""employers"") must abide by all requirements of the  Domestic Worker Program and must respect all applicable United States federal, state,  and local laws and regulations.    In addition, the Office of the Chief of Protocol requires that employers accept  and comply with the following Domestic Worker Program requirements: 1    * Facilitation of their domestic workers' participation in the forthcoming  Domestic Worker In-Person Registration Program;    * Provision of assistance, as needed, to the domestic worker to establish a bank  account in the United States in his/her name only;    * After the first 30 days of employment in the United States, payment of salary  made exclusively by check or electronic funds transfer to the domestic worker's  bank account in the United States;    * Provision of a payslip at the time of wage payment to the domestic worker  noting the hourly wage, overtime wage, and the number of hours worked in the  pay period and any required deductions to fulfil tax and social security  obligations. No other deductions are permitted;    * Maintenance of contemporaneous timekeeping and payment records and the  retention of such records for three years after employment ends, as well as  provision of copies of the records to the Department of State upon request;    * Establishment of employment contracts that include all Department required  terms, in English and if the domestic worker does not understand English, in a  language the domestic worker understands;    * Timely request, through the employer's foreign mission or international  organization, of extensions of G-5 status for the domestic worker prior to  expiration of the domestic worker's authorized period of stay in the United  States, such that there is sufficient time to allow such requests to be processed  before the expiration of the domestic worker's authorized period of stay;    * Prohibition of all salary deductions, except as required by law;     * Exclusive employment of the domestic worker by the employer who signed the  contract; and,    * Provision of at least 35 hours a week of compensated employment.    The following are new, additional Domestic Worker Program requirements:    * Employers may not be related to the domestic worker they employ (exceptions may  be made on a case-by-case basis, e.g., for the care of a disabled family member);    * Employers or the employer's foreign mission or international organization must  cover the medical expenses of domestic workers while they are in the United  States;    * Employers under investigation for abuse or exploitation of a domestic worker or a  pattern of repeated domestic worker terminations will not be eligible to participate  in the Domestic Worker Program unless and until the matter is resolved;  __________________    1  Not all of these requirements are in the required contract terms.    ST/IC/2020/11    5/11  20-05434      * The  Secretary-General, Assistant-  and  Under-Secretaries-General  may  generally sponsor only two domestic workers. Other qualified employers may  generally sponsor only one domestic worker. Members of the support and  service staff may generally not sponsor any; and,    * Missions and international organizations that wish to participate in the Domestic  Workers Program must agree that if any of their personnel request that a  domestic worker be accompanied by a dependent, the mission/international  organization will submit a Dependent Protection and Oversight Plan signed by  the Chief of Mission/senior international organization official to accompany the  pre-notification request. The Plan must include regular monitoring of the  dependent's welfare and living conditions, with increased oversight for minors,  and written semi-annual certification by the employee, the employer, and the  employer's mission/international organization that the dependent is not working  in the United States.    While these are the current Domestic Worker Program requirements, we  anticipate that this framework will evolve in the future based on changing  circumstances. The United Nations Secretariat will be provided reasonable notice of  changes.

The United States Mission wishes to remind the United Nations Secretariat of  these requirements and to request that all staff members of the United Nations again  be apprised of the Department of State's requirements relating to the hiring of  domestic workers and the importance of all the staff members of the United Nations  abiding by them through participation in the Department's Domestic Worker Program.    The Department of State has emphasized to the United Nations Secretariat that  it places a high priority on the fair and equitable treatment of domestic workers, and  that the Department looks to the United Nations Secretariat to provide oversight of  staff members who employ these workers.     The United States Mission wishes to inform that the employment of  non-immigrant domestic workers by staff members of the United Nations has been  designated a benefit under the Foreign Missions Act.

ST/IC/2020/11    9/11  20-05434    Annex III        Diplomatic note dated 17 April 2019 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  Permanent Missions and Observer Offices to the United Nations and has the honour  to announce the official commencement of the In-Person Registration Program for  domestic workers employed by United Nations Permanent Missions and Observer  Offices personnel. The programme was referenced in circular diplomatic note  HC-88-18, dated 28 November 2018. The initial phase of this registration program  pertains to G-5 visa holders employed by members of Permanent Missions and  Observer Offices to the United Nations. The programme will be expanded at a future  date to include domestic workers employed by United Nations personnel.    The registration programme will commence in May 2019, beginning with  domestic workers employed by Permanent Mission members who arrived in the New  York metropolitan area on or after 1 January 2019. Representatives of the United  States Mission Host Country Affairs Office will contact appropriate Permanent  Missions to schedule appointments for domestic workers holding G-5 visas whose  arrival falls within this time frame. The programme will subsequently expand to  include G-5 visa holders previously registered and residing in the New York City  metropolitan area prior to 1 January 2019. Permanent Missions will be individually  notified of the requirement to schedule these later appointments.    The United Nations Office of Protocol must be notified using the SG.5 form  within five days of the worker's arrival into the United States. Upon receipt of the  official United Nations notification of registration, the United States Mission Host  Country Affairs Office will contact the Permanent Mission to schedule a registration  appointment. Appointments will generally take place within 30 days of a domestic  worker's arrival into the United States, and subsequently on at least an annual basis  for the duration of the domestic worker's employment by the mission member. Please  note that domestic workers will be issued a registration card that will be renewed at  the time of the worker's annual registration appointment.    All appointment schedules and queries concerning the In-Person Registration  Program will be handled through a designated Permanent Mission point of contact  with responsibility for domestic worker matters. This policy is intended to assist both  the United States Mission and the Permanent Missions in ensuring compliance with  Domestic Worker Program requirements. Permanent Missions that have at least one  staff member that employs a domestic worker are requested to inform the United  States Mission Host Country Affairs Office in a timely manner of the designated point  of contact for domestic worker matters.    For its record keeping purposes, the United States Mission Host Country Affairs  Office will track annual registration renewal dates. However, please note that it may  be of benefit for Permanent Missions to develop an internal system to monitor renewal  requirements. Similarly, it may prove beneficial for Permanent Missions to establish  oversight and protection mechanisms, including by, inter alia, maintaining copies of  employment contracts, and having the ability to access payment records should any  disputes arise between a mission member and a domestic worker.    In-person registration appointments will be held at the United States Mission to  the United Nations, 799 United Nations Plaza, where the domestic worker will be met  in the building lobby by an accreditations officer. Employers and other mission or  office representatives will not participate in the registration appointment.  Interpretation services will be available for all registrants that require them.  ST/IC/2020/11      20-05434  10/11      At the registration appointment, the domestic worker should present his or her  passport, a copy of the employment contract, and documentation confirming that a  bank account in the United States has been established in his or her name only. As  notified in circular diplomatic note HC-88-18, mission members must begin paying  their domestic workers by check or electronic fund transfer within 30 days of the  domestic worker's arrival into the United States. If a United States bank account has  not yet been opened at the time of the registration appointment, the domestic worker  will be required to return to the United States Mission at a later date to provide the  requested information relating to the establishment of an account.    The United States Mission recognizes that as this new programme is initiated,  missions may have questions related to programme and process details. For this  reason, representatives of the United States Mission Host Country Affairs Office are  available to respond to queries and provide support for a successful partnership with  the United Nations community on matters relating to the employment of domestic  workers. Questions may be directed to UNDomesticWorkers@state.gov.    The United States Mission and the diplomatic community share common goals  in this endeavour, which include furthering collaboration in the obligation to protect  foreign domestic workers brought to the United States to work for foreign mission  personnel. It is important to continue joint efforts to ensure that all domestic workers  understand their rights and protections, and that those employing these workers  understand their contractual obligations and responsibilities.        ST/IC/2020/11    11/11  20-05434    Annex IV       Diplomatic note dated 13 January 2020 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations addressed to the Secretariat         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to refer to its circular diplomatic note  HC-94-(S)-18 dated 6 December 2018 (available at: https://usun.state.gov/6659)  regarding the employment of domestic workers who are in the United States in  non-immigrant G-5 status. The United Nations Secretariat will note that for all hours  worked, such domestic workers must be paid the greater of the minimum wage under  United States federal or state law or the wage in the specific location (city and state)  of the residence where the domestic worker is employed.    The United States Mission wishes to inform the United Nations Secretariat that  according to article 19 of the New York State Labor Law, all employees in New York  State, including domestic workers, must be paid at least the applicable hourly wage rate.  The City of New York has updated its minimum wage requirement to $15 per hour for  the period beginning 31 December 2019 and ending 30 December 2020. The current  minimum wage rate for Long Island and Westchester is $13, and in the remainder of New  York State it is $11.80 for each hour worked. The current minimum wage rate in the State  of New York may be found online at the New York State Department of Labor website  (https://www.labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/workprot/minwage.shtm).     In accordance with New Jersey Statutes Annotated 34:11-56a4c, effective  1 January 2020 and ending 31 December 2020, the State of New Jersey has updated  its minimum wage to $10.30 for each hour worked for employers with less than six  employees. The current minimum wage rate and further information on scheduled  increases may be found online at the New Jersey's Department Labor website  (https://www.nj.gov/labor/wagehour/wagehour_index.html).     In accordance with Connecticut General Statute SS31-58, as amended by Public Act  19-4, effective 1 October 2019, the Connecticut Department of Labor has increased its  minimum wage to $11 for each hour worked. Public Law 19-4 includes additional future  increases in the minimum wage rate, including a scheduled increase to $12 per hour,  effective 1 September 2020. The current minimum wage rate and further information on  scheduled increases may be found online at the Connecticut Department of Labor  website (http://ctdol.state.ct.us/wgwkstnd/wage-hour/pay002.htm).     Therefore, domestic workers employed in residences in the States of  Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, must be paid in accordance with the local  minimum wage rates noted above. In addition, all new contracts between domestic  workers and their employers must reflect the updated wage amounts and all existing  contracts already in effect must be amended to reflect the updated wage amounts, with  the changes initialled by both the domestic worker and the employer.

The diplomatic notes  contain a reminder of the policies regarding employment of domestic workers,  including new requirements, the commencement of the In-Person Registration  Program for domestic workers employed by United Nations staff members and  updated minimum wages for domestic workers on a G-5 visa in the States of  Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.  3.

Annex III        Diplomatic note dated 18 May 2020 from the United States Mission to the  United Nations       The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to announce the official  commencement of the In-Person Registration Program for domestic workers  employed by United Nations personnel. The programme was referenced in circular  note HnC-88-(S)-18, dated 28 November 2018.       * The present circular will be in effect until further notice and complements ST/IC/2017/32,  ST/IC/2014/19, ST/IC/2012/7 and ST/IC/2009/42. ST/IC/2019/21 is superseded.  ST/IC/2020/11/Amend.1      20-10707  2/2      The registration programme will commence in May 2020, beginning with  domestic workers employed by United Nations personnel who arrived in the  New York metropolitan area on or after 1 December 2019.

All appointment schedules and queries concerning the In-person Registration  Program will be handled through the United Nations Visa Committee's point of  contact with responsibility for domestic worker matters. This policy is intended to  assist both the United States Mission and the United Nations in ensuring compliance  with Domestic Worker Program requirements.     For its record keeping purposes, the United States Mission Host Country Affairs  Office will track annual registration renewal dates. However, please note that it may  be of benefit for the United Nations Visa Committee to develop an internal system to  monitor renewal requirements. Similarly, it may prove beneficial for the United  Nations Visa Committee to establish oversight and protection mechanisms, including  by, inter alia, maintaining copies of employment contracts, and having the ability to  access payment records should any disputes arise between a United Nations staff  member and a domestic worker.     At present, as a result of the pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease  (COVID-19) and current social distancing restrictions, the initial appointment for new  arrivals will be conducted either by telephone or video-conferencing with a member  of the Host Country Affairs Office. Once the current restrictions are no longer in  place, the In-Person Registration Program will resume and the registration  appointments will be held at the United States Mission to the United Nations.     As notified in circular note HC-88-(S)-18, UN staff members must begin paying  their domestic workers by check or electronic fund transfer within 30 days of the  domestic worker's arrival into the United States. If a United States bank account has  not yet been opened at the time of the registration appointment, the domestic worker  will be required to return to the United States Mission at a later date to provide the  requested information relating to the establishment of an account.     The United States Mission recognizes that as this new programme is initiated,  United Nations personnel may have questions related to programme and process  details. For this reason, representatives of the United States Mission Host Country  Affairs Office are available to respond to queries and provide support for a successful  partnership with the United Nations community via the United Nations Visa  Committee on matters relating to the employment of domestic workers.

The following are new, additional Domestic Worker Program requirements:    * Employers may not be related to the domestic worker they employ (exceptions may  be made on a case-by-case basis, e.g., for the care of a disabled family member);    * Employers or the employer's foreign mission or international organization must  cover the medical expenses of domestic workers while they are in the United  States;    * Employers under investigation for abuse or exploitation of a domestic worker or a  pattern of repeated domestic worker terminations will not be eligible to participate  in the Domestic Worker Program unless and until the matter is resolved;  __________________    1  Not all of these requirements are in the required contract terms.    ST/IC/2020/11    5/11  20-05434      * The Secretary-General, Assistant-  and  Under-Secretaries-General  may  generally sponsor only two domestic workers. Other qualified employers may  generally sponsor only one domestic worker. Members of the support and  service staff may generally not sponsor any; and,    * Missions and international organizations that wish to participate in the Domestic  Workers Program must agree that if any of their personnel request that a  domestic worker be accompanied by a dependent, the mission/international  organization will submit a Dependent Protection and Oversight Plan signed by  the Chief of Mission/senior international organization official to accompany the  pre-notification request. The Plan must include regular monitoring of the  dependent's welfare and living conditions, with increased oversight for minors,  and written semi-annual certification by the employee, the employer, and the  employer's mission/international organization that the dependent is not working  in the United States.    While these are the current Domestic Worker Program requirements, we  anticipate that this framework will evolve in the future based on changing  circumstances. The United Nations Secretariat will be provided reasonable notice of  changes.     ST/IC/2020/11      20-05434  6/11    Annex II       Diplomatic note dated 23 January 2020 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations addressed to the Secretariat         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to refer to its previous circular  diplomatic notes HC-59-(S)-14 dated 6 June 2014 and HC-88-(S)-18 dated  28 November 2018 that set forth the legal requirements and Department of State  policies regarding the employment of foreign domestic workers by United Nations  staff members and to provide a point of contact for the Domestic Worker Program.    The United States Mission wishes to remind the United Nations Secretariat of  these requirements and to request that all staff members of the United Nations again  be apprised of the Department of State's requirements relating to the hiring of  domestic workers and the importance of all the staff members of the United Nations  abiding by them through participation in the Department's Domestic Worker Program.     The Department of State has emphasized to the United Nations Secretariat that  it places a high priority on the fair and equitable treatment of domestic workers, and  that the Department looks to the United Nations Secretariat to provide oversight of  staff members who employ these workers.     The United States Mission wishes to inform that the employment of  non-immigrant domestic workers by staff members of the United Nations has been  designated a benefit under the Foreign Missions Act. This benefit shall be provided  on such terms and conditions as the Department of State may approve. As before, any  staff member of the United Nations who sponsors a domestic worker must abide by  all programme requirements, including new requirements (please see enclosure).  From this date forward, if such requirements are not fully met, the Department may  suspend participation in the program by declining to accept pre-notification requests  of upcoming domestic workers, or for all staff members if warranted by the  circumstances.    Please note that the attached designation does not impair the authority of the  Secretary of State to suspend, in appropriate circumstances, the issuance of G-5 visas  to domestic workers seeking to work for officers or employees of an international  organization under the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008.    Please contact Rebecca Shivprasod, Program Specialist, Host Country Affairs  at shivprasodr@state.gov or UNDomesticWorkers@state.gov for any questions.

ST/IC/2020/11      20-05434  8/11      * The Secretary-General, Assistant-  and  Under-Secretaries-General  may  generally sponsor only two domestic workers.

The United Nations Secretariat will be provided reasonable notice of  changes.        ST/IC/2020/11    9/11  20-05434    Annex III         Diplomatic note dated 18 May 2020 from the United States Mission to the  United Nations       The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to announce the official  commencement of the In-Person Registration Program for domestic workers  employed by United Nations personnel. The programme was referenced in circular  note HnC-88-(S)-18, dated 28 November 2018.     The registration programme will commence in May 2020, beginning with  domestic workers employed by United Nations personnel who arrived in the  New York metropolitan area on or after 1 December 2019. Representatives of the  United States Mission Host Country Affairs Office will contact appropriate United  Nations staff members to schedule appointments for domestic workers holding  G-5 visas whose arrival falls within this time frame. The programme will  subsequently expand to include G-5 visa holders previously registered and residing  in the New York City metropolitan area prior to 1 December 2019; personnel of the  United Nations will be individually notified of the requirement to schedule these later  appointments.     All appointment schedules and queries concerning the In-person Registration  Program will be handled through the United Nations Visa Committee's point of  contact with responsibility for domestic worker matters. This policy is intended to  assist both the United States Mission and the United Nations in ensuring compliance  with Domestic Worker Program requirements.     For its record keeping purposes, the United States Mission Host Country Affairs  Office will track annual registration renewal dates. However, please note that it may  be of benefit for the United Nations Visa Committee to develop an internal system to  monitor renewal requirements. Similarly, it may prove beneficial for the United  Nations Visa Committee to establish oversight and protection mechanisms, including  by, inter alia, maintaining copies of employment contracts, and having the ability to  access payment records should any disputes arise between a United Nations staff  member and a domestic worker.     At present, as a result of the pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease  (COVID-19) and current social distancing restrictions, the initial appointment for new  arrivals will be conducted either by telephone or video-conferencing with a member  of the Host Country Affairs Office. Once the current restrictions are no longer in  place, the In-Person Registration Program will resume and the registration  appointments will be held at the United States Mission to the United Nations.     As notified in circular note HC-88-(S)-18, UN staff members must begin paying  their domestic workers by check or electronic fund transfer within 30 days of the  domestic worker's arrival into the United States. If a United States bank account has  not yet been opened at the time of the registration appointment, the domestic worker  will be required to return to the United States Mission at a later date to provide the  requested information relating to the establishment of an account.     The United States Mission recognizes that as this new programme is initiated,  United Nations personnel may have questions related to programme and process  details. For this reason, representatives of the United States Mission Host Country  Affairs Office are available to respond to queries and provide support for a successful  partnership with the United Nations community via the United Nations Visa  Committee on matters relating to the employment of domestic workers. Questions  may be directed to UNDomesticWorkers@state.gov.  ST/IC/2020/11      20-05434  10/11      The United States Mission and the United Nations community share common  goals in this endeavour, which include furthering collaboration in the obligation to  protect foreign domestic workers brought to the United States to work for United  Nations personnel. It is important to continue joint efforts to ensure that all domestic  workers understand their rights and protections, and that those employing these  workers understand their contractual obligations and responsibilities.         ST/IC/2020/11    11/11  20-05434    Annex IV       Diplomatic note dated 13 January 2020 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations addressed to the Secretariat         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to refer to its circular diplomatic note  HC-94-(S)-18 dated 6 December 2018 (available at: https://usun.state.gov/6659)  regarding the employment of domestic workers who are in the United States in  non-immigrant G-5 status. The United Nations Secretariat will note that for all hours  worked, such domestic workers must be paid the greater of the minimum wage under  United States federal or state law or the wage in the specific location (city and state)  of the residence where the domestic worker is employed.    The United States Mission wishes to inform the United Nations Secretariat that  according to article 19 of the New York State Labor Law, all employees in New York  State, including domestic workers, must be paid at least the applicable hourly wage rate.  The City of New York has updated its minimum wage requirement to $15 per hour for  the period beginning 31 December 2019 and ending 30 December 2020. The current  minimum wage rate for Long Island and Westchester is $13, and in the remainder of New  York State it is $11.80 for each hour worked. The current minimum wage rate in the State  of New York may be found online at the New York State Department of Labor website  (https://www.labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/workprot/minwage.shtm).     In accordance with New Jersey Statutes Annotated 34:11-56a4c, effective  1 January 2020 and ending 31 December 2020, the State of New Jersey has updated  its minimum wage to $10.30 for each hour worked for employers with less than six  employees. The current minimum wage rate and further information on scheduled  increases may be found online at the New Jersey's Department Labor website  (https://www.nj.gov/labor/wagehour/wagehour_index.html).     In accordance with Connecticut General Statute SS31-58, as amended by Public Act  19-4, effective 1 October 2019, the Connecticut Department of Labor has increased its  minimum wage to $11 for each hour worked. Public Law 19-4 includes additional future  increases in the minimum wage rate, including a scheduled increase to $12 per hour,  effective 1 September 2020. The current minimum wage rate and further information on  scheduled increases may be found online at the Connecticut Department of Labor  website (http://ctdol.state.ct.us/wgwkstnd/wage-hour/pay002.htm).     Therefore, domestic workers employed in residences in the States of  Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, must be paid in accordance with the local  minimum wage rates noted above. In addition, all new contracts between domestic  workers and their employers must reflect the updated wage amounts and all existing  contracts already in effect must be amended to reflect the updated wage amounts, with  the changes initialled by both the domestic worker and the employer.

Additional shipment entitlements for international staff serving at designated  duty stations     9.4 Internationally recruited staff members holding a fixed-term or continuing  appointment serving at duty stations designated by the International Civil Service  Commission shall have the following special entitlements in accordance with the  provisions of the administrative instruction on special entitlements for staff  members serving at designated duty stations and as set out in an information  circular on classification of duty stations and special entitlements for staff members  serving at designated duty stations:    (a)  An additional yearly shipment to the duty station in the amount of  50 kilograms or 0.31 cubic metres for the staff member and each eligible family  member for whom the Organization has paid travel costs to the duty station;    (b)  For staff assigned to a family duty station, an additional 50 kilograms or  0.31 cubic metres of shipment to the duty station in connection with the birth or  adoption of an infant;    (c)  When  exercising  their  unaccompanied  shipment  entitlement  of  50 kilograms or 0.31 cubic metres on home leave, family visit or education grant  travel, or their alternative entitlement to increased accompanied excess baggage  under section 5 above, internationally recruited staff members serving at designated  duty stations may combine the shipment entitlements associated with both legs of  the travel into one shipment;    (d)  The cost of transporting a privately owned motor vehicle to one of the  duty stations designated for that purpose, as listed in the information circular on  transportation of privately owned automobiles, may be partially reimbursed under  the conditions provided in section 20 below.        Shipment entitlement of staff members assigned, reassigned or transferred from a  family to a non-family duty station     9.5 When an internationally recruited staff member holding a fixed-term or  continuing appointment is reassigned or transferred from a family duty station to a  non-family duty station for one year or longer, only the staff member himself or  herself shall be entitled to the payment of costs associated with the shipment of his  or her personal effects and household goods of up to the maximum amount provided  in section 9.3 (a) above to the non-family duty station by the most economical  means.  9.6 When an internationally recruited staff member holding a fixed-term or  continuing appointment is reassigned or transferred from a family to a non-family  duty station for a period of one year or longer, he or she may be entitled to the  payment of the cost of unaccompanied shipment in respect of his or her eligible  family members who are authorized to travel to the home country for the purpose of  relocation in the amounts set out in sections 9.3 (b) and 9.3 (c) above to the  authorized destination. The transportation cost of the unaccompanied shipment  provided under the present section shall not exceed the cost of transportation  between the family duty station and the staff member's place of home leave.  ST/AI/2016/4      16-11297  6/19    9.7 When an internationally recruited staff member holding a fixed-term or  continuing appointment is temporarily assigned from a family duty station to a  non-family duty station and eligible family members are authorized to travel on  one-way advance home leave travel, the shipping entitlement applicable to home  leave travel under section 7.1 (a) shall apply.         Part III     Relocation shipment           Section 10      Eligibility     10.1 An entitlement to relocation shipment for full removal of personal effects and  household goods shall arise in respect of service at a headquarters duty station or  other duty station classified in the same category in the following circumstances:    (a)  On initial appointment for a period of two years or longer;    (b)  On change of duty station, provided that the staff member is expected to  serve, from the beginning of the appointment or assignment, at the new duty station  for a period of two years or longer;    (c)  On separation from service, provided that the staff member had an  appointment for a period of two years or longer or had completed not less than two  years of continuous service, and:    (i)  Had been granted relocation shipment to the duty station or a prior duty  station in the course of a period of uninterrupted service; or    (ii) Had been recruited at the duty station from which he or she was  separating and was repatriating to the place of home leave or other location in  accordance with staff rule 7.1 (b).  No entitlement to relocation shipment shall arise with respect to service at a  non-family duty station or a duty station not classified as a headquarters duty station. 7   10.2 A staff member who is eligible for relocation shipment under section 10.1  above shall be entitled, by the most economical means, to:    (a)  a standard 20-foot container (equivalent to 33.2 cubic metres) for a staff  member without a spouse or dependent child;    (b)  a standard 40-foot container (equivalent to 67.7 cubic metres) for a staff  member with a spouse or dependent child residing at the official duty station.  10.3 A staff member may opt not to exercise his or her entitlement to relocation  shipment provided in section 10.2 above and instead elect for payment of  unaccompanied shipment of personal effects and household goods provided in section  9.3 above, or for the relocation grant under part V below. However, the staff member  __________________    7  Under International Civil Service Commission hardship classification standards,  ""H"" (headquarters) category comprises headquarters duty stations and other duty stations in  similar locations where the United Nations has no developmental or humanitarian assistance  programmes or in member countries of the European Union. These duty stations are listed in the  information circular on classification of duty stations and special entitlements for staff members  serving at designated duty stations (see ST/IC/2015/3 or as amended).    ST/AI/2016/4    7/19  16-11297    will no longer be entitled to relocation shipment when he or she separates from service  from the initial duty station that gave rise to the entitlement to relocation shipment.  Nonetheless, the relocation shipment entitlement may be reinstated if the staff member  is subsequently assigned to a new duty station that gives rise to the entitlement.        Storage of personal effects and household goods     10.4 When a staff member who was granted relocation shipment pursuant to section  10.1 is assigned to a new duty station that does not give rise to an entitlement to  relocation shipment, or from a duty station at which he or she had a relocation  shipment entitlement or would have had such entitlement on appointment from  outside the duty station, the United Nations shall pay the costs of storage of  personal effects and household goods, provided that:    (a)  The quantity of personal effects and household goods stored does not  exceed the difference between the maximum allowance in cubic metres under section  10.2 and the amount in cubic metres actually shipped under section 9.3 above; and    (b)  The charges do not extend beyond the five-year period (including any  period of special leave without pay) following the effective date of the assignment.  However, when a staff member's assignment is extended beyond five years for a  period of up to two years at the same duty station, storage charges may continue to  be paid for the period of such extension.  10.5 Pursuant to section 10.4 above, the charges to be paid shall include insurance  coverage as provided in section 23.4 below.  10.6 Storage charges shall not be paid in the case of assignments not involving a  change of official duty station.         Part IV     Conditions that apply to both unaccompanied shipment and  relocation shipment           Section 11      Loss of entitlement to unaccompanied shipment or relocation shipment     11.1 A staff member who, upon separation from service, is not entitled to payment  of return travel expenses for himself or herself, and their eligible family members if  applicable, shall not be entitled to payment of excess baggage, unaccompanied  shipment or relocation shipment under the provisions of the present instruction.  11.2 Upon separation from service, entitlement to unaccompanied shipment or  relocation shipment shall cease if the shipment has not commenced within two years  of the date of separation.  11.3 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11.2 above, where both spouses are  staff members and the spouse who separates first is entitled to unaccompanied  shipment or relocation shipment, his or her entitlement shall not cease until two  years after the date of separation of the other spouse.  11.4 A resignation after completing less than one year of service, or two years of  service for staff entitled to relocation shipment, shall result in the loss of  ST/AI/2016/4      16-11297  8/19    unaccompanied shipment under section 9.3 above and the loss of relocation  shipment under section 10.2 above on separation from service.  11.5 The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management may  determine that there are compelling circumstances that do not warrant the loss or  adjustment of the relocation shipment entitlement under section 11.4 above.        Section 12      Personal effects and household goods     12.1 The transportation of privately owned automobiles may be partially  reimbursed under the provisions of section 20 of the present instruction.  12.2 Unaccompanied shipment or relocation shipment shall be subject to the  following conditions:    (a)  Flammable and hazardous materials shall in no case be shipped at the  expense of the Organization or be included in any shipment that it has arranged;    (b)  The personal effects and household goods to be transported must be for  the staff member's use or for that of his or her eligible family members;    (c)  For relocation shipments, the personal effects and household goods must  have been in the staff member's possession at the time of his or her appointment,  change of duty station or separation, as applicable.        Section 13      Determination of weight or volume maxima     13.1 The weight or volume maxima of a staff member's shipment entitlements are  determined in accordance with the provisions of the present instruction. When  crating or lift vans are not used, but goods are packed into suitcases, cartons or  trunks, the total weight or volume of the suitcases, cartons or trunks shall be  considered the net weight or volume.  13.2 A staff member will be considered to be within his or her entitlement if the  shipment does not exceed either the weight or volume allowable under the  provisions of the present instruction. If the shipment exceeds both the weight and  volume maxima specified in the present instruction and additional charges are  incurred as a result, the charges to be paid by the staff member shall be calculated  on the basis of the ratio of the lesser amount of the excess net figure to the total net  figure of the weight or volume shipped.  13.3 If the packing company cannot provide a weight or volume figure in net terms,  that is, inclusive only of packing, as well as gross terms, that is, inclusive also of  crating and lift vans, the net weight or volume shall be determined on the basis of  two thirds of the gross weight or volume of the shipment. The Organization shall in  no case recognize any difference between gross and net weight or volume that  exceeds one third of the gross weight or volume. Should the crating exceed one  third of the gross weight or volume, the difference shall be considered as part of the  net shipment.  13.4 The unaccompanied shipment entitlements exercised under section 7.1 (a), 8.1  and 9.1 above shall not include the payment of the cost of packing, crating, lift  vans, unpacking and uncarting. Only the cost of cartage shall be paid.    ST/AI/2016/4    9/19  16-11297        Section 14      Payment of costs related to shipment       Payment of costs related to the shipment shall be in accordance with the  provisions of the present instruction. The following costs shall not be payable:    (a)  Import and export duties;    (b)  Delivery from a storage warehouse to the staff member's residence,  unless storage at United Nations expense has been authorized;    (c)  Storage and demurrage charges shall not be paid unless, in the opinion of  the Secretary-General, they are directly incidental to the transportation of the  consignment.        Section 15      Mode of transportation and conversion to alternative modes     15.1 Shipment shall be made by the most economical means, as determined by the  Secretary-General, in which case the full entitlement provided by the Staff Rules  and the present instruction shall apply, regardless of the mode of transportation.  15.2 When surface shipment is the most economical means of transport, conversion  to air shipment may be authorized in accordance with the following provisions:    (a)  On the basis of one half the weight or volume of the surface entitlement:    (i)  The entire surface shipment entitlement under sections 7, 8 and 9 may be  converted to air freight at the request of the staff member;    (ii) Part of the surface shipment entitlement under sections 7, 8 and 9 may be  converted to air freight, provided the Secretary-General determines that such  partial conversion is necessary to meet urgent needs. However, no partial  conversion shall be authorized for the 50 kilograms or 0.31 cubic metres  shipment entitlement on home leave, family visit or education grant travel  under section 7.1 (a);    (b)  Exceptionally, the surface entitlement under sections 7, 8 and 9 may be  converted to air freight on the basis of the full weight and volume:    (i)  When the Secretary-General determines that there is an extraordinary  risk of damage to, or loss of, a surface shipment in transit;    (ii) When a staff member is appointed or assigned to a non-family duty  station for a period of six months or longer but less than one year, and the  Secretary-General determines that this is justified by the operational  requirements of the assignment;    (iii) When the normal shipping time would exceed three months, except for  shipments on home leave, family visit or education grant travel under section  7.1 (a) above;    (c)  A portion of up to 10 per cent of the surface entitlement under section 9.3  above may be converted to air freight on the basis of full weight or volume on  appointment, on assignment of more than one year or on transfer, provided the staff  member is appointed, assigned or transferred to a duty station other than a  ST/AI/2016/4      16-11297  10/19    headquarters duty station or other duty station classified in the same category. No  conversion under the present subsection shall be made on separation from service;    (d)  If a portion of the surface shipment entitlement is converted to air freight  on the basis of full weight and volume under section 15.2 (c) above, the remaining  surface shipment entitlement may be converted to air freight on the basis of the one- half rule.         Part V     Terms and conditions that govern the application of relocation grant          Section 16      General     16.1 On travel on appointment, assignment, transfer or separation from service,  internationally recruited staff members entitled to unaccompanied shipment or  relocation shipment may opt for a lump-sum payment in lieu of the entitlement  provided in sections 8.1, 9.1, 9.3 and 10.2 above. This lump-sum option shall be  known as a ""relocation grant"".  16.2 The relocation grant shall not apply to movements within the same country or  within the same mission area, irrespective of whether the mission area covers  multiple countries. In such instances, staff members shall retain their shipment  entitlement prescribed in the present instruction. Wherever feasible, United Nations  transportation facilities shall be utilized for the shipment of the staff member 's  personal effects and household goods at no cost to the staff member.  16.3 The relocation grant shall be determined at rates set out in a separate information  circular. The payment of the relocation grant at the dependant rate on appointment,  assignment or transfer pursuant to section 16.1, shall be subject to the arrival of at  least one eligible family member who travelled to the duty station at the expense of  the Organization more than six months prior to the expected end of the service at the  duty station. Upon separation from service, the payment of relocation grant at the  dependant rate shall be subject to the departure of at least one eligible family member  who travelled from the duty station at the expense of the Organization.   16.4 The relocation grant amount is based on the staff member's recognized status  at the time of the relocation. It is not subject to adjustment afterwards, except as  provided in section 17.5. Consequently, a change in the staff member 's status (that  is, marriage, divorce, newborn child, adoption, a child who ceases to be a  recognized dependant or any other change in the staff member's personal status)  after the relocation grant has been paid will not give rise to an additional payment at  that duty station. Any new entitlement may be paid only on the next relocation.  16.5 Except as provided under section 18.1, the relocation grant shall not be  available on a partial basis and shall not be combined with the unaccompanied  shipment or relocation shipment entitlements. By opting for the relocation grant, a  staff member agrees to waive the entitlement to unaccompanied shipment or  relocation shipment that would otherwise apply.  16.6 No proof of how the relocation grant is used is required. Its use is at the  discretion of the staff member, in any manner deemed best to facilitate his or her  relocation.    ST/AI/2016/4    11/19  16-11297    16.7 The Organization is not responsible for any delays in the arrival of personal  effects or household goods or additional expenses that may be incurred or liabilities  that may arise as a result of opting for the relocation grant. It is the staff member 's  responsibility to take out appropriate insurance. Where possible, the Organization  may assist staff members in facilitating customs clearance and applicable  import/export procedures.        Section 17      Conditions of the relocation grant         Staff holding temporary appointments     17.1 On travel on appointment or separation from service, staff members who are  regarded as internationally recruited and granted a temporary appointment may opt for  the relocation grant in lieu of their shipment entitlement provided in section 8.1,  subject to the conditions of section 8.2. Pursuant to section 8.3, the exceptional  extension of a temporary appointment to reach a period of one year, or up to a  maximum of 729 days, shall not give rise to any further payment of the relocation  grant.   17.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8.2 above, a staff member who is  internationally recruited and granted a temporary appointment may be entitled to  payment of the difference between the relocation grant payable in lieu of shipment  of personal effects under section 9.3 and the amount paid in lieu of shipment of  personal effects under section 8.1 if the staff member is subsequently granted a  fixed-term appointment of one year or longer at the same duty station.  17.3 In compliance with section 8.2, a staff member who is offered successive  temporary appointments shall be eligible to opt for the relocation grant in lieu of the  unaccompanied shipment only when at least three months have elapsed between  separation and re-employment on the subsequent temporary appointment at the  same duty station.        Staff holding an appointment other than a temporary appointment on assignment of  less than one year     17.4 For an assignment of less than one year, a staff member holding an appointment  other than a temporary appointment, who is entitled to unaccompanied shipment, may  opt for the relocation grant in lieu of the shipment entitlement provided in section 9.1  above. When an assignment of less than one year is subsequently extended so that the  total period reaches one year or longer, inclusive of the period of payment of a daily  subsistence allowance, the staff member may be entitled to payment of the difference  between the amount payable in lieu of unaccompanied shipment entitlements under  section 9.3 above and the amount paid in lieu of shipment of personal effects under  section 9.1. The payment of the balance of the relocation grant shall be made only  when the extension of the assignment occurs at least six months prior to the expected  end of the assignment at the duty station.        When both spouses are staff members of the United Nations or the United Nations  common system     17.5 When both spouses are staff members of the United Nations or another  organization of the United Nations common system, upon travel on appointment,  ST/AI/2016/4      16-11297  12/19    change in duty station or separation from service at the expense of the Organization  the relocation grant option shall be administered as follows:        Travel to the same duty station       (a)  When both staff members travel to the same duty station at the same  time, with or without dependent children, the relocation grant shall be paid at the  prevailing family rate. Where there are dependent children, the relocation grant  shall be paid to the parent of whom the children are recognized as being dependants  and who received dependency allowance;    (b)  When both staff members travel to the same duty station at different  intervals separated by a period of six months or longer, and without dependent  children, each staff member shall be eligible to opt for the relocation grant at the  single rate. If their travel is separated by less than six months, they shall receive the  combined relocation grant payment at the family rate;    (c)  When both staff members travel to the same duty station at different  times separated by a period of six months or longer, and with dependent children,  the parent of whom children are recognized as being dependants shall be eligible to  opt for the relocation grant at the family rate. The family rate shall be paid,  provided that at least one of the dependent children travels to the duty station at the  Organization's expense with payment of assignment grant. The parent of whom the  children are not recognized as dependants shall be eligible to opt for the relocation  grant at the single rate;        Travel to different duty stations       (d)  When both staff members travel to different duty stations, each staff  member may opt for the relocation grant at the single rate. If the staff members have  dependent children, the relocation grant shall be paid at the family rate to the parent  to whom the children are recognized as being dependants and receives dependency  allowance, provided at least one of the dependent children travels to the duty station  at the Organization's expense with payment of assignment grant.        On separation from service     17.6 Upon travel on separation from service from the same duty station, where both  spouses are staff members of the United Nations or another organization of the United  Nations common system, the option for relocation grant shall be applied as follows:    (a)  When both staff members separate within a period of less than six months  of each other, only one combined relocation grant shall be paid at the family rate;    (b)  When both staff members separate at different intervals separated by a  period of six months or longer, and without dependent children, both spouses may  each receive the relocation grant at the single rate;    (c)  When both staff members separate at different intervals separated by a  period of six months or longer, and where there are dependent children, the parent  to whom the children are recognized as being dependent shall receive the relocation  grant at the family rate, provided at least one of the dependent children travels on  separation at the Organization's expense. The parent to whom the children are not    ST/AI/2016/4    13/19  16-11297    recognized as dependants shall be eligible to opt for the relocation grant at the  single rate.   17.7 When both staff members separate from different duty stations, each staff  member may receive the applicable relocation grant. Where there are dependent  children, the staff member of whom the children are recognized as being dependants  may receive the relocation grant at the family rate, provided at least one dependent  child travels on separation at the Organization's expense.         Section 18      Recovery and adjustment of the relocation grant     18.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16.5 above, the relocation grant paid  in lieu of shipment of personal effects under sections 9.3 or 10.2 may be recovered  or adjusted under the following conditions:        Change of duty station       (a)  When a change of duty station takes place within one year of a staff  member's appointment or assignment, the relocation grant will not be recovered.  However, if the option for a relocation grant is selected upon the change of duty  station, the amount of the relocation grant payable on the change of duty station  shall be that proportion of the full grant that the completed months of service at the  preceding duty station bears to 12 months;        Return to the same duty station within 12 months       (b)  When a change of official duty station or a new appointment involves a  return to the same duty station at which the staff member was last stationed, and  where a relocation grant had been paid, the full amount of the relocation grant shall  be paid only when the staff member has been absent from that place for at least 12  months. If the option for a relocation grant is elected on return to the same duty  station, the amount payable shall be that proportion of the full relocation grant that  the completed months of absence bears to 12 months;        Resignation       (c)  In the event a staff member resigns before completing one year of service  at the duty station on appointment or assignment, the relocation grant paid in  connection with the appointment or assignment shall be prorated and recovered on  the basis that the number of months served bears to 12 months. No payment of  relocation grant on separation shall be made where there is no entitlement to return  travel, which results in the loss of an entitlement to unaccompanied shipment of  personal effects or relocation shipment provided under the provisions of the present  instructions.  18.2 No adjustment or recovery shall be made with respect to relocation grant  payments made for assignments or appointments of less than one year.   18.3 The Secretary-General may grant an exception to the provisions of sections  18.1 (a) and 18.1 (b) in cases where, for reasons attributable to the Organization,  such as abolishment of post, closure of a mission/office or organizational need, the  staff member does not complete at least one year of service at the duty station for  which the relocation grant was paid.   ST/AI/2016/4      16-11297  14/19       Part VI     Split shipments and the transportation of privately  owned automobiles           Section 19      Split shipments     19.1 Split shipments, within the meaning of the present instruction, are limited to  unaccompanied shipments, and refer to two consignments:     (a)  Originating from one location but destined to two locations;     (b)  Originating from two locations but destined to one location;    (c)  Originating from two locations and destined to two locations, as  authorized under section 19.3.  Relocation shipments under section 10.2 may not be split.  19.2 Shipments shall normally be made in one consignment. However,  unaccompanied shipments for appointments of one year or longer provided in the  present instruction may be split when the following conditions are met:    (a)  The staff member requests the shipment entitlement to be split into no  more than two shipments, which must be by surface means when this is the most  economical means of transport;    (b)  The combined weight or volume of the two shipments does not exceed  the total entitlement;    (c)  The request for split shipments relates to:    (i)  The entire entitlement to unaccompanied shipment; or    (ii) The remaining portion of the shipment entitlement after the staff member  has converted part of the surface entitlement to air freight under section 15.2 (c)  of the present instruction.  19.3 Split shipments may be authorized between the following places of departure  and destination:    (a)  On appointment, assignment or transfer, one of the shipments must be to  the initial or new duty station and may be from anywhere;    (b)  On appointment, the other shipment may be from the place of  recruitment to the place of home leave, or to the place where the staff member 's  spouse and/or dependent children reside;    (c)  On assignment or transfer, the other shipment may be from the previous  duty station to the new duty station, to the place of home leave or to the place where  the staff member's spouse and/or dependent children reside;    (d)  On separation, one of the shipments must be from the duty station, the  other may be from anywhere. One of the shipments must be to the place of  repatriation; the other may be to a location designated by the staff member, other  than within the duty station area.    ST/AI/2016/4    15/19  16-11297    19.4 Subject to the weight and volume maxima established in section 9.3 above, the  total cost of split shipments to be paid by the United Nations may not exceed the  cost of shipping separately the actual weights or volumes of the two consignments  between the single places of departure and destination.  19.5 Requests for split shipments shall normally be made before the staff member 's  departure or separation from service and not later than two months after arrival at  the initial or new duty station or departure from the last duty station in the case of  separation. However, where the assignment is for two years or more, the request for  split shipments may be made within six months of arrival at the duty station.        Section 20      Transportation of privately owned automobiles     20.1 Pursuant to section 9.4 (d) above, the cost of transporting a privately owned  automobile to a duty station may be partially reimbursed to a staff member holding  an appointment other than a temporary appointment on appointment, transfer or  assignment to a duty station designated for that purpose when the following  conditions are met:    (a)  The appointment or assignment is for a duration expected to be two years  or longer. If the initial appointment or assignment was for a lesser period, the  request may be made when the initial period is extended to two years or longer;    (b)  The staff member is expected to remain at the duty station for a period of  not less than 18 months following the date of arrival of the automobile at the port of  entry in the country of the duty station. Reimbursement may also be authorized for a  newly purchased automobile arriving at a later date if the staff member can show  that, at the time it was ordered, he or she was expected to remain at the duty station  for a period of not less than 18 months;    (c)  The duty station to which the automobile is transported is in a country or  territory listed in the information circular issued for that purpose by the Assistant  Secretary-General for Human Resources Management;    (d)  The staff member is not being provided with an automobile for both  official and private use;    (e)  Transportation is, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, reasonable in  the circumstances. In making such determination in the case of an automobile  previously in the possession of the staff member, account will be taken of such  factors as the age of the automobile, the potential loss on resale if not transported  and the relative price of automobiles in the locality and at the duty station.  20.2 Reimbursement shall not exceed 75 per cent of the total costs of transportation  (including freight, insurance and handling charges), subject to a maximum of  $1,875. In the case of a new automobile purchased at, and imported to, a duty  station in a country or territory listed in the information circular referred to in  section 20.1 (c) above, the demonstrable shipping costs charged by the dealer may  likewise be reimbursed, provided that the costs are reasonable in all the  circumstances (including place of shipment in relation to nearest source of supply).  20.3 Amounts reimbursed under the present section shall be recovered if the  automobile is sold or shipped to another location away from the staff member 's duty  station before the end of the appointment or assignment or within three years of its  ST/AI/2016/4      16-11297  16/19    arrival at the duty station, whichever is earlier, unless in the opinion of the  Secretary-General the sale or shipment away from the duty station is justified by a  need to replace the automobile, for example, as a result of wear and tear.  20.4 No reimbursement shall be made for the cost of transporting privately owned  automobiles upon separation from service.        Section 21      Shipping arrangements and claims       In making their shipping arrangements and claims under the present  instruction, and in submitting requests for conversion of surface entitlements to air  shipments, for split shipments, for transportation of privately owned automobiles or  for storage, staff members shall follow the procedures set out in the information  circular on excess baggage, shipments and insurance.         Part VII     Insurance           Section 22      Conditions of entitlement     22.1 A staff member's insurance entitlements shall be in accordance with the  provisions of the present instruction.  22.2 Where storage of personal effects and household goods has been authorized,  the Organization shall also pay the cost of insurance. Storage insurance related to  the shipment while in transit is not included in the insurance entitlement, except  when the Secretary-General determines that such storage is directly incidental to the  transportation of the consignment.  22.3 In the case of unaccompanied shipments under sections 8 and 9 and relocation  shipment provided in section 10, the staff member shall furnish the Organization,  prior to shipment, with an itemized inventory, through form PT.78, of all articles,  including containers such as suitcases, and the replacement value in United States  dollars of each article in the shipments.        Section 23      Maximum insurance entitlements     23.1 The maximum insurance entitlement for unaccompanied shipments of staff  holding a temporary appointment or staff holding fixed-term and continuing  appointments assigned for less than one year shall be $1,600.  23.2 The maximum insurance entitlement for unaccompanied shipments of staff  members holding an appointment other than a temporary appointment or assigned  for one year longer shall be:    (a)  $16,000 for the individual staff member;    (b)  $8,000 for the first eligible family member;    (c)  $4,800 for each additional eligible family member.    ST/AI/2016/4    17/19  16-11297    23.3 For relocation shipments under section 10.2, the maximum insurance coverage  shall be:    (a)  $80,000 for a staff member without a spouse or dependent child;    (b)  $130,000 for a staff member with a spouse or dependent child.  23.4 The maximum insurance entitlement defined in section 23.3 above shall also  apply to cover both the personal effects and household goods that may be stored  under section 10.4 above and the personal effects and household goods that may be  shipped under section 10.3.  23.5 The insurance coverage provided under sections 23.1, 23.2 and 23.3 above  shall not include articles of special value for which special premium rates are  charged. In such cases the cost above the normal premium for insuring standard  items is payable by the staff member even if he or she is within the overall  insurance entitlement.        Section 24      Additional insurance coverage requirement       Staff members who are subject to national income taxation in respect of their  United Nations salaries are required to have additional insurance coverage for the  difference between the full value and the coverage provided by the United Nations  under section 23 of the present instruction for their personal effects and household  goods while in transit or in storage.        Section 25      Insurance arrangements and claims     25.1 In making their insurance arrangements and claims under the present  instruction, staff members shall follow the procedures set out in the information  circular on excess baggage, shipments and insurance issued by the Assistant  Secretary-General for Central Support Services.  25.2 Claims are payable at the rate in effect at the time of settlement.

The purpose of this circular is to inform the staff of the procedures to be followed when submitting a claim or request under the provisions of administrative instruction ST/AI/1999/15, ""Excess baggage, shipments and insurance"" (""the instruction""), relating in particular to: (a) Claims for reimbursement of excess baggage charges, requests for a cash advance against an excess baggage entitlement, requests for conversion of excess baggage to unaccompanied shipment and for conversion of unaccompanied shipments to excess baggage, under part I of the instruction; (b) The manner in which staff members make their shipping arrangements and submit claims or requests for conversion of surface entitlements to air shipments, for split shipments, for transportation of privately owned automobiles or for storage, under part II of the instruction; and (c) The manner in which staff members make their insurance arrangements and submit claims, under part III of the instruction. 2. This circular also provides additional related information which staff members may find useful when exercising their entitlements under the provisions of the instruction. ST/IC/1999/99 2 I. Excess baggage Reimbursement of excess baggage charges and cash advance against the excess baggage entitlement 3. For reimbursement of excess baggage charges, the staff member completes an F.10 claim form (voucher for reimbursement of expenses) and, in addition to the other documents required by the form, attaches the receipts from the carrier for excess baggage payments. The completed F.10 form and attached documentation are submitted to the executive or local personnel office. 4. If the staff member needs a cash advance against his/her excess baggage entitlement, a request to that effect is submitted to the executive or local personnel office which will determine the anticipated cost within the authorized limit and indicate the amount of the advance on the travel authorization. The staff member accounts for the use of the advance no later than two weeks after completion of the journey, by attaching the receipts from the carrier for excess baggage costs to the F.10 claim form. Conversion of excess baggage to unaccompanied shipment 5. When the baggage allowance is calculated by the airline on the basis of weight, a staff member who wishes to convert the excess baggage entitlement to an equivalent weight in unaccompanied shipment submits a written request to the executive or local personnel office in advance of the travel. The approval of the request is indicated in the travel authorization, which will specify the kilos of excess baggage authorized for conversion to unaccompanied shipment and state that no cash advance or reimbursement is to be allowed for that amount of excess baggage entitlement. Conversion of unaccompanied shipment entitlement to excess baggage 6. Staff members who wish to convert their unaccompanied shipment entitlement on home leave, family visit or education grant travel to excess baggage make a written request to the executive or local personnel office in advance of the travel. Approval of the request is indicated in the travel authorization. II. Shipments General shipping arrangements 7. Shipments of personal effects and household goods are arranged in accordance with the procedures established by the United Nations office that authorizes the shipment. Staff members should NOT make arrangements for the shipment of their personal effects and household goods until they receive the necessary prior authorization and related instructions from the Organization. Such authorization is normally given in a travel authorization, which indicates the staff member's entitlements. 8. Shipments of staff members' personal effects and household goods are usually arranged by one of the United Nations offices listed in paragraph 21 below or through ST/IC/1999/99 3 another United Nations or UNDP office, whenever practical, or through a moving company arranged by United Nations Headquarters. Where the staff member is entitled to removal costs under rule 107.27 and the Organization has no arrangement with a particular firm to undertake removal shipments, the staff member may be required to take three bids from local companies of his or her choice to serve as a basis for a decision by the Organization as to which company should be requested to arrange the shipment. 9. Exceptionally, staff members may also, at their request, be authorized to obtain three bids for door-to-door services when they do not wish to use the firm indicated by the United Nations and are prepared to prepay all costs and claim reimbursement through the office which issued the travel authorization. Staff members authorized to use this exceptional procedure are reminded that they may not be reimbursed for amounts in excess of the amount payable by the United Nations for the same weight or volume, within the entitlement, to the packing, moving and shipping companies that generally service the United Nations office where arrangements are being made. All bids should be requested after the staff member has decided which household goods he or she wishes to ship. The United Nations is not responsible for the performance of services by the company selected by the staff member. 10. Staff members are advised NOT to include items such as jewellery, currency or coins in shipments. Insurance companies generally charge higher premiums on articles of special or unusual value, as well as on antiques, jewellery, furs, coin and stamp collections, irrespective of their value. In such cases, any cost above the normal premium for insuring standard items is to be borne by the staff member. Estimates and packing 11. Packing companies usually send an estimator to look at the goods being shipped so as to provide an estimate of their weight and volume and decide what kind and what amount of packing material will be necessary. The estimate is not binding on the company or the Organization but serves as a guide to the company regarding the packing requirements and to the staff member regarding the amount of goods that may be shipped within his or her entitlement, as well as the personal costs that may be incurred if it appears that the entitlement may be exceeded. The staff member should arrange to obtain the estimate after deciding which household goods are to be shipped and should request a signed copy of the estimate. The staff member should make sure that the estimate is in weight and volume in both gross and net terms. 12. The staff member or his or her representative should be present during packing to make certain that all the goods are packed. The workmen from the packing company will normally make up a packing list and note the condition of the goods on this list, usually in an abbreviated form. For example, if a piece of furniture is ""marred"" or ""gouged"", the workman may enter ""M"" or ""G"" on the packing list. The staff member should be aware of the meaning of all abbreviations and make certain that the condition of the goods is described accurately. A statement to this effect should be written on the packing list before it is signed, and a copy of the signed packing list should be retained by the staff member. Forwarding arrangements 13. If the staff member is proceeding to a new duty station, the shipment should be sent care of the United Nations office there, unless the United Nations advises the staff member ST/IC/1999/99 4 otherwise. Shipments to New York should be addressed to the staff member c/o United Nations Transportation Operations Section (room S-2012), New York, NY 10017, USA. 14. If the shipment is not consigned to a United Nations office (e.g., upon separation) and the United Nations has not made arrangements with an agent at the destination to provide necessary services with regard to customs clearance and delivery from the seaport or airport to the residence or a commercial warehouse, the agent's invoice for these services should be paid by the staff member after careful review of the required supporting documents, including rated airway bills or bills of lading and weigh master certificates. The delivery receipt, signed by the staff member or his or her authorized representative, the agent's receipted invoice, and all supporting documents should be submitted, together with an F.10 claim form, for reimbursement of expenses. Approved costs within the limits of the entitlement are reimbursed to the staff member after deduction of any amounts that may be due to the Organization from the staff member for excess shipping, insurance or other related costs. Arrangements at destination 15. Staff members should acquaint themselves with import procedures, as well as with possible customs restrictions or limitations at the destination, through the embassy or consular office concerned in the country of departure. Import procedures may require presentation of an inventory certified by a consular officer or may involve presentation of evidence regarding the staff member's previous country of residence. Copies of invoices may also be required for any recent purchases. 16. It is important for the staff member to be present when the shipment arrives at the destination in order to attend to customs clearance formalities and arrange for delivery to the residence. This factor should be taken into account in making the shipping arrangements, even though the scheduling of the shipments may be difficult and unpredictable. If the staff member is not present at the destination, the shipment may be retained pending clearance, and demurrage charges payable by the staff member may be incurred. 17. Upon delivery to the residence, the staff member or the person duly authorized by him or her to receive the shipment should check the shipping documents to note whether any cases are missing and should examine the packing cases carefully for any external damage such as water marks, dents or holes. If damage or loss is noted or even suspected, the recipient should make a notation on the receipt, which should not be signed until the required notation of actual or suspected loss or damage has been made. A copy of the receipt should be retained, since it is an essential supporting document for any claim that may arise. Transportation of privately owned automobiles 18. Under staff rules 107.27 (d) (iv) and 207.20 (l) and section 12 of administrative instruction ST/AI/1999/15, ""Excess baggage, shipments and insurance"", one of the conditions for the partial reimbursement of the cost of transportation of privately owned automobiles is that the duty station to which the automobile is being transported be in a country or territory designated as one to which the United Nations may accept responsibility for such cost. The list of these countries and territories is communicated ST/IC/1999/99 5 to the staff by the information circular on transportation of privately owned automobiles issued by the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management. III. Insurance 19. Insurance arrangements may be made by the Organization or by the staff member. Insurance arrangements made by the Organization 20. If the staff member elects to have the United Nations arrange for insurance against all risks of physical loss or damage from any external cause on unaccompanied shipments authorized to be shipped and insured at United Nations expense, he or she must provide, prior to shipment, an itemized inventory of all articles in the shipment, including containers such as suitcases, and the replacement value in United States dollars of each article in the shipment. Form PT.78, entitled ""Itemized valued inventory of household goods and personal effects"", should be used for this purpose. All articles of special value, such as antiques, jewellery, furs, and coin and stamp collections, should be listed separately (see para. 10 above). If the staff member has more than one shipment, an itemized valued inventory for each must be prepared separately. 21. Requests for insurance arrangements by the United Nations, and the itemized valued inventory are to be submitted to the office indicated below: (a) New York: Transportation Operations Section, Travel and Transportation Service, OCSS, for shipments: (i) To New York from all places, except Vienna; (ii) From New York to all places, except Geneva and Vienna; (iii) To or from any other place, except Geneva and Vienna. (b) Geneva: Transportation, Travel and Housing Unit, UNOG, for shipments: (i) To Geneva from all places; (ii) From Geneva to all places, except New York. (c) Vienna: Travel and Transportation Unit, General Support Section, UNOV, for shipments: (i) To Vienna from all places, except Geneva; (ii) From Vienna to all places, except Geneva; (iii) To or from any other place, except Geneva, for staff administered by UNOV. Insurance company liability 22. Staff members are reminded that, if they do not request insurance for the total value shown on the inventory, the insurance company's liability is reduced and any resulting insurance claim will be settled on a reduced pro rata basis. For example, if an unaccompanied shipment valued at $50,000 is insured for only $25,000, the staff member will not receive more than 50 per cent of the value listed in the inventory for any goods lost or damaged. ST/IC/1999/99 6 Information on premium and insurance company's representative at destination 23. Information on the premium chargeable under the United Nations insurance policy is available upon request from the office that is responsible for arranging the insurance of the shipment. Normally, the staff member receives a notice from the United Nations indicating the amount of extra premium costs payable some time after delivery of the shipment. However, in cases such as separation from service or extension of insurance (see para. 26 below), prepayment is required. 24. Staff members should request from the United Nations office that arranged the insurance the name and address of the representative of the insurance company agent at destination. Insurance arrangements made by staff member 25. A staff member may arrange his or her own insurance and claim reimbursement for the premium paid, within the limits specified in section 16 of administrative instruction ST/AI/1999/15, ""Excess baggage, shipments and insurance"". In those cases, the staff member must submit an itemized valued inventory with a reimbursement claim supported by a receipted invoice showing the rate and amount of premium paid. The maximum amount of premium reimbursable cannot exceed the premium payable by the United Nations under its worldwide policy for equivalent coverage of the items listed on the inventory, within the limits of the entitlement. Insurance of goods in storage before shipment 26. If goods are stored at a commercial warehouse prior to shipment without being insured while in storage, an insurance company will not normally insure them afterwards unless they are unpacked and examined for possible loss or damage before being shipped. Since unpacking and inspection at that stage would be impractical and also costly to the staff member, it is advisable for staff members who find it necessary to store their goods at a commercial warehouse prior to shipment to request the United Nations to obtain insurance coverage for the period that the goods are to remain in storage. Such coverage would be obtained at the staff member's own expense unless an entitlement to goods in storage exists under staff rule 107.21 (e) or 207.20 (f). 27. If a staff member has insured goods in storage with an insurance company other than the company which the United Nations uses, the staff member is advised to arrange in-transit insurance coverage with the same company to ensure continuity and follow the procedures outlined in paragraph 25 above to claim reimbursement within the limits of the entitlement. Extension of insurance to cover goods placed in storage after shipment 28. Insurance coverage obtained by the United Nations for goods in transit ends upon arrival at the destination (i.e., the staff member's residence or a storage warehouse). If ST/IC/1999/99 7 staff members are unable to take possession of their belongings upon arrival at seaport/airport and the goods are to be stored, the staff members should request an extension of insurance at their own expense from the company that insured the shipment. In this way, the belongings would be protected in the event of an insurance claim. For shipments insured by the United Nations, staff members should request an extension of insurance from the appropriate office mentioned in paragraph 21 above and enclose the insurance premium payment for the expected duration of the storage. Insurance ceases automatically upon expiration of the period for which a premium to have the belongings insured has been paid. If a staff member does not provide the necessary information and prepay the premium, the United Nations will not arrange for extension of insurance, and the insurance coverage will lapse. Information on the premium chargeable for extension of insurance is available from the office that arranged the insurance. Insurance claims 29. Insofar as possible, staff members should arrange to have their belongings unpacked and examined immediately upon delivery. If damage or loss is noted or even suspected, the staff member should immediately file a claim against all carriers that handled the shipment. In the case of an air shipment, the claim against the airline for loss or damage should be filed within seven days from the date of release of the goods by the airline. 30. If a sea shipment is to be delivered to a storage warehouse and is to remain in storage for one year or longer before it is delivered to the staff member's residence, the staff member or his/her representative should file a preliminary claim for possible damage against the steamship company at the time the shipment is released by the steamship company. In addition, before the end of one year, the staff member or his/her representative, should make a written request to the steamship company for an ""extension of suit time"", since the normal period of suit time is limited to one year. Any further extension should similarly be requested from the steamship company. These preliminary steps are required to preserve the right to file a subsequent detailed claim if damage or loss is noted when the shipment is finally delivered to the residence. 31. In the event that a carrier appears to have lost part of a shipment, the staff member should, in the written claim against the carrier, request that a ""short-landing"" certificate be issued. If it appears that a whole shipment has been lost, a ""non-delivery"" certificate should be requested in writing if an arrival notification is not received from the carrier within 14 days from the shipment's expected arrival. 32. If the shipment was insured through the United Nations, either in New York, Geneva or Vienna, the staff member should follow the instructions received from the corresponding office regarding claim procedures. 33. If the staff member's shipment was not insured through the United Nations, the staff member should contact the insurance company that insured the shipment. Settlement of claims 34. Irrespective of whether or not insurance has been arranged through the United Nations, it is the staff member's personal responsibility to make sure that all documents required for an insurance claim are obtained and submitted to the insurance company. Failure to follow the procedures described in paragraphs 28, 29, 30 and the instructions ST/IC/1999/99 8 referred to in paragraph 31 in a timely manner may render a claim unacceptable. Inquiries regarding the status of a claim should be addressed by the staff member directly to the insurance company or its local agent. However, in cases where the insurance has been arranged by the United Nations and settlements appear to have been unduly delayed or other difficulties are experienced with the insurance company, the United Nations will render assistance to the staff member upon request. 35. Claims are payable at the rate of exchange in effect at the time of settlement. Payments in connection with an insurance claim may be received from the carrier or the insurance company. In all cases where payments are received from a carrier, the insurance company must be notified through the United Nations office or the insurance company's agent that processed the claim, so that the amount of the insurance settlement may be adjusted to reflect the payment received and avoid duplication. If duplicate payments are received, reimbursement must be made to the insurance company. "

The Secretary-General has received from the Permanent Mission of the United States of America to the United Nations a note verbale dated 24 February 2004 in which it informs the Secretariat of the new procedures for the filing of petitions for special immigrant classification and/or applications for lawful permanent resident status in the United States. 2. The text of the note verbale is set out in the annex to the present circular. Attached to the note verbale is the text of section 101 (a) (27) (I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and notices on the subject published in the United States Federal Register (see appendices I and II). * The present circular will be in effect until further notice. 2 ST/IC/2004/14 Annex Note verbale dated 24 February 2004 from the Permanent Mission of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General The Permanent Mission of the United States of America to the United Nations wishes to inform the Secretariat that the Department of Homeland Security, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service, has advised the Department of State that as from 23 February 2004 it will designate the Nebraska Service Center as the sole filing location for petitions for special immigrant classification and/or applications for lawful permanent resident status as defined by section 101 (a) (27) (I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act). USCIS is establishing one filing location in order to improve service to eligible officers and employees of international organizations and their family members. Notices on this subject were published in the Federal Register on 23 January 2004 (vol. 69, No. 15, pp. 3380-3381) and corrections were published on 28 January (ibid., No. 18, p. 4210). Under section 101 (a) (27) (I) of the Act, USCIS allows certain officers and employees of international organizations and their eligible family members to petition for special immigrant classification and apply for lawful permanent resident status in the United States, provided they have maintained G-4 or N non-immigrant status and meet certain residency and physical presence requirements as specified in the statute. Petitions and/or applications for the benefit should be submitted to the Nebraska Service Center. Applicants requesting classification under section 101 (a) (27) (I) should file form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant, with all supporting documentation and fees, to the following address: Nebraska Service Center P.

Applicants should include a copy of the form I-360 Approval Notice (form I-797). 3 ST/IC/2004/14 Applicants are to be reminded that in certain situations it may be beneficial to file form I-360 and form I-485 concurrently. As noted in the statute, eligible unmarried sons and daughters with the requisite residence and physical presence in G-4 or N non-immigrant status must file form I-485 no later than their twenty-fifth birthday.

(I) (i) an immigrant who is the unmarried son or daughter of an officer or employee, or of a former officer or employee, of an international organization described in paragraph (15)(G)(i), and who (I) while maintaining the status of a nonimmigrant under paragraph (15)(G)(iv) or paragraph (15)(N), has resided and been physically present in the United States for periods totalling at least one-half of the seven years before the date of application for a visa or for adjustment of status to a status under this subparagraph and for a period or periods aggregating at least seven years between the ages of five and 21 years, and (II) applies for a visa or adjustment of status under this subparagraph no later than his twenty-fifth birthday or six months after the date of the enactment of the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988, whichever is later; (ii) an immigrant who is the surviving spouse of a deceased officer or employee of such an international organization, and who (I) while maintaining the status of a non-immigrant under paragraph (15)(G)(iv) or paragraph (15)(N), has resided and been physically present in the United States for periods totalling at least one-half of the seven years before the date of application for a visa or for adjustment of status to a status under this subparagraph and for a period or periods aggregating at least 15 years before the date of the death of such officer or employee, and (II) files a petition for status under this subparagraph no later than six months after the date of such death or six months after the date of the enactment of the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988, whichever is later; (iii) an immigrant who is a retired officer or employee of such an international organization, and who (I) while maintaining the status of a non-immigrant under paragraph (15)(G)(iv), has resided and been physically present in the United States for periods totalling at least one-half of the seven years before the date of application for a visa or for adjustment of status to a status under this subparagraph and for a period or periods aggregating at least 15 years before the date of the officer or employee's retirement from any such international organization, and (II) files a petition for status under this subparagraph no later than six months after the date of such retirement or six months after the date of enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994, whichever is later; or (iv) an immigrant who is the spouse of a retired officer or employee accorded the status of special immigrant under clause (iii), accompanying or following to join such retired officer or employee as a member of his immediate family. 6 ST/IC/2004/14 Appendix II Notices on the Immigration and Nationality Act of the United States of America published in the Federal Register 3380 Federal Register/Vol. 69, No. 15/Friday, January 23, 2004/Notices DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services [CIS No. 2304-03] Direct Mail of Requests for Special Immigrant Classification and/or Adjustment of Status by Officers or Employees of International Organizations and Their Family Members AGENCY: Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Department of Homeland Security. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice advises eligible members of the international organization community that the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) is adjusting and expanding its Direct Mail Program by directing that all petitions for special immigrant classification pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), whether submitted separately, or concurrently with an application for adjustment of status, be mailed to the Nebraska Service Center. Applicants who apply for adjustment of status based on a previously approved petition for special immigrant classification pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act must file their adjustment application at the Nebraska Service Center. We are making this change to provide better customer service. DATES: This notice is effective February 2, 2004. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Corinna Luna-Benavides, Service Center Operations, Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Department of Homeland Security, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20314, telephone (202) 305- 8010. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background What Is the Direct Mail Program? Under the Direct Mail Program, individuals seeking certain immigration benefits, including classification as a special immigrant pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act, have been directed to mail the prescribed application or petition directly to a service center for processing instead of submitting it to a local office. See 61 FR 56060 (October 30, 1996). This centralized procedure has resulted in more efficient processing of applications through standardization, the elimination of duplicative work, and the increase in staff productivity. What Authority Does CIS Have To Administer the Direct Mail Program? On March 1, 2003, the functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) were transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107- 296. The responsibility for the immigration-benefits- adjudications function of the Service, which includes the processes for the filing of petitions and applications, was transferred to CIS of the DHS. Explanation of Changes What Does This Notice Do? This Notice advises eligible members of the international organization community that, as of February 23, 2004, if they wish to file a petition for classification as a special immigrant pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act on Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant, the Form I- 360 must be mailed to the Nebraska Service Center. If the petitioner wishes to file an application for adjustment of status on Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, concurrently with the Form I-360, the Form I-485 must be mailed simultaneously (filed at the same time, bundled together in a single mailer or delivery packet, with proper filing fees, to the Nebraska Service Center). Applicants who file Form I-485 for adjustment of status based on a previously approved petition for classification as a special immigrant pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act, must now file their application for adjustment of status only at the Nebraska Service Center. Does This Notice Make Any Changes Relating to an Alien's Eligibility for Classification as a Special Immigrant and/or Adjustment of Status? No. This notice only alters the filing location for petitions and applications for adjustment of status, filed either concurrently or separately under the Direct Mail Program, submitted by international organizations' officers or employees and their family members seeking special immigrant classification pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act. 7 ST/IC/2004/14 How Are These Petitions and Applications Currently Being Processed? Currently, if an eligible alien were filing only a Form I-360 petition for classification as a special immigrant pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Federal Register/Vol. 69, No. 15/Friday, January 23, 2004/Notices 3381 Act, he or she would file the petition at the service center having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. If an eligible alien were petitioning for special immigrant classification and applying for adjustment of status concurrently, then he or she would apply for both actions at his or her local district office. If an alien were applying for adjustment of status after his or her Form I-360 petition for classification as a special immigrant had been approved, then that alien would file a Form I-485 adjustment application at his or her local district office. Why Is CIS Changing the Application Filing Location at This Time? The CIS is consolidating the adjudication of these benefits at one location to enhance the uniformity of decisions and improve customer service. Are There Any Advantages for an Alien Eligible for Classification as a Special Immigrant Pursuant to Section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act To Concurrently File an Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485) With His or Her Petition for Special Immigrant Classification (Form I-360)? For certain eligible aliens, it may be in their best interest to file concurrently because of statutory deadlines requiring them to file for adjustment of status by a certain date. Why Would an Alien Eligible Under Section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act Not Want To File an Application for Adjustment Concurrently With a Petition for Special Immigrant Classification? There may be certain situations whereby aliens might wish to continue to maintain their current immigration status, while knowing that they have already qualified for special immigrant status. In addition, an eligible alien may be currently outside the United States and wish to file the petition for special immigrant classification with CIS, before applying for an immigrant visa abroad, rather than applying to adjust status in the United States. How Will Eligible Applicants Be Notified of This Change in Filing Location? In addition to this notice, CIS will be alerting those eligible aliens of the new filing procedures on its forms Web site, at http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/ formsfee/index.htm. To ensure that all international organizations are aware of this change, the Department of State will be contacting these organizations to inform them of the new filing procedure When Will the New Procedure Become Effective? This procedure becomes effective on February 23, 2004. What Address Should Be Used? If an alien is only submitting a petition for classification as a special immigrant (Form I-360) pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act, then the following address should be used: Nebraska Service Center, P.O. Box 87360, Lincoln, NE 68501-7360. If an alien is concurrently submitting an application for adjustment of status (Form I- 485) with a petition for classification as a special immigrant (Form I-360) pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act, or if an alien who has already had the Form I-360 approved by CIS pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act and later separately submits an application for adjustment of status (Form I-485), then the following address should be used: Nebraska Service Center, P.O. Box 87485, Lincoln, NE 68501-7485. What Will Happen to the Petitions/ Applications Already Filed? Petitions for classification as a special immigrant pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act and any applications for adjustment of status based upon such special immigrant classification that have been filed with CIS prior to February 23, 2004, will be adjudicated to their completion at the service center or district office where they were originally filed. What Will Happen to Those Applications/Petitions Filed at a Service Center or District Office After February 23, 2004? Petitions for classification as a special immigrant pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act and any applications for adjustment of status based upon such special immigrant classification that are filed with CIS at a location other 8 ST/IC/2004/14 than the Nebraska Service Center after February 23, 2004, will be forwarded to the Nebraska Service Center until the instructions to the Forms I-360 and I-485 have been amended to include the correct filing address. Will Aliens Applying for Adjustment of Status Be Interviewed? Applicants may be eligible for a waiver of the interview pursuant to existing CIS interview waiver criteria. If the interview requirement is not waived, the case at the Nebraska Service Center will be referred to the district office where the applicant lives for an interview. Which Applicants Will This Notice Affect? This notice will affect those eligible individuals who have not yet submitted their petitions for special immigrant classification pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act and/or filed for adjustment of status based upon classification as a special immigrant pursuant to section 101(a)(27)(I) of the Act.

Since 2009, the United Nations has been informed that the Department of State  does not issue a G-4 visa for opposite-sex domestic partners.  4.  The diplomatic note informs the United Nations that the Department of State  will not issue a G-4 visa for same-sex domestic partners. As of 1 October 2018, same- sex domestic partners accompanying or seeking to join newly arrived United Nations  officials must provide proof of marriage to be eligible for a G-4 visa or to seek a  change into such status.  5.  Currently accredited same-sex domestic partners of United Nations officials  who wish to maintain their G-4 visa must be ready to submit proof of marriage by  31 December 2018. After 31 December 2018, they will be expected to leave the  United States within 30 days unless they submit the required proof of marriage or  have obtained separate authorization to remain in the country through a change of  non-immigrant status.  6.  In addition, on or after 1 October 2018, all same-sex domestic partners applying  for visa renewal in the United States must be married to qualify for a G-4 visa.  7.  All United Nations officials are informed that, when notifying the United States  Mission to the United Nations of new spouses for accreditation, the United Nations  is requested to submit appropriate documentation that the couple is married.  __________________    * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.    1  The previous diplomatic notes referred to in the text of the diplomatic note are set out in annexes  II and III of the present circular.  ST/IC/2018/25      18-15302  2/6    Moreover, to be eligible for a G-4 visa, the spouse of a United Nations official must  not be a member of some other household and must reside regularly in the household  of the principal.  8.  Staff members should contact their human resources partner if they have any  questions about the present information circular or the content of the diplomatic note.        ST/IC/2018/25    3/6  18-15302    Annex I       Diplomatic note dated 12 July 2018 from the United States Mission  to the United Nations addressed to the United Nations Secretariat  and to the funds and programmes        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and to the Funds and Programs and has the honor to refer  to circular diplomatic notes numbers HC-144-(S)-09 of November 24, 2009 and HC- 60-02 of November 13, 2002 concerning the definition of family members.    As recalled in the referenced notes, it has long been an accepted principle of  international law that the privileges and immunities to which members of the  diplomatic community are entitled extend, to a certain degree, to the members of their  families forming part of their households. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic  Relations (Article 37(1)) specifies the privileges and immunities which shall be  accorded such ""members of the family of a diplomatic agent forming part of [the]  household"" but does not provide a definition of the term ""members of the family"" for  purposes of the Convention. The drafters of the Convention recognized that the  concept of ""family"" differs among the societies of the world and left the matter to be  resolved according to the standards of the respective receiving States.    Since the issuance of circular diplomatic note HC-144-(S)-09, the Supreme Court  of the United States has ruled that U.S. domestic laws banning recognition of same-sex  marriage are unlawful under the United States Constitution. Same-sex spouses of U.S.  diplomats now enjoy the same rights and benefits of opposite-sex spouses.    Consequently, the United Nations is informed that, consistent with changes to  Department of State policy, the Department will only be able to accept the  accreditation and registration of spouses of newly arrived officials, both same-sex and  opposite-sex, as members of the family of United Nations officials as of October 1,  2018. Further, consistent with internal Department of State policy changes, partners  accompanying United Nations officials or seeking to join the same must be married  in order to be eligible for the derivative G-4 nonimmigrant visa or to seek a change  into such status beginning October 1, 2018.     For all currently accredited same-sex domestic partners of United Nations officials  who wish to maintain their acceptance of accreditation and derivative G-4 nonimmigrant  visa status, the United Nations is requested to submit appropriate documentation to the  United States Mission to the United Nations, no later than December 31, 2018, that the  couple has legally married. After December 31, 2018, unless such individuals are able to  obtain separate authorization to remain in the United States through a change of  nonimmigrant status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  (USCIS), they will generally be expected to depart the country within thirty days.  However, on or after October 1, 2018, partners applying for a visa renewal in the United  States must be married in order to qualify for a G-4 nonimmigrant visa.     The requirements for eligibility of acceptance of accreditation as a spouse are  the same for all spousal relationships and include the following: a spouse must not be  a member of some other household and must reside regularly in the household of the  principal. Same-sex spouses of officials of the United Nations will be treated the same  as opposite-sex spouses when applying for a G-4 visa and for other immigration  purposes. When notifying the United States Mission to the United Nations of new  spouses of United Nations officials for accreditation, the United Nations is requested  to submit appropriate documentation that the couple is married.    The United States Mission to the United Nations avails itself of this opportunity  to renew to the United Nations Secretariat the assurances of its highest consideration.  ST/IC/2018/25      18-15302  4/6    Annex II       Diplomatic note dated 24 November 2009 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations addressed to the United Nations  Secretariat and to the funds and programmes        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and to the Funds and Programs and has the honor to refer  to circular diplomatic note number HC-60-02 (attached) of November 13, 2002  concerning the definition of family members.     As indicated in the referenced note, it has long been an accepted principle of  international law that the privileges and immunities to which members of the  diplomatic community are entitled extend, to a certain degree, to the members of their  families forming part of their households. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic  Relations (Article 37(1)) specifies the privileges and immunities which shall be  accorded such ""members of the family of a diplomatic agent forming part of [the]  household"" but does not provide a definition of the term ""members of the family"" for  the purposes of the Convention. The drafters of the Convention recognized that the  concept of ""family"" differs among the societies of the world and left the matter to be  resolved according to the standards of the respective receiving States.     The United Nations is informed that, in addition to the categories of individuals  previously accepted as family members, the United States Department of State has  determined that the definition of ""family"" forming part of the household of a member  of the diplomatic community may include same-sex domestic partners (""domestic  partners"") for the purposes of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and  the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in the United States. In accordance with  guidance from the White House, the Department of State is not in a position to accept  the accreditation and registration of opposite-sex domestic partners as members of  the family.    In order to be eligible for acceptance as a domestic partner of an official of the  United Nations, a domestic partner must not be a member of some other household,  must reside regularly in the household of the principal, and must be recognized by the  United Nations as a family member forming part of the household of the principal, as  demonstrated by eligibility for United Nations rights and benefits. Therefore, when  notifying the United States Mission of domestic partners of its officials, the United  Nations is requested to submit appropriate documentation that it recognizes the  domestic partner relationship, which could include evidence that it provided the  domestic partner with documentation to that effect, or with travel or other allowances.  Domestic partners of officials of the United Nations accepted by the United States  Mission or the Department of State should be eligible for G-4 visas.    In addition, the Department of State intends to pursue the legal measures  necessary to enable the United States to offer dependent employment to domestic  partners of United Nations officials in the context of the dependent employment  arrangement currently in place. The United Nations Secretariat will be advised of any  such developments as soon as it is possible to do so.    The attention of the United Nations Secretariat is also drawn to the applicable  provisions of international law in respect of the termination of status. Whenever any  person who has been accorded status as a member of the family in the United States  (other than a student attending boarding school or college) ceases to reside with the  principal, such person immediately ceases to be a member of the family. Accordingly,  all privileges and immunities, if any, to which such person previously had been    ST/IC/2018/25    5/6  18-15302    entitled in the United States would terminate thirty days thereafter unless in a  particular case a shorter time has been specified by the United States Mission.    The United Nations Secretariat is advised that until the Department of State  publications are revised to incorporate ""domestic partners"" as members of the family  of a member of the United Nations diplomatic community forming part of the  household, references to family members in the context of privileges and immunities  and related matters should be understood to include domestic partners as described  herein. It is emphasized that the standard set forth in this note is to define members  of the family for officials of the United Nations and is without prejudice to other  definitions of family for other purposes which have an independent basis in  international agreements or United States domestic law.    The United States Mission to the United Nations avails itself of this opportunity  to renew to the United Nations Secretariat and the Funds and Programs the assurances  of its highest consideration.      ST/IC/2018/25      18-15302  6/6    Annex III       Diplomatic note dated 13 November 2002 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations addressed to the permanent  missions to the United Nations        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  Permanent Missions to the United Nations and has the honor to advise them of the  definition which applies to the term ""family"" as that term is used for the purpose of  extension of diplomatic privileges and immunities by the host country. This circular  note replaces the United States Mission's note of March 16, 1987 on the same subject.    For the purposes of the application in the United States of paragraph 37 of the  Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, operative for Permanent Missions to the  United Nations through Section 15 of the Headquarters Agreement between the  United States and the United Nations, ""family...forming part of...household"" means  the spouse of the member of the Mission and his or her unmarried children under 21  years of age, who are not members of some other household, and who reside  exclusively in the Mission member's household. Additionally, the term ""family""  includes the Mission member's children under 23 years of age, provided that such  children are attending an institution of higher learning on a full-time basis.    Other persons who are not members of some other household, who reside  exclusively in the Mission member's household, and who are recognized by the  sending state as members of the family forming part of that household, may be  considered ""family"" for the purposes of the Vienna Convention under very  exceptional circumstances and with the expressed approval of the United States  Government. In such cases, a formal request for consideration by the United States  Department of State must be submitted to the United States Mission. The request must  include full justification for the requested exception.    The attention of the Permanent Missions is also drawn to the applicable  provisions of international law in respect of termination status of family members.  Whenever any person who has been accorded ""family"" status for the purposes of  diplomatic privileges and immunities in the United States ceases to reside with the  principal Mission member, marries, or otherwise ceases to be part of the Mission  member's household, such person immediately ceases to be a member of the ""family""  within the meaning of international law and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic  Relations. Accordingly, all privileges and immunities to which such person had been  entitled in the United States would terminate.    It is emphasized that the standard set forth in this note is solely to define  members of the family pursuant to the terms of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic  Relations with regard to the extension of diplomatic privileges and immunities. It is  without prejudice to other definitions of family for other purposes such as the  continued eligibility for ""G"" visa status, which have an independent basis in  international agreements or United States domestic law.    The United States Mission to the United Nations avails itself of this opportunity  to renew to the Permanent Missions to the United Nations the assurances of its highest  consideration.    "

Accrual of service credits towards home leave    3.2 The home leave entitlement shall be administered in accordance with a points  system whereby service credit points accumulated towards home leave are used to  determine when a staff member's home leave falls due. Home leave service credit  points shall accrue on the basis of full calendar months of qualifying service.  3.3 Staff members who are eligible for home leave as of their date of appointment  shall accrue service credit points towards home leave from that date. Staff members  who become eligible for home leave subsequent to their appointment shall start to  accrue service credit points towards home leave from the effective date on which  they became eligible.  3.4 Staff members shall accrue service credit points towards home leave as follows:    (a)  A staff member assigned to a duty station with a 24-month cycle shall  earn one point for each full month of service at that duty station (i.e. 24 points in a  2-year period of service);  ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1      16-11041  4/12      (b)  A staff member assigned to a duty station with a 12-month cycle shall  earn two points for each full month of service at that duty station (i.e. 24 points in a  1-year period of service);    (c)  Fractions of a month of service shall be treated as follows:      (i)  From 1 to 15 days of service: no credit;      (ii) More than 15 days of service: full credit.  3.5 Part-time staff members eligible for home leave shall accrue service credit  points towards home leave with the same periodicity as full-time staff in accordance  with ST/AI/291/Rev.1, entitled ""Part-time employment"", or as amended. The  entitlement will be paid at the appropriate part-time rate.  3.6 Staff members shall not accrue service credit points towards home leave during  periods of special leave with partial pay or without pay exceeding one month. 2   3.7  When a staff member moves from a duty station with a normal 24-month home  leave cycle to a duty station with an accelerated 12-month home leave cycle, or when  the home leave cycle of a duty station changes from 24 months to 12 months, service  credit points shall accrue at the rate of two points per month of service as from the  effective date of transfer or assignment to the new duty station or as from the effective  date of change of the home leave cycle at the duty station. Similarly, in the reverse  situation when a staff member moves from a duty station with a 12-month home leave  cycle to a duty station with a 24-month home leave cycle, or when the home leave  cycle of a duty station changes from 12 months to 24 months, service credit points  shall accrue at the rate of one point per month of service as from the effective date of  transfer or assignment to the new duty station or the effective date of change of the  home leave cycle of the duty station. If the effective date of transfer, assignment or  change of home leave cycle of the duty station falls in between the first and the last  day of the month, the full credit for the month of service shall be based on the duty  station in which the staff member served for more than 15 days, as follows:    (a)  More than 15 days of service at the duty station with a normal 24-month  home leave cycle: one point for such month;    (b)  More than 15 days of service at the duty station with an accelerated  12-month home leave cycle: two points for such month.        Utilization of service credit points towards home leave travel    3.8 A staff member may exercise his or her home leave entitlement once he or she  has accrued 24 service credit points. Upon departure on home leave travel, 24 points  will be deducted from the staff member's balance of points, and the accrual of  points shall continue in accordance with the provisions of sections 3.2 to 3.7.        Advance and delayed home leave    3.9  A staff member may request to exercise home leave in advance of accruing the  24 service credit points required for the home leave entitlement. A staff member may  be granted advance home leave, provided that normally no less than 12 points have  __________________    2  ""One month"" shall be counted from the first day to the last day of a calendar month (e.g. 1-31 May)  or as the period extending from a date in one calendar month to the date preceding the  corresponding date in the following month (e.g. 15 May-14 June), as appropriate.    ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1    5/12  16-11041    been accrued, and subject to the provisions of sections 3.13 to 3.18. A negative points  balance shall be recorded in such cases up to a maximum of minus 12 points. To  become eligible for the next home leave, a staff member must make up the negative  points balance and then reach an accrual of 24 points, as the granting of advance home  leave does not advance the date of entitlement to the subsequent home leave.  3.10 The granting of advance home leave shall be subject to the conditions for the  entitlement being subsequently met. If those conditions are not met, the staff  member will be required to reimburse the costs paid by the Organization for the  advance home leave travel, including any associated costs.  3.11 Subject to the provisions of sections 3.12 to 3.18, a staff member may delay  the exercise of the home leave entitlement.        Maximum service credit points    3.12 While a staff member may delay exercising his or her home leave entitlement,  no more than 48 service credit points may be accrued towards the entitlement. Once  a staff member has accrued the maximum 48 points, he or she shall not accrue any  more points until he or she exercises his or her home leave entitlement. Accrual of  points shall start again on the first day of the month in which the staff member  departs on home leave travel. Any unused points balance shall be carried forward  and utilized for the next home leave, subject to sections 3.17 and 3.18.        Intervals between home leave travel and other types of travel    3.13 For staff members assigned to duty stations with a 24-month home leave cycle,  there shall normally be an interval of no less than 12 months of qualifying service  between the date of return from one home leave travel and the departure date of the  next home leave travel. In addition, there shall be an interval of no less than nine  months between home leave travel and family visit travel, to be counted from the  return date of one travel to the departure date of the other travel. Staff members  serving in duty stations with a 24-month home leave cycle shall not be authorized to  travel on home leave and family visit during the same calendar year.  3.14 For staff members assigned to duty stations with an accelerated 12-month  home leave cycle, there shall normally be an interval of no less than six months of  qualifying service between the date of return from one home leave travel and the  departure date of the next home leave travel. In addition, there shall normally be an  interval of no less than three months between home leave travel and family visit  travel, to be counted from the return date of one travel to the departure date of the  other travel.  3.15 For staff members serving in duty stations with a 24- or 12-month home leave  cycle, there shall normally be an interval of no less than three months of qualifying  service between travel by the staff member in lieu of education grant travel by the  child and home leave travel, counted from the date of return from one travel to the  departure date of the other travel.        Loss of entitlement to return travel expenses    3.16 Irrespective of the balance of accrued home leave service credit points, a staff  member who resigns before completing six months of service following the date of  his or her return from travel on home leave, or within three months for a staff  ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1      16-11041  6/12    member assigned to a duty station with a 12-month home leave cycle, shall not be  entitled to payment of return travel expenses, or to reimbursement of  unaccompanied shipment or removal expenses, for himself or herself and eligible  family members, unless the Secretary-General determines that there are compelling  reasons for authorizing such payment.        Loss of entitlement to home leave travel    3.17 A staff member shall lose his or her entitlement to home leave travel under any  of the following circumstances:    (a)  The staff member changes his or her recognized nationality to that of the  country of his or her duty station; or    (b)  The staff member is assigned or transferred to serve in his or her  recognized country of home leave or country of permanent residence; or    (c)  The staff member acquires the status of permanent resident in the country  of the duty station; or    (d)  In the case of locally recruited staff members on mission assignment,  upon return to the duty station at which they were recruited.  3.18 In the circumstances described in section 3.17 (a) to (d), the staff member 's  balance of service credit points shall be forfeited.        Section 4      Travel of eligible family members    4.1 The United Nations shall pay the travel expenses of eligible family members  on home leave, subject to the staff member fulfilling the eligibility requirements to  undertake home leave travel in accordance with staff rule 5.2 and the provisions of  the present instruction.  4.2 Eligible family members may undertake home leave travel, together or  separately, at a different time than the staff member if for family or work-related  reasons they are unable to travel together. In the case of separate home leave travel,  point deductions to the staff member's balance of service credit points shall apply  from the date of departure on home leave travel of the staff member. In the event  that a staff member becomes ineligible for home leave following the separate home  leave travel of his or her eligible family members, the staff member shall reimburse  the Organization for the cost of the home leave travel of the family members.  4.3 A staff member eligible for home leave travel in respect of his or her eligible  family members may request that home leave travel be exercised between a  dependent child's place of study away from the duty station and the place of home  leave. In such cases, the amount of travel expenses payable by the Organization  shall not exceed the cost of travel between the staff member's duty station and his or  her recognized place of home leave. If the cost of travel from the place of study is  more economical than that from the staff member's duty station, the amount payable  by the Organization shall be limited to the actual travel expenses incurred, provided  these do not exceed the approved standard of accommodation. 3   __________________    3  Section 4 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2013/3, entitled ""Official travel"", or as amended,  provides the standard of accommodation for air travel.    ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1    7/12  16-11041    4.4 For eligible dependent children, there shall normally be an interval of no less  than three months between travel on home leave and education grant travel, except  as provided for under section 8.1 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2011/4,  entitled ""Education grant and special education grant for children with a disability"".        Special conditions applicable when both spouses are staff members of organizations  of the United Nations common system    4.5 If both spouses are staff members of the United Nations common system who  are eligible for home leave, each staff member may choose to exercise his or her  own home leave entitlement or to accompany his or her spouse.  4.6  If each staff member chooses to exercise his or her own home leave entitlement  separately, eligible dependent children may accompany either parent but not both.  4.7 Whichever option is chosen, the frequency of travel shall not exceed the  established periodicity of home leave travel for both staff members and their  dependent children.  4.8 When both spouses are staff members of the United Nations common system  and only one of them is entitled to home leave travel, the other staff member is  considered an eligible family member and may accompany his or her spouse on  home leave travel in accordance with the provisions of sections 4.1 to 4.4 above. In  such cases, no travel time shall be granted to the accompanying spouse.        Travel of a newborn or adopted child    4.9  A dependent child born or adopted outside the duty station may be authorized ex  post facto to travel to the duty station of the staff member in conjunction with the  return leg of the staff member's home leave travel. When such travel is authorized, the  staff member may be entitled to the reimbursement of a one-way air ticket for his or  her new dependent child from the recognized place of home leave to the duty station,  as well as terminal expenses, excess baggage and unaccompanied shipment  entitlement.  4.10 When a dependent child born or adopted outside the duty station is authorized  to travel to the duty station under section 4.9 above, the staff member shall not be  entitled to payment of the settling-in grant with respect to the new dependent child,  unless the home leave travel was combined with travel on assignment or transfer to  another duty station in accordance with section 9.2 below.        Service in non-family duty stations    4.11 A staff member appointed, transferred or assigned to a non-family duty station  shall not be entitled to home leave travel in respect of his or her eligible family  members. However, when a staff member eligible for home leave travel is assigned  from a family duty station to a non-family duty station, the eligible family members  may travel from the family duty station to the place of home leave on a one-way  advance home leave travel. Should the eligible family members wish to travel to a  location other than the place of home leave, the cost of travel shall be limited to that  between the family duty station and the place of home leave. When eligible family  members travel on one-way advance home leave, the deduction of service credit  points shall be made at the time of departure of the staff member on his or her home  leave travel when it falls due.  ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1      16-11041  8/12    4.12 Where a staff member's eligible family members travelled on one-way  advance home leave following the staff member's assignment to a non-family duty  station, those eligible family members may travel on the return leg of the home  leave travel if the staff member returns to his or her previous family duty station  following the completion of his or her assignment. In the case where a staff member  is transferred or reassigned from the non-family duty station to a family duty station  that is not his or her previous duty station, the eligible family members may travel  to join the staff member on change of official duty station.        Section 5      Length of stay in the country of home leave    5.1 A staff member and his or her eligible family members travelling on home  leave shall be required to spend no less than seven calendar days, exclusive of travel  time, in his or her home country. The minimum stay of seven calendar days consists  of seven days and six nights, consecutive or otherwise, to be counted from midnight  on the night of arrival to midnight on the sixth night, during which the staff member  and his or her eligible family members are physically present in the authorized  country of home leave. Time spent travelling prior to arrival in, or after departure  from, the country of home leave shall not be counted towards the minimum seven- day stay in the home country.  5.2 The requirement to spend no less than seven calendar days, exclusive of travel  time, in the home country is applicable to both the staff member and the eligible  family members, whether they travel together or separately. However, in the latter  case, the staff member and his or her eligible family members are not required to  spend the seven days together at the same time in the home country.  5.3 Upon return from home leave travel, a staff member is required to provide  evidence that he or she has complied with the required minimum length of stay in  his or her home country. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, used  airline tickets and boarding passes, United Nations laissez-passer or national  passport containing the dates of arrival and departure from the country to which a  particular home leave travel was authorized.  5.4  Except for the number of days charged to travel time as defined under section  1 (g) and provided for in section 2.5 (c) above, the number of days absent from duty  while on home leave shall be charged to the staff member's annual leave balance,  unless the staff member's absence is otherwise charged to sick leave or maternity  leave, paternity leave, special leave with full pay in the case of adoption of a child or  special leave without pay approved under section 5.5 below. In the case of sick leave,  staff members shall be required to submit the necessary certification as required in  administrative instruction ST/AI/2005/3, entitled ""Sick leave"", or as amended.  5.5  Subject to the approval of the respective supervisors and executive offices or  local human resources or administrative offices, a staff member holding a fixed-term  or continuing appointment4 who is a mother or father of a newly born or adopted child  may utilize, as appropriate, authorized maternity leave, paternity leave, special leave  with full pay in case of adoption of a child or special leave without pay for a  __________________    4  Pursuant to staff rule 13.1, all permanent appointments shall be governed by the terms and  conditions applicable to continuing appointments under the Staff Regulations and the Staff  Rules, except as provided under the rule.    ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1    9/12  16-11041    maximum period of two years for childcare purposes while on home leave travel.  Where special leave without pay is authorized under the present section, no official  travel shall be undertaken while on special leave without pay. Such staff members  must be in full pay status when home leave travel is undertaken to and from the home.        Section 6      Change of country of home leave    6.1  The country of home leave shall be the country of the staff member's recognized  nationality for United Nations purposes. However, in exceptional and compelling  circumstances, the Secretary-General may authorize a country other than the country  of nationality as the country of home leave as detailed in section 6.2 below.  6.2 For a change of the country of home leave to be authorized, all of the  conditions set out in staff rule 5.2 (d) (iii) a must be met as follows:    (a)  The staff member maintained normal residence in such other country for  a prolonged period, that is, a minimum of five years consecutively, immediately  preceding his or her appointment with the Organization;    (b)  The staff member continues to have close family and personal ties in that  country;    (c)  Taking home leave in that country would not be inconsistent with the  purposes and intent of the home leave.  6.3 A change of country of home leave may be granted only once in a staff  member's entire service with the Organization, including service in another United  Nations common system organization. Once a change of country of home leave has  been authorized, it is deemed as a permanent change, and no change shall be made  to revert to the original country of home leave on the basis of the staff member's  recognized nationality.  6.4 When such a permanent change of country of home leave has been authorized,  the Organization shall bear the home leave travel and transportation costs to the  newly designated country of home leave.        Section 7      Place of home leave within the country of home leave        Determination of the place of home leave within the country of home leave    7.1 The place of home leave within the staff member's home country shall be, for  the purpose of travel and transportation entitlements, the place with which the staff  member had the closest residential ties during the period of his or her most recent  residence in the home country. The place of home leave within the country of home  leave is determined at the time of appointment on the basis of the information  provided by the staff member in his or her personal history profile.  7.2 If a staff member finds that an error was made in the initial determination of  his or her place of home leave within the home country, he or she may request that it  be corrected on the basis that his or her closest ties prior to his or her appointment  were with another place within the home country. Such request shall be submitted to  the Office of Human Resources Management at Headquarters or the local human  resources office in offices away from Headquarters, prior to the exercise of the first  ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1      16-11041  10/12    home leave. For the staff member's request to be approved, he or she shall provide  evidence to the satisfaction of the Secretary-General that his or her closest ties in  the home country prior to his or her appointment were with a place other than the  one originally designated.  7.3 The place of home leave determines the staff member's travel and  transportation entitlements. The staff member may, in the exercise of his or her  home leave entitlement, travel to any place within the home leave country. In such  case, the travel and transportation expenses borne by the Organization shall not  exceed the cost of travel to the recognized place of home leave within the home  country. If the cost of the staff member's travel is more economical than that to the  place of home leave, the amount payable by the United Nations shall be limited to  the actual travel expenses incurred, provided these do not exceed the approved  standard of accommodation.        Change of the place of home leave within the country of home leave    7.4 A change in the place of home leave within the country of home leave may be  authorized in exceptional circumstances under the following conditions:    (a)  The staff member must have a minimum of five years of continuous  service; and    (b)  The staff member must provide evidence that he or she has established  substantially greater ties with another place within the home country compared with  the originally designated place of home leave.  7.5 A change of place of home leave within the home country may be granted only  once during a staff member's service with the Organization.        Section 8      Travel to a country other than the recognized country of home leave    8.1 Travel to a country other than the country of home leave may be authorized for  any home leave year, provided that the staff member demonstrates to the satisfaction  of the Secretary-General that he or she has close family or personal ties in that  country. The amount of travel and transportation expenses borne by the  Organization shall not exceed the cost of travel to the place of home leave. If the  cost of the staff member's travel to the other country is more economical than that  to the recognized place of home leave, the amount payable by the Organization shall  be limited to the actual travel expenses incurred, provided these do not exceed the  approved standard of accommodation for home leave travel.  8.2 Travel to a country other than the country of home leave may also be  authorized where, because of war, civil strife or political unrest or for other security  reasons, the staff member or his or her eligible family members are unable to travel  to the country of home leave. In such cases, the staff member may be authorized to  travel to a neighbouring country with social and cultural affinities to the home  country or to another country as provided under section 8.1.  8.3 Authorization to travel to a country other than the country of home leave under  sections 8.1 and 8.2 above is given on a one-time basis, and the staff member shall  be required to make a request each time he or she wishes to travel to a country other  than the country of home leave.    ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1    11/12  16-11041    8.4 Staff members assigned to duty stations with a 12-month home leave cycle  may exercise every other home leave travel to a country other than the country of  home leave, provided that a period not less than seven calendar days, exclusive of  travel time, is spent in the country of travel. The amount of travel expenses payable  by the United Nations in such cases shall not exceed the cost of travel to the place  of home leave. If the cost of the staff member's travel is more economical than that  to the place of home leave, the amount payable by the United Nations shall be  limited to the actual travel expenses incurred, provided these do not exceed the  approved standard of accommodation. Every second home leave entitlement must  be exercised to the country of home leave, or to another country where the staff  member has close family or personal ties, as provided for in section 8.1 above.        Section 9      Travel arrangements    9.1  Travel on home leave shall be arranged in accordance with administrative  instruction ST/AI/2013/3, entitled ""Official travel"". A staff member shall claim  expenses for authorized home leave travel for himself or herself and his or her eligible  family members in accordance with sections 6 and 13 of that administrative  instruction.  9.2 When home leave travel is combined with travel on official business or change  of official duty station, the standard of travel accommodation for the official  business and combined home leave travel shall be economy class.  9.3 Staff members who wish to exercise their entitlement to home leave travel  shall be required to inform their executive offices or local human resources or  administrative offices of their travel plans normally two months in advance of the  anticipated departure date.  9.4 The procedures for the exercise of the lump-sum option for travel by air on  home leave are provided in administrative instruction ST/AI/2013/3 and information  circular ST/IC/2001/43, or as amended. However, it should be noted that when a  staff member's home leave travel is combined with travel on official business, the  staff member may exercise the lump-sum option only in respect of his or her  eligible family members.        Section 10      Home leave travel request      While the staff member's supervisor approves the annual leave request for the  absence of the staff member from work, the eligibility review and the authority to  approve home leave travel resides with the executive offices for staff members  serving at Headquarters and with the local human resources or administrative  offices for staff members serving at other locations outside Headquarters. Staff  members should therefore address their home leave travel requests to their  respective Executive Office or local human resources or administrative office,  irrespective of the option chosen to exercise their entitlement.    ST/AI/2015/2/Rev.1      16-11041  12/12        Section 11      Transitional measures for establishing the points system in duty stations with a  24-month home leave cycle    11.1 The former system of ""odd"" and ""even"" years for duty stations with a  24-month home leave cycle is hereby replaced by a home leave service credit points  system which shall be applicable to staff members at all duty stations in accordance  with section 3 above. As a result, the concept of ""deferred home leave"" is replaced  by the 48-point maximum accrual of home leave service credit points as set out in  section 3.12 above.  11.2 The determination of a staff member's initial points balance shall be based on  a simulation of the points accrued since the last home leave exercised by the staff  member, provided that such home leave was neither delayed nor advanced. Should  the last home leave exercised by the staff member have been delayed or advanced,  the simulation of points shall be based on the last home leave exercised as regular  home leave, adjusting the points for the delayed or advanced home leave(s)  subsequently taken.        Section 12      Final provisions    12.1 The present instruction shall enter into force on 1 July 2016.  12.2 Administrative instruction ST/AI/2015/2, entitled ""Home leave"", is hereby  superseded.

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members who hold a G-4  visa and employ a household employee to whom a G-5 visa has been granted of a  diplomatic note received from the United States Mission to the United Nations (see  annex). The note concerns changes to the minimum hourly wage to be paid to such  household employees.   2.  The United States Mission advises the Secretariat that the City of New York has  raised the prevailing minimum wage for domestic workers to $13.50 per hour in the  New York City metropolitan area for the period from 31 December 2018 to  30 December 2019.   3.  The United States Mission also advises that, for all hours worked, personal  servants, attendants and domestic workers who are in the United States with  non-immigrant G-5 visa status must be paid the highest applicable minimum wage  under United States federal or state law or the prevailing minimum wage in the  location where they are employed. All domestic employees on G-5 visas in the  New York City metropolitan area must therefore be paid according to the prevailing  minimum wage, which is $13.50 per hour for all hours worked. All new and existing  contracts between domestic workers and their employers must reflect at least the  minimum hourly wage established for the New York City metropolitan area.   4.  In addition, the United States Mission maintains that it is not permissible to  withhold from wages any amount for meals, housing or other expenses, such as the  provision of medical care, medical insurance or travel, as set out in diplomatic note  HC-59-(S)-14, dated 3 July 2014 (available from https://usun.usmission.gov/wp- content/uploads/sites/296/229759.pdf).      __________________    *  The present circular, which will be in effect until further notice, supersedes ST/IC/2018/12.  ST/IC/2019/21      19-17195  2/2    Annex        Diplomatic note dated 6 December 2018 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations addressed to the Secretariat         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to refer to its circular diplomatic note  HC-05-(S)-18, dated 31 January 2018 (available at https://usun.state.gov/6659),  regarding the employment of domestic workers who are in the United States in  non-immigrant G-5 status. The United Nations Secretariat will note that, for all hours  worked, such domestic workers must be paid the greater of the minimum wage under  United States federal or state law or the prevailing wage in the specific location (city  and state) of the residence where the domestic worker is employed.     The United States Mission wishes to inform the United Nations Secretariat that,  according to article 19 of the New York State Labor Law, all employees in New York  State, including domestic workers, must be paid at least the applicable hourly wage  rate. The City of New York has updated its minimum wage requirement to $13.50 per  hour for the period beginning 31 December 2018 and ending 30 December 2019. The  current minimum wage rate for employers with less than 10 employees in the  New York City area may be found online at the New York State Department of Labor  website (www.labor.ny.gov/workerprotection/laborstandards/workprot/minwage.shtm).     Therefore, domestic workers employed in residences in the New York City  metropolitan area must be paid in accordance with the local minimum wage rate noted  above. In addition, all new contracts between domestic workers and their employers  must reflect the updated wage amounts and all existing contracts already in effect  must be amended to reflect the updated wage amounts, with the changes initialled by  both the domestic worker and the employer.

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff of a diplomatic note dated  7 December 2015 from the United States Mission to the United Nations regarding  the imposition of certain fees associated with the provision of privileges and  benefits by the Office of Foreign Missions of the United States Department of State  (see annex).   2.  The Office of Foreign Missions requires non-United States citizens to strictly  comply with its policies and specific requirements when requesting products and  documents. Failure to do so will result in additional expenses for the Office, which  must devote significant amounts of time and resources to corrective actions.   3.   The note sets out the following fees for failure to comply with the  Department's policies and requirements or the replacement or reissuance of  products or documents that are lost, damaged or need to be corrected with a  deliverable address:    (a)  A service fee of $100 for failure to comply with licensing and vehicle  registration requirements;    (b)  A service fee of $25 for the replacement of each lost or damaged document  issued by the Office. The service fee will be waived if the replacement application for  a stolen document is accompanied by a copy of the related police report;    (c)  A service fee of $25 for the reissuance of each document due to an  incorrect address;    (d)  A reprocessing fee of $25 to change or correct information listed on the  title of a motor vehicle;    (e)  A non-compliance fee of $100 on all applications submitted to the Office  concerning the sale or transfer of a motor vehicle or the issuance of an export title  received after the 30-day grace period following the date of termination of an  assignment.    * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2016/8      16-02451  2/3    Annex       Diplomatic note dated 7 December 2015 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations Secretariat and wishes to outline the Department of State policy  concerning its imposition of certain fees associated with the Department's provision  of privileges to eligible United Nations staff and their members in certain instances  where additional demands are placed upon the Department's resources.    The majority of the members of the United Nations Secretariat abide by the  Department's requirements associated with the provision of privileges and benefits  by the Office of Foreign Missions, and the Office has asked the United States  Mission to convey its appreciation for compliance with those requirements.     However, when such requirements are not followed, the Office must devote  significant amounts of time and resources to corrective matters. Furthermore,  reissuance of products and documents by the Office generates an additional expense  in terms of staff resources and production costs.     Therefore, the Department has decided that the United Nations Secretariat and  its members who create additional resource demands by failing to comply with the  Department's policies and the relevant laws and regulations of the United States, or  request the replacement or reissuance of Office-issued products or documents that  are lost, damaged, or need to be corrected with a deliverable address, should bear a  portion of the cost associated with resolving such matters.        Failure to comply with licensing and vehicle registration requirements      The United Nations Secretariat is reminded that the Office of Foreign  Missions is the exclusive licensing and motor vehicle registration and titling  authority in the United States for foreign missions, members of foreign missions  and their families who enjoy immunity from legal process.    For any United Nations Secretariat staff member or dependant who, contrary  to the Department's requirements obtains or maintains a driver's licence or vehicle  registration from one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or any United States  territory, the Office will issue a Department of State driver's licence or registration  (including the associated licence plate, registration card, and decal) only upon  payment of a service fee of $100 for each vehicle being registered and for each  individual being issued a driver's licence.        Replacement of lost or damaged documents      In the event of loss or damage to the following Office-issued documents, the  Office will issue a replacement document only upon payment of a service fee of $25  for each document replaced:    * Motor Vehicle Registration Card    * Registration Decal    * Licence Plate    * Driver's Licence    * Non-Driver Identification Card    ST/IC/2016/8    3/3  16-02451      * Motor Vehicle Title    * Tax Exemption Card    For any Licence Plates, Driver's Licences, Non-Driver Identification Cards or  Tax Exemption Cards that were reported to law enforcement as stolen, the Office  will waive the replacement service fee when a copy of the related police report  accompanies the replacement application(s). The initial issuance of all the items  above will continue to be issued free of charge.        Corrections to documents issued by the Office of Foreign Missions      If a United Nations Secretariat staff member provides an incorrect address  which causes the Office-issued document to be undeliverable, the Office must be  notified of the correct address to ensure that the documents will be successfully  delivered to their intended recipient.    If a United Nations Secretariat staff member requests the replacement of the  following Office-issued documents due to an incorrect address provided by the  United Nations staff member, the Office will reissue the document only upon  payment of a service fee of $25 for each document reissued:    * Motor Vehicle Registration Card    * Driver's Licence    * Non-Driver Identification Card    * Motor Vehicle Title    * Tax Exemption Card        Change to motor vehicle titles      Once a Department of State motor vehicle title has been issued, the Office will  charge a $25 reprocessing fee to change information listed on the title, such as a  new buyer or a correction to the buyer's name or address.        Failure to timely transfer or export vehicles at the end of an assignment      All United Nations Secretariat staff members who are required to register and title  their motor vehicles with the Office are required to return their Department-issued  licence plates to the Office within 30 days of the termination of their assignment.    A $100 non-compliance fee will be assessed on all applications submitted to  the Office concerning either the sale/transfer of a motor vehicle or the issuance of  an export title received more than 30 days after the termination of assignment.    The United Nations Secretariat is requested to communicate this important  information to all personnel and their family members. The United Nations Secretariat  may direct any questions in this regard to the Office of Foreign Missions by telephone  at (646) 282-2825; by electronic mail at ofmnycustomerservice@state.gov. Information  concerning the Office's Regional Office is available from www.state.gov/ofm/ro/  index.htm.

Mission subsistence allowance shall comprise the total  contribution of the United Nations towards such costs.         Section 2      Eligibility    2.1 Mission subsistence allowance shall be payable to non-staff personnel provided  by a Government to serve with the United Nations when they are deployed in an  individual capacity to field missions, including a peacekeeping operation, special  political mission or other field mission, to serve as United Nations police officers,  military observers, military advisers, military liaison officers, staff officers and  non-uniformed civilian personnel, including corrections officers.   2.2 The mission area shall be defined by the Assistant Secretary-General for Human  Resources, in consultation with the Under-Secretaries-General for Peace Operations,  Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Operational Support, and the head of the  relevant field mission, as appropriate, and in accordance with relevant resolutions of  the Security Council and/or the General Assembly.        Section 3      Mission subsistence allowance rates    3.1 The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources shall establish mission  subsistence allowance rates per country on an annual basis or pursuant to an ad hoc  review as set forth below. Mission subsistence allowance rates shall be published.  ST/AI/2021/2      21-07740  2/5    3.2 There shall be at least two rates of mission subsistence allowance in each  country. A higher rate shall apply during the first 30 calendar days of a tour of duty  in a mission area to compensate for expenditures related to the initial set-up of  non-staff personnel and to defray the normally higher accommodation, meal and  miscellaneous expenses incurred upon relocation to a mission area, and a reduced rate  is applicable thereafter. The higher ""first 30 days"" rate shall be payable at the start of  the tour of duty in a mission area and upon any subsequent authorized relocation to a  different country within the mission area, provided it is beyond commuting distance.        ""First 30 days"" rate    3.3 The ""first 30 days"" rate shall be equal to the ""first 60 days"" rate of the standard  daily subsistence allowance established by the International Civil Service  Commission, in effect on 1 December of the preceding calendar year, normally for  the location in which the headquarters of the field mission is located. The rate shall  have accommodation, meals and miscellaneous components.         ""After 30 days"" rate    3.4 The ""after 30 days"" rate shall be established with reference to the location used  in section 3.3 above and shall consist of the following:     (a)  An accommodation component based on long-term housing data in effect  on 1 December of the preceding calendar year computed by the International Civil  Service Commission;     (b)  A meals component based on the meals component of the ""after 60 days""  rate of the standard daily subsistence allowance established by the International Civil  Service Commission, in effect on 1 December of the preceding calendar year; and     (c)  A miscellaneous component, which shall be fixed at 15 per cent of the sum  of the accommodation and meals components.  3.5 In no case shall the ""after 30 days"" rate exceed the ""first 30 days"" rate.  3.6 Where the standard daily subsistence allowance rate used to establish the ""after  30 days"" rate of mission subsistence allowance, as described in section 3.4 above,  increases by more than 50 per cent, an ad hoc review may be authorized by the  Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources.

Family members of United Nations officials are also exempt from the  requirement to provide personal identification provided they present a valid United  Nations family certificate together with their national passport and a valid visa, if  required.   5.  The text of the note verbale is set out in the annex to the present circular.        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2007/51      07-66161  2    Annex       Note verbale dated 19 November 2007 from the Permanent Mission  of Japan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General        The Permanent Mission of Japan to the United Nations presents its  compliments to the Secretariat of the United Nations and, with reference to the  former's note verbale No. SC/07/559 dated 16 October 2007, has the honour to  inform the latter of the following.    As regards the landing permission in Japan for United Nations officers,  heretofore, if a United Nations officer presented a valid passport issued by one of  the countries mentioned in the annex to this note that have visa exemption  arrangements with Japan, the officer did not need to obtain a visa. If such United  Nations officer was presenting a valid United Nations laissez-passer only, the officer  was required to obtain a valid visa in advance in the United Nations laissez-passer.  A United Nations officer presenting a valid passport issued by a country other than  those mentioned in enclosure 1 to the present note verbale that does not have visa  exemption arrangements with Japan was required to obtain a valid visa in advance  in the passport or in a valid United Nations laissez-passer.    The immigration law of Japan was amended for the purpose of establishing a  framework of preventive measures against acts of terrorism, illegal overstay and  other violations, and the new law requires foreign nationals to provide personal  identification information (i.e., fingerprints and a facial photograph) before they can  be granted landing permission, from 20 November 2007. A United Nations officer  travelling to Japan on official duty, however, is exempted from the obligation to  provide personal identification information by presenting a valid United Nations  laissez-passer and meeting the necessary requirements mentioned above, as  heretofore. An immediate family member (spouse and/or eligible children) of a  United Nations officer who presents a valid United Nations family certificate  together with his or her national passport at the time of landing inspection in Japan  will be exempted from the obligation to provide personal identification information.    If there is a need for further information, such as regarding cases other than  those mentioned above or other circumstances, the Permanent Mission of Japan will  be pleased to respond promptly. The text of articles 1, 2 and 6 of the revised  Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act (Act No. 319 of 1951) (see  enclosure 2) is provided for reference.    The Permanent Mission of Japan has further the honour to request the  Secretariat to circulate the aforementioned information throughout the United  Nations system and among its affiliated organizations.

"travel","  United Nations    ST/IC/2019/16      Secretariat      8 July 2019        19-11572 (E)    100719  *1911572*         Information circular*        To: Members of the staff      From: The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources         Subject:  Official travel      1.  The purpose of the present circular is to provide staff members with detailed  information on official travel, which is governed by the provisions of administrative  instruction ST/AI/2013/3, as amended, on official travel (""the instruction""), or as  superseded, and to familiarize staff members with the application of the Umoja travel  module for official travel.        Categories of travellers     2.  For the purposes of the present circular, the categories of travellers are:    (a)  Staff members: travellers who hold a letter of appointment under the  United Nations staff regulations and staff rules for either a temporary, fixed-term,  continuing or permanent appointment;     (b)  Other travellers: This category of individuals includes but it is not limited  to family members of staff members, United Nations officials other than Secretariat  staff members, members of organs or subsidiary organs of the United Nations,  participants in advisory meetings, consultants, individual contractors, United Nations  Volunteers and uniformed personnel.         Primary consideration regarding whether face-to-face contact is required    3.  Prior to initiating official travel, staff members and other travellers, if  applicable, in coordination with programme managers or Umoja travel and shipment  approvers, must explore and confirm that direct face-to-face contact is indeed  necessary,  that  all  other  alternative  methods  (such  as  videoconference,  audioconference or other remote business methods) have been carefully reviewed and  were found not to be effective, and that physical travel is therefore necessary. Only if  physical travel is indeed required should an Umoja travel request be submitted.         * The present circular will be in effect until further notice and supersedes ST/IC/2001/43,  ST/IC/2001/43/Add.1, ST/IC/2001/43/Amend.1, ST/IC/2001/43/Amend.2,  ST/IC/2001/43/Amend.3 and ST/IC/2001/43/Amend.4.  ST/IC/2019/16      19-11572  2/7        Authorization for official travel    4.  Staff members shall be responsible for ascertaining that they have the proper  authorization before commencing travel. Prior to raising a travel request, staff  members and other travellers, if applicable, must submit a corresponding absence  request in the Umoja employee self-service time management module and obtain  approval from their programme manager.  5.  All travel at the Organization's expense for all categories of travellers must be  processed through the Umoja travel module. Travel by commercial aircraft or train  may not be procured via purchase order, contract or other means.  6.  Travel undertaken at no expense to the Organization is subject to the travel  policy of the Organization and requires the creation of an Umoja travel authorization  or expense report in order to build a comprehensive travel history for the traveller and  thus ensure that the administration can administer entitlements in a timely and correct  manner.         Trips that do not require the creation of a travel request prior to departure    7.  A travel request is not required to be created in Umoja by the traveller prior to  departure if the following four conditions are met:    (a)  No more than three nights of daily subsistence allowance (DSA) or  mission subsistence allowance will be claimed by the traveller;    (b)  No travel advance is required by the traveller;    (c)  The mode of travel does not include passage on a commercial aircraft,  train, bus or ferry purchased by the Organization in advance (in which case, adherence  to the 16-day requirement in section 3.3 of the instruction is not necessary);    (d)  No personal deviation is being requested.  8.  However, a prior written authorization (such as email) from the programme  manager continues to be required, in accordance with section 3.1 of the instruction.   9.  Travellers covered under appendix D to the Staff Rules will continue to be  covered as long as the travel was authorized or confirmed, pursuant to section 3.1 of  the instruction, by the programme manager in writing (such as by email).  10. In these circumstances, the submission of a post facto stand-alone expense  report in the Umoja travel module will suffice. Staff members and other travellers, if  applicable, must submit a stand-alone expense report within seven working days of  the trip end date.         Purchase of tickets    11.  All travel agencies or travel management companies shall be contractually  obliged to provide the most economical tickets available, in accordance with United  Nations policies,1 at the time of purchase.   12. Should a traveller become aware that a more economical ticket is available from  a different source, the traveller may alert the respective travel processing office and  provide supporting documents such as screen shots, quotations and any other relevant  information. A meaningful comparison is normally only possible at the same time as  ticket issuance, as the true cost of a ticket is only established at that point in time.  __________________    1  Section 4.2 of the instruction, in accordance with staff rule 7.6 (f), requires the normal route for  all official travel to be the most economical route available.    ST/IC/2019/16    3/7  19-11572    13. In this context, in establishing the authorized itinerary, due consideration should  be given to the total cost of travel, (e.g. additional DSA required for stops and  additional fees for services not included in some discount/basic fares, such as baggage  fees and onboard meal) and not simply the ticket price.        Advance purchase of tickets    14. Pursuant to staff rule 7.8 and section 3.3 of the instruction, individuals travelling  on behalf of the United Nations by commercial air paid for by the United Nations  (including on self-ticketed itineraries that are reimbursed by the United Nations),  should obtain the approval of the travel processing office for the Umoja travel request  16 calendar days in advance of the commencement of official travel.  15. Five calendar days have been provided for obtaining the necessary travel request  approvals in Umoja (from the travel and shipment approver, travel processing office  and, when applicable, human resources partner). Staff members or travel  administrators are therefore required to submit travel requests at least 21 calendar  days prior to the commencement of travel, to ensure timely finalization of the travel  arrangements in accordance with the instruction.  16. Staff members or travel administrators are required to provide a justification in  Umoja for travel requests submitted less than 21 calendar days in advance of the  commencement of travel. The travel and shipment approver is responsible for  reviewing the justification provided and for seeking additional information and/or  clarification, if deemed necessary.        Medical clearances    17. Prior to the start of travel, it is the traveller's individual responsibility to obtain  the required medical clearances with the Health-Care Management and Occupational  Safety and Health Division of the Department of Operational Support or the  designated United Nations medical service.  18. Approvers and travel and shipment approvers are not required to ensure that  medical clearance is obtained prior to the approval of the travel request, unless  otherwise explicitly requested by the Health-Care Management and Occupational  Safety and Health Division or the designated United Nations medical service to  address possible emergencies (e.g. specific concerns in the region).        Security clearances    19. It is the traveller's individual responsibility to obtain the required security  clearances prior to the commencement of all travel. Failure to obtain the required  security clearance prior to travel may result in the traveller becoming ineligible to  make a claim under the malicious acts insurance policy.   20. Approvers and travel and shipment approvers are not responsible to ensure that  security clearance has or will be obtained and that the required security awareness  training (such as BSAFE) has been completed prior to the approval of a travel request.  However, they are to remind travellers of their obligation to obtain the security  clearance and complete required training prior to travel.        Discounted airfares and travel on United Nations aircraft     21. In line with sections 4.2 and 4.6 of the instruction, discounted airfares, including  restricted fares and travel on so-called ""low-cost"" carriers, are considered in the  determination of the most economical route. The Organization does not exclude any  air carriers owing to the lack of provision of services such as free checked baggage  ST/IC/2019/16      19-11572  4/7    or free on-board meals. However, any comparisons should be made in the context of  the consideration of the total cost of travel, as set out in paragraph 13 above.  22. Travel on United Nations aircraft will count towards the computation of the total  travel time of a journey for the purpose of determining the standard of  accommodation, as long as it forms an integral leg of the total journey. 2        Deviations for personal convenience from the approved route, mode of  transportation or standard of accommodation    23. Staff members must indicate for themselves and/or for their eligible family  members their intent to deviate for reasons of personal convenience from the  approved mode, dates, route or standard of accommodation when submitting a travel  request in Umoja, in accordance with chapter VII of the Staff Rules and section 7 of  the instruction, as amended. By requesting the deviation in Umoja, the traveller will  be provided information on the risks and conditions attached to a personal deviation  (the relevant details are available in the Umoja travel request).        Travel on training    24. To ensure the correct application of the travel policy, all travellers whose travel  is related to training must indicate in the ""comments"" section of the travel request  whether they are travelling as ""trainer"" or ""trainee"". This annotation will be validated  during the travel and shipment approval process.         Reimbursement of expenses during a forced stopover     25. Travel on home leave and family visit shall be arranged in accordance with  sections 6, 12 and 13 of the instruction. There is no entitlement to DSA for travel time  on home leave and family visit. Actual costs for meals, accommodation and  incidentals not exceeding the corresponding portions of the established DSA rate for  the location are reimbursable for an authorized unavoidable stopover while on home  leave or family visit, or education grant travel in cases in which the Organization has  provided the air ticket and the airline does not provide meals or lodging.        Terminal expenses    26. Payment of terminal expenses is governed by section 9 of the instruction. Staff  members are reimbursed terminal expenses for transportation between the airport or  other point of arrival or departure and the hotel or other place of dwelling. For New  York, the amounts to be reimbursed for each trip are $78 in respect of the staff member  and $26 for each family member authorized to travel at the United Nations expense.  For all other duty stations, the amounts to be reimbursed for each trip are $47 in  respect of the staff member and $16 for each family member authorized to travel at  the United Nations expense.  27. When an official United Nations, government or any other type of transport is  made available free of charge for the trip, the amounts to be paid are set at $14 in  respect of the staff member and $7 for each family member.  28. The normal mode of travel for all official travel is air travel, in line with staff  rule 7.6 (c). In accordance with section 9.3 of the instruction, terminal expenses are  deemed to cover all expenses for transportation between the airport or other point of  arrival or departure and the hotel or other place of dwelling, including transfer of  baggage and other related incidental charges. In this respect, ""other point of arrival  __________________    2  See http://tts.un.org for specific examples of common business scenarios to which these  provisions apply.    ST/IC/2019/16    5/7  19-11572    or departure"" shall refer to locations other than an airport (e.g. train terminals) only  when the mode or type of travel (e.g. train) has been approved as the alternative that  fully replaces travel by air.         Miscellaneous travel expenses     29. Section 10 of the instruction contains a list of the categories of non-receipted  expenses under $30 that may be reimbursed where authorized. Scanned receipts for  claims described in this section are not required to be attached to the expense report  but must be retained in line with paragraph 45 below. The ""other forms of  communication"" referred to in section 10 (b) of the instruction include possible  Internet connection charges. Furthermore, a flat fee of $15 is reimbursable as a  non-receipted expense in cases in which the airline does not provide meals free of  charge on a flight that is longer than six hours.         Lump-sum option for travel on home leave, family visit or education grant travel    30. Staff members who wish to exercise this option should initiate the travel request  in Umoja at least two months in advance of the anticipated departure date and request  information on the amount of the lump sum. The travel request will be routed to the  human resources partner for review and approval of the entitlement and subsequently  to the travel processing office, which will establish the lump-sum amount in  accordance with section 12 of the instruction.   31. Once the staff member has been informed by the travel processing office about  the amount of the lump sum for the requested travel, the staff member will have  10 business days to accept the lump sum or opt for a United Nations-provided air  ticket, in Umoja. It is important to remember that if a response is not received within  that time frame, the lump-sum option may not be granted.  32. All lump-sum calculations should be made by a travel processing office using a  global distribution system and calculated in United States dollars. Guidelines for the  determination of lump-sum payments can be found on the web page of the Travel and  Transportation Section.3        Self-ticketing    33. Staff members and other travellers, if applicable, may be authorized to purchase  their own tickets (""self-ticket"") pursuant to staff rule 7.8. A self-ticketing option may  be approved, regardless of the ticket value, when deemed to be in the best interest of  the Organization4 and subject to a maximum reimbursement amount established by  the relevant travel processing office.   34. The following self-ticketing process is to be adhered to:5    (a)  A travel request must be entered in Umoja, with detailed justification of  the request for self-ticketing in the ""comments"" field;    (b)  The travel and shipment approver will review and then endorse or reject  the justification;    (c)  The travel processing office will evaluate the request for self-ticketing and  approve the request, if it is deemed advantageous to the Organization;   __________________    3  http://tts.un.org.    4  Common scenarios for which a self-ticket option may be in the best interest of the Organization  can be found at http://tts.un.org.    5  Further details are available in the relevant Umoja travel job aid, available at:  https://umoja.un.org/content/travel-job-aids.  ST/IC/2019/16      19-11572  6/7      (d)  The travel processing office will communicate the maximum reimbursable  amount calculated as the ticket portion of the amount authorized for the journey on  the approved dates and by the approved mode, route and standard of travel to the staff  member and other travellers, if applicable, so as to avoid any misunderstandings  during the reimbursement process;    (e)  In purchasing their tickets, staff members must comply with the approved  dates, mode, route and standard of travel;     (f)  Upon return from travel, the staff member and other travellers, if  applicable, must submit an expense report in Umoja that is linked to the previously  approved Umoja travel request for self-ticketing.  35. All requests for self-ticketing must be submitted well in advance, to ensure  compliance with the 16-day advance purchase policy.  36. It is important to note that staff members and other travellers, if applicable, who  purchase tickets without an approved travel request in Umoja risk not being  reimbursed or only receiving partial reimbursement.   37. All claims for reimbursement in the expense report must be supported by a  scanned copy of the invoice paid by the traveller, and the proof of travel should be  retained by the staff member and other travellers, if applicable, in line with paragraph  45 below.   38. Charges for additional value-added services (e.g. premium seat selection and  priority boarding) are the financial responsibility of the traveller and are not  reimbursable.   39. In the event of any changes to the planned travel, the traveller is responsible for  managing any associated change and refund requests directly with the ticket provider.   40. Travellers must also request and obtain security and medical clearances for their  approved travel, where applicable, and ensure that visa and United Nations laissez- passer requirements are in order prior to travel.         Travel advances    41. As per section 11 of the instruction, travel advances will only include DSA  and/or terminal expenses applicable to the category of the traveller. Advances for  official business travel will be issued up to five days in advance of the travel date,  whereas advances for lump sums can be issued from eight weeks prior to the travel  date. No travel advances should be made for trips with a total duration of less than  24 hours. In cases in which such advances are required to avoid undue financial  hardship on the traveller, the travel and shipment approver can manually enter the  travel advance payable in the travel request.  42. No advance payment shall be made in respect of miscellaneous travel expenses,  which may include costs incurred for self-ticketing. Such expenses should be claimed  through the expense report functionality upon completion of the trip.  43. Once the travel processing office has approved the travel request, a travel  advance can be paid only once by the system. Any additional travel advances must be  requested offline from the local travel finance or travel claims team and will only be  processed if it exceeds $1,000; reimbursement for lesser amounts should be requested  through the expense report upon completion of the trip.         Travel claims    44. Staff members are not required to attach a scanned copy of boarding passes (or  a passenger manifest, in the case of United Nations aircraft) to the respective expense    ST/IC/2019/16    7/7  19-11572    report for any type of travel, except under exceptional circumstances (such as travel  funded by donor grant) which may require the provision of the boarding pass as a  scanned attachment. When travel is arranged on behalf of travellers who are not staff  members, the travel administrator is responsible for retaining the original documents  to support any claims.  45. Proof of travel and travel expenses must be retained by the staff member (or the  travel administrator, if travel was arranged on behalf of a traveller who is not a staff  member) for a period of five years, in line with the instruction.  46. Staff members and travel administrators must submit the expense report for their  or their travellers' trips within two weeks of the authorized return travel date. The  submission of an expense report is applicable for both ticket (including self-ticketing)  and lump-sum options. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in an  automatic recovery of the travel advance or lump sum through payroll for staff  members. For non-staff, a credit memo will be placed against the travellers' vendor  account, which will prevent future payments from being made until it is cleared by  approval of the expense report.   47. Travellers are entitled to claim reimbursement for meals on the last day of  official travel, against original receipts, and at a cost not exceeding the meals portion  of the applicable DSA rate.        Early check-in and/or late check-out to/from hotels    48. In exceptional circumstances in which travel arranged or approved by the  Organization results in a traveller incurring charges for having to check in early or  check out late to or from a hotel, the traveller may claim reimbursement, assuming  the travel request is duly approved and scanned receipts are attached to the expense  report.6 The traveller will be reimbursed the actual accommodation cost, not to exceed  the accommodation portion of the standard DSA rate.         Travel documents    49. It is the traveller's responsibility to ensure that all required travel documents are  valid and accurate and to obtain the necessary visa(s) for the destination, transit stops  and return travel, where applicable, prior to departure. United Nations-issued travel  documents (i.e. laissez-passer, United Nations certificate or family certificate)  complement the holder's national passport, but do not replace government-issued  travel documents. Further information on travel documents can be found in the Guide  to the Issuance of United Nations Travel Documents.7    __________________    6  See http://tts.un.org for specific examples of common business scenarios to which these  provisions apply.    7  Available via http://tts.un.org, or at https://iseek-newyork.un.org/system/files/iseek/  LibraryDocuments/593-2006012715561757377.pdf.

ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1      24-09646  2/11    rule 7.2 and the conditions specified by the Secretary-General in respect of specific  forms of official travel.  2.3 Pursuant to staff rule 7.2 (g), the Secretary-General may reject any claim for  payment or reimbursement of travel expenses which are incurred by a staff member  in contravention of any provision of the Staff Rules and the present administrative  instruction.        Section 3      Authorization for official travel    3.1 Under staff rule 7.1, all official travel must be authorized in writing before it is  undertaken. In exceptional cases, staff members may be orally authorized to travel.  In such cases, written confirmation shall be required as soon as possible, and no later  than two calendar weeks after completion of travel.  3.2 Prior to authorizing any official travel, the primary consideration should be  whether direct face-to-face contact is necessary for mandate implementation. If not,  then alternative methods should be employed. Therefore, programme managers are  required to certify in the Organization's enterprise resource planning system (Umoja)  that alternative methods, such as videoconference, audioconference or other remote  business practices, such as online meetings, have been carefully reviewed, were found  not to be effective and that travel is therefore necessary.  3.3 Travel arrangements for all United Nations travellers should be finalized 16  calendar days before the commencement of official travel (the advance purchase  policy). Compliance with the advance purchase policy is regulated as follows:    (a)  Travellers are requested to submit their travel request a minimum of 21  calendar days before the commencement of official travel;     (b)  In the case of home leave, family visit and education grant travel, failure  of staff members to submit their travel request a minimum of 21 calendar days in  advance of travel will disqualify the staff members, regardless of their level, from  requesting that the Organization purchase the tickets for such travel. The staff  members will only be eligible to receive a lump sum;    (c)  In the case of other types of official travel, where the traveller is entitled  to travel above economy class under normally applicable rules, a prerequisite for  undertaking travel above economy class for all United Nations travellers, except at  the level of Assistant Secretary-General and above (and eligible family members), is  the submission of their travel request a minimum of 21 calendar days in advance of  travel, subject to the following:    (i)  In situations where travel documents are delayed and the travel request has  not been submitted a minimum of 21 calendar days in advance of travel, the  head of entity has discretionary authority to approve travel above economy  class. Such approval must be recorded in Umoja for accurate reporting to the  General Assembly;    (ii) In events such as critical incidents or natural disasters, unforeseen  circumstances, late invitations from Member States, emergencies or other  immediate or urgent operational requirements necessitating immediate travel  and therefore resulting in non-compliance with the advance purchase policy, the  head of entity has discretionary authority to approve travel above economy  class. Such approval must be recorded in Umoja for accurate reporting to the  General Assembly.  3.4 Official travel for senior officials is further regulated as follows:    ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1    3/11  24-09646      (a)  Official travel by senior officials at the Under-Secretary-General level, by  senior officials reporting directly to the Secretary-General and by heads of mission in  the field shall be recorded in Umoja through the employee self-service portal;    (b)  Wherever feasible, Under-Secretaries-General and heads of mission shall  inform the local United Nations office or mission of their presence;    (c)  To the extent possible, senior officials should avoid attending the same  event;    (d)  Travel undertaken by senior officials at the Assistant Secretary-General  level shall be authorized by their respective heads of entity.        Travel provisions relating to the policy on breast-feeding    3.5 Pursuant to section 3 of Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2019/1, staff  members who are nursing mothers with an infant under one year of age may elect to  have the infant travel with them on official business travel, except when the staff  member travels to a non-family duty station.  3.6 When the travel of an infant is permitted, in addition to the travel expenses  authorized for the mother, the Organization shall pay for the infant:    (a)  10 per cent of the cost of the mother's ticket, including taxes and  surcharges;     (b)  10 per cent of the applicable daily subsistence allowance.  3.7 Further to the provisions of section 3.6 above, no travel expenses shall be paid  on account of the infant's caretakers.        Medical and security clearance    3.8 In accordance with administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/4, entitled ""Medical  clearances"", candidates and staff members authorized to travel at the Organization's  expense on travel on initial appointment, re-employment, assignment or transfer are  required to receive the necessary medical clearance in order to ensure that they are fit  to travel. After recruitment, and in accordance with the provisions of the  administrative instruction, medical clearance is required to ensure that the staff  member continues to maintain a level of fitness that enables him or her to perform the  functions assigned when on travel status.  3.9 All United Nations travellers are required to obtain the necessary security  clearance required for their travel. In this connection, all travellers are to visit the  website of the Department of Safety and Security for more details on how to manage  their trips and obtain security clearance.2   3.10 A prerequisite for undertaking official travel is the successful completion of all  required security training, including the course on basic security in the field for all  official travel and the course on advanced security in the field for official travel to  any field location. No travel should be authorized without the successful completion  of those courses, as applicable.  __________________    2  See https://trip.dss.un.org.

This provision shall not apply to staff members  travelling as instructors, whose travel accommodation shall be determined in  accordance with section 4.3 (c);    (e)  When official business travel is combined with home leave or family visit  travel, the provisions of sections 4.3 (c) and 12 do not apply.

In instances where an escort (a staff member or an eligible family member) is  authorized to accompany a medical evacuee, the standard of travel accommodation  for the escort shall be determined on the basis of the standard of travel  accommodation of the evacuee. A standard of accommodation for air travel higher  than that authorized above may be approved on an exceptional basis in accordance  with sections 4.8 and 4.9 below.  4.4 Where possible, staff members are encouraged to voluntarily downgrade their  entitlement from the class immediately below first class to premium economy cabins  __________________    3  See ST/SGB/2009/9.    ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1    5/11  24-09646    or premium seats, without restriction to the least costly economy service. The  provisions of section 7 below shall also apply.  4.5 When travel is authorized for consultants and individual contractors, economy  class shall be the standard of accommodation for air travel in all cases irrespective of  the duration of the journey, unless determined otherwise by the Secretary-General,  taking into account the circumstances of the traveller (such as for health reasons) and  the interests of the Organization as provided in sections 4.8 and 4.9 below.  4.6 Air travel accommodation under the applicable standards defined in section 4.3  above shall be provided in accordance with section 4.2, including discounted airfares.  The Organization shall assume responsibility for the surcharge that may be imposed  after tickets have been issued if changes in the original travel plans were necessitated  by the Organization or for other compelling reasons. However, where the normal  standard of accommodation is unavailable and the cost of daily subsistence allowance  while waiting for the next available seat would be greater than the additional cost of  the higher standard of travel, an upgrade in travel accommodation is allowable.  4.7 For official travel to missions or conferences, special arrangements may be  made for group travel, in which case the provisions of section 4.3 (a) to (f) may not  apply.  4.8 A standard of accommodation for air travel higher than that authorized under  normally applicable rules may be approved on an exceptional basis when, in the  opinion of the Secretary-General, special circumstances warrant it, such as for duly  certified medical reasons. Requests for all exceptions shall be submitted in writing to  the Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance well  in advance of travel. Such requests shall also be made using form TTS.3.  4.9 Pursuant to section 4.8, in support of the request for an exception on medical  grounds, a medical report and any supporting documentation should be submitted  directly to the Director of the Health-Care Management and Occupational Safety and  Health Division in New York, indicating what specific negative medical outcome will  be prevented by travel in a higher class. The supporting medical report should indicate  the reasons why the conditions of travel in the normally authorized standard of travel  accommodation cannot be medically tolerated, as compared to the conditions of a  normal working day.        Section 5      Travel time other than on home leave or family visit        Travel time by the normal mode    5.1 Pursuant to section 4.2, in determining the duration of a journey, either by air or  by the fastest available surface mode of transportation when air travel is not feasible,  actual travel time spent during a working day shall not be charged to annual leave.

Travel time by other than the normal mode    5.3 Staff members travelling for all or part of a journey by a route other than the  approved route, or wholly or in part by surface when air transportation is the normal  mode, or by other than the fastest available surface means of transportation when air  travel is not feasible or cost-effective, shall be granted travel time not chargeable to  ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1      24-09646  6/11    annual leave only for the time that would have been required had the travel been  undertaken by the approved route and normal mode.        Rest periods    5.4 Rest periods for travel by air shall be limited to staff travelling in economy class.  In this respect, staff members shall be granted rest periods before commencing duties  if the scheduled time for the journey in economy class is more than six hours. In such  cases, the staff member shall not normally be required to commence duty within 12  hours of arriving at the destination.  5.5 In computing the scheduled time under section 5.4, a maximum of two hours  shall be counted for each necessary waiting period between connecting flights.  5.6 Staff members who travel at the class immediately below first class are expected  to report to duty within a reasonable time (i.e. four hours) upon arriving at a given  destination.        Staff members attending consecutive meetings    5.7 Staff members who are required to attend consecutive meetings in different duty  stations in close proximity, or in the same duty station, pending the commencement  of the second meeting, may remain in either of the two duty stations, which would  normally be the duty station with the lower daily subsistence allowance rate, while  taking into consideration any security-related issues and the preparatory needs of the  next meeting. The staff member may remain on official travel status during the  intervening days if there is a maximum of three calendar days between meetings. The  decision on whether a staff member may remain on official travel status will be based  on the welfare and health of the staff member, the related cost savings and any  security-related concerns. Staff shall be expected to work remotely where possible  for any intervening days authorized between meetings.        Section 6      Travel time on home leave or family visit    6.1 For travel undertaken during a working day on both the outward and the return  journey on home leave or family visit, including under the lump-sum option set out  in section 12 below, staff members shall be granted a fixed amount of travel time not  chargeable to annual leave, based on the approved route as follows:    (a)  One day for each journey of 11 hours or less;    (b)  A maximum of two days for each journey of more than 11 hours.    In computing the duration of a journey for the purpose of travel time, each  necessary waiting period between connecting flights shall be counted. No travel time  shall be granted for travel undertaken on a weekend or official holiday at the duty  station of the staff member.  6.2 There shall be no entitlement to subsistence allowance for travel time.        Section 7      Deviations for personal convenience from the approved route, mode of  transportation or standard of accommodation    7.1 Pursuant to staff rule 7.3 (k) (iii), when staff members or their eligible family  members are permitted to travel for their personal convenience by a more economical  route, mode of transportation or standard of accommodation than the approved  standard for the authorized destination as determined in line with section 4.2, their    ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1    7/11  24-09646    entitlement in respect of a particular journey shall be limited to the actual route, mode  of transportation or standard of accommodation used at the rate paid by the traveller.   7.2. Further to section 7.1, the use of a more economical fare shall not entitle the  staff member to apply savings to any deviation from the approved itinerary or to  stopovers or further transportation. The staff member shall be responsible for any  delays, penalties or additional expenses incurred as a result of taking a lower fare or  making special arrangements, including deviations for personal convenience.        Section 8      Reimbursement for travel by private motor vehicle    8.1 Pursuant to staff rule 7.4, staff members may be authorized to travel by private  motor vehicle. Such authorization must be made in writing prior to the  commencement of travel.  8.2 In instances where the Organization provides authorization for travel by a  private motor vehicle, the total reimbursable amount that a staff member may claim  in respect of a particular journey shall be limited to the maximum travel expenses to  which the staff member would have been entitled had he or she and his or her eligible  family members, if any, travelled by the approved route and mode of transportation  and standard of accommodation.  8.3 The maximum travel expenses for this purpose shall be limited to and calculated  on the basis of:    (a)  The cost of the most economical airfare, including charges for  accompanied excess baggage if applicable;     (b)  When air travel is not feasible, the cost of travel by the fastest available  surface mode of transportation using the appropriate standard of accommodation as  determined in the present administrative instruction.        Reimbursable expenses    8.4 Subject to presentation of relevant proof, reimbursement of expenses related to  the authorized travel by privately owned vehicle may include:    (a)  Operating costs on the basis of total vehicle mileage by the most  economical route, as shown in official road guides, at established rates applicable to  the area in which travel is undertaken;    (b)  Road, bridge or tunnel tolls;    (c)  Where the journey requires that a portion of travel be by train, a vehicular  roll-on/roll-off ferry or a ship, or a combination of these modes of transportation,  reimbursable expenses shall be limited to port charges and the cost of passage for  both the vehicle and the authorized passengers;    (d)  Extra expenses incurred for transportation of accompanied excess  baggage, if applicable.        Travel of more than one United Nations traveller in the same vehicle    8.5 In case of travel by more than one United Nations traveller in the same vehicle,  only one of the travellers is entitled to claim reimbursement for the expenses under  section 8.4 (a), (b) and (d).

Travel for personal convenience    8.7 Those authorized to travel under the provisions of the present instruction who  elect to travel by private motor vehicle for personal convenience should obtain prior  authorization from the appropriate executive or administrative officer or, where  applicable, the local human resources management office, by submitting a written  request indicating, among other things, the purpose of travel, the planned itinerary  and the names of accompanying family members or colleagues. As with all other  travel claims, request for reimbursement of travel expenses (other than mileage) must  be supported by proper receipts and ticket stubs.  8.8 Pursuant to appendix D to the Staff Rules, compensation in the event of death,  injury or illness shall not be payable in the case of private motor vehicle transportation  sanctioned or authorized by the United Nations solely at the request and for the  convenience of the staff member. In accordance with General Assembly resolution 22  E (I) and staff rule 1.8, staff members who own or drive motor cars are required to  carry public liability and property damage insurance in an amount adequate to insure  them against claims arising from injury or death to other persons or from damage to  the property of others caused by their cars.        Rates of reimbursement    8.9 The rates of reimbursement indicated in section 8.4 (a) above, which are  applicable to different groups of countries and territories, shall be updated from time  to time on the basis of changes in the operating costs in the area concerned. Changes  in rates shall be communicated to the staff by means of information circular.        Section 9      Terminal expenses    9.1 In accordance with staff rule 7.6, terminal expenses incurred for each required  trip between the airport or other point of arrival or departure and the hotel or other  place of dwelling shall be paid in a fixed amount in respect of the staff member and,  where applicable, each eligible family member authorized to travel at United Nations  expense. Such fixed amounts, and any reduction applicable when official United  Nations, government or any other type of transport is made available for the trip, shall  be set out in the information circular on official travel issued by the Under-Secretary- General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance.  9.2 No terminal expenses shall be paid in respect of:    (a)  An intermediate stop that is not authorized;    (b)  An intermediate forced connection of less than six hours that does not  involve leaving the terminal or is exclusively for the purpose of making an onward  connection;    (c)  Travel using the lump-sum option;     (d)  Travel by privately owned motor vehicle.  9.3 Terminal expenses paid in accordance with section 9.1 shall be deemed to cover  all expenses for transportation between the airport or other point of arrival or    ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1    9/11  24-09646    departure and the hotel or other place of dwelling, including transfer of baggage and  other related incidental charges.  9.4 Claims for payment of terminal expenses shall be made in accordance with the  provisions of section 13 below.        Section 10      Miscellaneous travel expenses       In accordance with staff rule 7.8, expenses that are deemed necessary and  incurred by a staff member while on official travel status may be reimbursed by the  Organization after the completion of travel, provided that the necessity and nature of  the expenses are satisfactorily explained and supported by proper receipts, which  shall normally be required for any expenditures in excess of $30. Non-receipted  expenses under $30 may be reimbursed where authorized. Such expenses, for which  advance authorization shall be obtained to the extent practicable, shall normally be  limited to:    (a)  Local transportation other than that provided for under staff rule 7.6 and  section 9 above;    (b)  Telephone and other forms of communication required for official  business;    (c)  Space, equipment and services required for official use;    (d)  Transportation or storage of authorized baggage or property used for  conducting official business;    (e)  Baggage fees charged by airlines, equivalent to the charge for one checked  bag up to 23 kg, when no free baggage allowance is offered by a particular airline;     (f)  Passport fees for locally recruited staff members required to travel on  official business on behalf of the Organization;     (g)  Visa fees for official travel.

No advance payment shall be made in respect of miscellaneous travel expenses  under staff rule 7.8 and section 10 above.  11.2 No travel advance payment shall be made for travel on separation from service.  11.3 An advance of up to 75 per cent of the estimated subsistence allowance may be  made to individuals who are not staff members, such as consultants, individual  contractors or members of committees.    ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1      24-09646  10/11        Section 12      Lump-sum option for travel on home leave or family visit or education  grant travel    12.1 For travel on home leave or family visit or education grant travel, staff members  may opt for a lump sum.  12.2 For travel by air, including where there is a combination of other modes of  transportation involving the purchase of a ticket (e.g. ferry, ship or train), the lump  sum payable under this section shall amount to 70 per cent of the cost of the least  restrictive economy class ticket, as determined in accordance with section 4.2 above,  by the least costly scheduled air carrier between the staff member's duty station and:    (a)  The closest airport to the established place of entitlement for home leave  or family visit travel or an approved alternate, whichever is the less costly;     (b)  The established place of home leave or the educational institution,  whichever is less costly, for education grant travel.    For children entitled to reduced-fare tickets, the lump sum shall be 70 per cent  of the cost of the least restrictive reduced economy class ticket, provided that the  ticket would allow the child to occupy a seat on the approved mode of transportation.  12.3 For travel by car, the lump sum payable under this section shall amount to 20 per  cent of the cost of the least restrictive economy class ticket, by the least costly  scheduled air carrier, per authorized household member in the car, as determined in  line with section 4.2.  12.4 By selecting the lump-sum option, a staff member agrees to waive all  entitlements relating to home leave, family visit or education grant travel that would  otherwise have been payable by the Organization, except travel time as provided  under section 6.1 above. No additional payment shall be made once the option has  been exercised.  12.5 Utilization of the lump-sum option shall not affect compensation under  appendix D to the Staff Rules, provided that the travel is, in line with section 4.2,  between the staff member's duty station and the established place of home leave or  authorized place of family visit travel, as applicable.  12.6 The lump-sum option shall not be available on a partial basis. It must cover both  the outward and the return journeys for home leave, family visit or education grant  travel and all travel related to a particular home leave by the staff member and his or  her eligible family members, even when separate home leave travel has been  authorized. However, when a staff member's home leave travel is combined with  travel on official business, the staff member may exercise the option in respect of his  or her eligible family members.  12.7 Once the lump-sum option has been selected, it shall not be possible to revert to  the normal travel entitlement for the specific travel.   12.8 Pursuant to section 3.1 above, there shall be no retroactive reimbursement of  travel cost through the lump-sum option mechanism unless a written request was  made and approved prior to the commencement of the journey. In this connection,  any retroactive reimbursement of travel costs shall be limited to the actual cost of the  air ticket(s) not exceeding the maximum travel expenses to which the staff member  would have otherwise been entitled had he or she and his or her eligible family  members, if any, travelled at the direct expense of the Organization through the  approved route and mode of transportation.    ST/AI/2013/3/Rev.1    11/11  24-09646    12.9 The Organization shall not be responsible for delays or additional expenses that may  be incurred or liabilities that may arise as a result of the exercise of the lump-sum option.  It is the staff member's responsibility to take out appropriate travel cancellation insurance.  However, when the exigencies of service make it imperative for the staff member to  postpone the home leave or family visit travel for which the lump sum was paid, the  Organization shall assume responsibility for surcharges or fees that may be imposed as a  result of the ticket changes, but not for any fare increase.  12.10 Staff members who wish to obtain the information necessary for them to  decide whether to exercise the lump-sum option shall so inform their executive or  administrative office, which will proceed in accordance with the procedures set out  in the information circular on official travel issued by the Under-Secretary-General  for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and ensure that the staff member  requests the lump-sum option in Umoja.        Section 13      Travel claims        General    13.1 Staff members shall, within two calendar weeks after completion of travel,  submit an expense report in Umoja. Staff members shall be required to retain the  original travel documentation, such as used airline tickets, boarding passes and hotel  receipts, for a period of five years, and must be ready to provide the documentation  in the original form at any time, upon request, for audit and monitoring purposes.  Failure to do so will result in immediate recovery of the travel expenses, including  lump-sum payments and the daily subsistence allowance payments, where applicable.  13.2 Recovery of travel advances through payroll deduction shall be initiated if a  staff member fails to submit an expense report in Umoja, together with the supporting  documentation, within two calendar weeks after completion of travel.  13.3 If, on review of the claim, it is determined that the travel advance exceeded the  amount of reimbursable travel expenses, the staff member shall be informed of the  amount of overpayment, which shall be recovered through payroll deduction.        Travel under the lump-sum option    13.4 Staff members having selected the lump-sum option in section 12 shall, within  two calendar weeks after completion of travel, submit an expense report in Umoja.  13.5 The entire amount of the lump sum shall be recovered through payroll deduction  if the staff member fails to comply with the terms and conditions of utilizing the lump- sum option as authorized, including but not limited to failure to submit an expense  report in Umoja within two calendar weeks after completion of travel.        Section 14      Final provisions    14.1 The present administrative instruction shall enter into force on 1 July 2024.   14.2 Administrative  instructions  ST/AI/2013/3,  ST/AI/2013/3/Amend.3  and  ST/AI/2013/3/Amend.4 are hereby superseded.

The policy does not apply to  separately administered funds and programmes which are responsible for establishing  their own policies on the subject. It does not apply to peacekeeping operations or to  technical assistance projects, for which separate policies are in effect.  1.2 The policy also does not apply to the provision and use of vehicles other than  passenger cars, station wagons, minivans or sport utility vehicles, since the need for  such other vehicles and the conditions of their use will be clearly dictated by  circumstances at the respective duty stations.         Section 2      General policy governing the use of official cars     2.1 The general policy governing the use of official cars is as follows:    (a)  Only the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General are provided  with a car for their exclusive use;    (b)  At the principal United Nations locations other than New York, Geneva  and Vienna, the heads of the respective offices may each be assigned a car on a full- time basis. The use of the assigned vehicle should be for official business and for  transportation to and from work; when this vehicle is not required by the head of  office, it should be made available for other official requirements;    (c)  All other cars will be considered as part of a pool, available for all  operational functions of the office concerned. Heads of offices and programmes in  Geneva and Vienna may be assigned a car from the pool for official business and for  transportation to and from work;     2      ST/AI/2006/1      (d)  Requests for exceptions to the general policy on the use of official cars  based on reasons of health, security or other location-specific factors should be  forwarded for consideration to the Under-Secretary-General for Management.   2.2 Once the need for an official car has been determined on the basis of section 3.1  below, its use will be restricted to the purpose which was indicated at the time the  approval was given.         Section 3      Provision of cars for official use            Purchase of cars    3.1 The decision of whether to purchase a car for the use of an office will be  determined by criteria related to the transportation needs of the office and the approval  of budgetary resources for that purpose. In that regard, a major factor will be the  availability of public transportation locally, including taxis. Circumstances tending to  support the provision of official cars would include an extensive need for local travel  during working hours, inadequate public transport availability, particularly between  the office and the airport, the unavailability of cars for hire when required or  operational needs that would require frequent use of cargo-carrying and/or multi- purpose (passenger-cargo) vehicles.         Replacement of existing vehicles    3.2 Replacement of existing undamaged vehicles used primarily in urban areas shall  be considered after the vehicle has been in use for five years or driven 128,000  kilometres (80,000 miles), whichever comes first.         Section 4      Implementation       Except as provided in section 2.1 (d) above, the Assistant Secretary-General for  Central Support Services at Headquarters, the Director-General of the United Nations  Office at Geneva, the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna, the  Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, the Executive  Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme and the executive  secretaries of the regional commissions for Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and  the Caribbean, Africa and Western Asia are responsible for the implementation of the  present instruction in respect of the use of vehicles for their respective duty stations or  offices.         Section 5      Final provisions     5.1 The present policy whereby staff members may be reimbursed by the  Organization for duly authorized official use of personal cars, as provided under  administrative instruction ST/AI/1998/2, remains unaltered.       3      ST/AI/2006/1 5.2 Administrative instruction ST/AI/337 is hereby abolished.  5.3 The present instruction shall enter into force on 1 August 2006.

The Secretariat has received from the United States Mission to the United Nations a note verbale dated 15 July 2004 in which it informs the Secretariat of the proper procedures to be followed regarding citations for motor vehicle infractions. 2. The text of the note verbale is set out in the annex to the present circular. * The present circular will be in effect until further notice. 2 ST/IC/2004/39 Annex Note verbale dated 15 July 2004 from the United States Mission to the United Nations The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the permanent missions and observer offices to the United Nations and the United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to inform of the proper procedures to be followed regarding citations for motor vehicle infractions. In accordance with international law, and without prejudice to properly accorded immunities, it is the obligation of the diplomatic community to respect and comply with laws and regulations of the United States. Traffic citations constitute notice that the recipient has not complied with local traffic laws and regulations. A fine is generally attached to the citation, payment of which is in accordance with the duty to comply with the law. Valid issuance of a traffic citation is not considered a violation of the immunities to which members of the permanent missions, some observer offices and certain officials of the United Nations may be entitled. In accordance with past practice, the United States Mission will not intervene with local jurisdictions to request dismissal of valid moving violations and all other non- parking citations. Prompt payment of all fines associated with such citations is expected. If members of the missions or United Nations officials wish to contest the facts forming the basis for the issuance of a particular traffic citation, they should bring the matter to the attention of the United States Mission, which will provide appropriate guidance. The United States Mission recommends that traffic citations incurred by members of the United Nations community be given immediate attention. Fines should be paid or contested within the time period mentioned in the citation. Members of the diplomatic community who enjoy immunity will not be required to appear in judicial proceedings or otherwise to submit personally to the civil or administrative jurisdiction of the United States. Non-diplomatic personnel may, as in the past, be obliged to appear in judicial or administrative hearings to establish the facts in order to invoke an official acts immunity defence. Members of the diplomatic community are reminded, however, that immunity from jurisdiction does not imply that the United States is obliged to continue to honour the privilege to operate a motor vehicle if the privilege is demonstrably abused. The United States Mission wishes to express its appreciation to the United Nations Secretariat and permanent missions and observer offices to the United Nations for their cooperation in the attempt to reduce traffic violations incurred by members of the diplomatic community.

Section 2      Scope of application    2.1 The use of taxis and other for-hire vehicles between Headquarters in New York  and the local destination may be authorized during regular working hours in  connection with the performance of official duties if:     (a)  Public transportation is not available; or     (b)  It is more expedient to travel by taxi and other for-hire vehicles, because  of the distance or timing.  2.2 The use of taxis and other for-hire vehicles, as described in section 3.2 below,  may be authorized for those who begin or end their shift between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.  provided that such staff members:    (a)  Do not have parking permits in the United Nations garage; and    (b)  Do not regularly begin or end their shift between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.   2.3 Staff members should obtain prior authorization from the applicable Executive  or Administrative Officer before using taxis and other for-hire vehicles in connection  with the performance of official duties. If obtaining prior authorization is not possible,  the authorization should be requested no more than two working days after the use of  such transportation.  2.4 Whenever local transportation is required in connection with the performance  of official duties, public transportation should be used to the extent possible.   ST/AI/2020/2      20-09467  2/2    2.5 Whenever possible, staff members leaving Headquarters buildings around the  same time and going in the same general direction should arrange to form a taxi pool,  thus reducing the costs to the Organization. Staff members should exercise the same  care in incurring taxi expenses that a prudent and cost-conscious person would  exercise if travelling on personal business.        Section 3      Reimbursement    3.1 For circumstances described in section 2.1, the total cost of taxi and other for- hire-vehicle fares incurred will be reimbursed.   3.2 For circumstances described in section 2.2, the reimbursement will include:     (a)  For staff members who live anywhere in the five boroughs of New York  City, taxi and other for-hire-vehicle fares from Headquarters to the staff member's  residence;    (b)  For staff members who live outside the five boroughs of New York City,  (i) taxi and other for-hire-vehicle fares from Headquarters to the nearest rail or bus  station, and (ii) taxi and other for-hire-vehicle fares from the rail or bus station of  their destination closest to the staff member's residence to the residence. In cases  where, because of the late hour, the use of public transportation is no longer feasible  or will present a safety hazard to the staff members concerned, reimbursement may  be made for taxi and other for-hire-vehicle fares from Headquarters to the staff  member's residence.   3.3 In case of extremely inclement weather, such as those occasions when staff  members are permitted to leave early subject to exigencies of service, the United  Nations will reimburse the cost of bed and breakfast at a nearby hotel for those staff  members who are required to work after 11 p.m. and who, because of the weather  conditions, are unable to return home for the night. This provision does not apply to  staff members working on night shifts on a regular basis.  3.4 Reimbursement of (a) fares for taxis and other for-hire vehicles or (b) hotel  expenses in accordance with section 3.3 will be made against presentation of a receipt  or another similar proof of expenditure through the completion of the F.10-E form  signed by both the staff members concerned and the applicable Executive or  Administrative Officer.         Section 4      Compensation for death, injury or illness    4.1 Staff members using taxis and other for-hire vehicles in connection with the  performance of official duties may be entitled to compensation in accordance with  appendix D to the Staff Rules.        Section 5      Final provisions    5.1 The present administrative instruction shall enter into force on the date of its  issuance.  5.2 Administrative instructions ST/AI/248 dated 7 July 1977 and ST/AI/248/Amend.1  dated 27 June 1980 are hereby superseded.

Section 2      Eligibility    2.1 Pursuant to annex IV to the Staff Regulations and staff rule 3.19, former staff  members who were internationally recruited shall be eligible for payment of the  repatriation grant when the following conditions are met at the time of separation of  the staff member:     (a)  The Organization has the obligation to repatriate the staff member after  five years or longer of qualifying service, as defined in section 3 of the present  instruction;     (b)  The staff member resides outside his or her home country and country of  nationality, as defined by staff rule 3.19, while serving at the last duty station;     (c)  The staff member has not been dismissed or separated from service for  abandonment of post.   2.2 No repatriation grant shall be paid to:    (a)  A staff member locally recruited under staff rule 4.4;     (b)  A staff member who has permanent residence status in the country of the  duty station at the time of separation.

If a former staff member is re-employed under staff rule 4.17, a new  period of qualifying service shall begin upon his or her re-employment. Qualifying  service shall be considered to remain continuous during periods of special leave.  However, service credits for purposes of computation of the grant shall not accrue  during periods of special leave with partial pay or without pay of one full month or  longer.   3.3 When qualifying service outside the home country and the country of  nationality or country of permanent residence has been interrupted by service within  one of those countries, qualifying service credits towards the repatriation grant shall  be counted as follows:     (a)  Qualifying service credits towards the repatriation grant shall be reduced  by twice the number of completed years and months of non-qualifying service  within the home country, or the country of nationality, or country of permanent  residence;     (b)  After reassignment to a duty station outside the home country and the  country of nationality, or country of permanent residence, qualifying service credits  towards the repatriation grant shall be restored at twice the normal rate until such  time as the service credits reduced by virtue of paragraph (a) above have been  restored. Thereafter, qualifying service credits shall accrue at the normal rate until  the maximum of 12 years is reached, pursuant to annex IV to the Staff Regulations.   3.4 Qualifying service credits for staff members who have been exceptionally  authorized to acquire or maintain permanent resident status in the country of their  duty station and subsequently change that status shall begin to accrue from the time  such change was made, provided that all other requirements are satisfied.        Section 4      Evidence of relocation    4.1 Pursuant to staff rule 3.19 (d), payment of the repatriation grant after  separation from service of an eligible staff member shall require prior submission of  documentary evidence satisfactory to the Secretary-General that the former staff  member has relocated away from the country of the last duty station.2  __________________    1  In accordance with staff rule 13.1 (a), all permanent appointments shall be governed by the terms  and conditions applicable to continuing appointments under the Staff Regulations and the Staff  Rules, except as provided otherwise under the same staff rule (13.1 (a)).    2  Repatriation grant with respect to qualifying service rendered before 1 July 1979 shall be paid to  former staff members who meet the conditions of eligibility set out in staff rule 3.19 (c), without  evidence of relocation away from the country of the last duty station.    ST/AI/2016/2    3/4  16-11039    4.2 The requirement of section 4.1 above shall normally be satisfied by  submission of a sworn statement made by the former staff member before a Notary  Public, Commissioner of Oaths or similar official in the country of relocation to the  effect that the former staff member has relocated to a country other than that of the  last duty station, and that the relocation is not temporary in nature. The statement  shall also include the date and place of relocation, and the address and telephone  number of the former staff member in the country of relocation. The statement must  be submitted as an original document.        Section 5      Amount and computation of the grant    5.1 After the minimum period of qualifying service of five years has been  completed, the repatriation grant shall be calculated at the rates specified in  annex IV to the Staff Regulations and on the basis of the number of completed years  and months of continuous qualifying service counted in accordance with section 2  of the present instruction.  5.2 Payment of the repatriation grant shall be calculated as follows:     (a)  For staff in the Professional and higher categories, on the basis of the  staff member's gross salary at the time of separation, less staff assessment according  to the schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (i);     (b)  For staff in the Field Service category, on the basis of the staff member's  gross salary at the time of separation, less staff assessment according to the  schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (i), plus language allowance, if  any;     (c)  For staff in the General Service and related categories, on the basis of the  staff member's gross salary, including language allowance, if any, and  non-resident's allowance in respect of staff entitled to payment of such allowance  under staff rule 13.8, less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set  forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (ii) applied to the gross salary alone.   5.3 Where both spouses are staff members and each is entitled, on separation, to  payment of a repatriation grant, and taking into account staff rule 4.7, payment shall  be made to each, at the rate for a staff member with neither a spouse nor a  dependent child at the time of separation, according to their respective entitlements.  Where dependent children are recognized, the first parent to be separated may claim  payment at the rate applicable to a staff member with a spouse or dependent child.  In this event, the second parent may, on separation, claim payment at the rate for a  staff member with neither a spouse nor a dependent child at the time of separation  for the whole period of qualifying service. Alternatively, if eligible, the second  parent may claim payment at the rate for a staff member with a spouse or dependent  child for the whole period of qualifying service, from which shall be deducted the  difference between the rate for a staff member with a spouse or dependent child and  the rate for a staff member with neither a spouse nor a dependent child of the  repatriation grant paid to the first parent.   5.4 The amount of the grant shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of  staff rule 4.17 (c) for staff members appointed by the United Nations within  12 months of separation from any other organization of the United Nations common  system.

The statement shall also include the date and place of  relocation, and the address and telephone number of the survivors in the country of  relocation. The statement must be submitted as an original document.   6.3 If there is one such survivor, payment shall be made at the rate for a staff  member with neither a spouse nor a dependent child at the time of separation; if  there are two or more such survivors, payment shall be made at the rate applicable  to a staff member with a spouse or dependent child.        Section 7      Time limitation for submission of claims    7.1 Pursuant to staff rule 3.19, entitlement to a repatriation grant shall cease if no  claim, with evidence of relocation as defined by sections 4.2 or 6.2 above, has been  submitted within two years after the effective date of separation. 2  7.2 However, when both spouses are employed by the Organization and the spouse  who separates first is entitled to a repatriation grant, the claim for payment of the  grant by that spouse shall be considered receivable if made within two years of the  date of separation of the other spouse.2        Section 8      Final provisions    8.1 As a transitional measure, a staff member who was eligible for a repatriation  grant under staff rule 3.19 and ST/AI/2000/5 in effect on 30 June 2016, but who is  no longer eligible for such a grant under the present instruction, shall be paid a  repatriation grant in accordance with the schedule set out in annex IV to the Staff  Regulations in effect on 30 June 2016 for the number of years of qualifying service  accrued as at 30 June 2016.  8.2 The present administrative instruction shall enter into force on 1 July 2016.   8.3 Administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/5 is hereby abolished.

Rest and recuperation is a  means by which staff members may take regular authorized time outside the duty  station approved for rest and recuperation to be given a break from the dangerous,  stressful and difficult working and living conditions under which they serve. Rest and  recuperation is not an additional annual leave entitlement or financial compensation  for the degree of hardship and insecurity of a duty station.  1.2 The authorized time off for rest and recuperation shall consist of five  consecutive calendar days not charged to annual leave, plus actual travel time. 1 To  ensure that the purpose set out in section 1.1 above is achieved, rest and recuperation  shall be granted once the conditions set out in section 3 below have been met.        Eligibility    1.3 The following individuals shall be eligible for rest and recuperation:   __________________    1  Travel time is granted to enable travel between the duty station and the designated rest and  recuperation destination. It is determined on the basis of the actual time that staff members are  expected to spend travelling from the place of duty to the designated rest and recuperation  location by the fastest means and most direct route. Staff members may avail themselves of rest  and recuperation at a destination other than the designated rest and recuperation destination.  Irrespective of the destination where they avail themselves of rest and recuperation, the travel  time granted is that which has been approved for travel to and from the duty station and the rest  and recuperation destination.  ST/AI/2018/10      18-18687  2/6      (a)  Internationally recruited staff members appointed, assigned or on travel  status to a duty station approved for rest and recuperation;     (b)  Locally recruited staff members on travel status to the duty station  approved for rest and recuperation, provided the duty station is in a country other than  the country of the parent duty station.  1.4 The benefit of rest and recuperation does not extend to family members.

The approval and the length  of the rest and recuperation cycle may be introduced, adjusted or discontinued  dependent on the prevailing conditions at the duty station.  2.3 Duty stations approved for rest and recuperation, as well as the effective date of  approval and subsequent changes, if any, shall be published by the Assistant  Secretary-General for Human Resources Management in an information circular. 2     `    Effect of change in approval status    2.4 Staff members already present at a duty station newly approved for rest and  recuperation shall begin to accrue qualifying service from the effective date of the  approval. If the rest and recuperation cycle is reduced, staff members may  immediately avail themselves of rest and recuperation on the basis of the new rest and  recuperation cycle, subject to meeting the period of qualifying service. If the rest and  recuperation cycle is lengthened, staff members who had started accruing qualifying  service prior to the effective date of the new cycle may avail themselves of rest and  recuperation after completing the period of qualifying service previously in effect at  the duty station. Upon return of the staff members to the duty station, the new  frequency shall apply.   2.5 In the event that the rest and recuperation benefit is discontinued, staff members  who had started accruing qualifying service prior to the effective date of the  discontinuance may avail themselves of rest and recuperation after completing the  period of qualifying service previously in effect at the duty station.

Qualifying service is the presence of a staff  member at the duty station for the period corresponding to the rest and recuperation  cycle authorized for that duty station, subject to the provisions below.  3.2 Rest and recuperation shall not be granted during the last 30 calendar days of a  staff member's service. Staff members are required to reimburse the full cost of the  most recent rest and recuperation travel unless they serve at their duty stations for a  minimum of 30 calendar days upon return from rest and recuperation. Staff members  shall not be required to reimburse the Organization if:    (a)  They are transferred to another duty station that is approved for rest and  recuperation;     (b)  The non-observance of the 30-day requirement is at the request of the  Organization, as determined by the head of office or director/chief of mission support.        Qualifying service    3.3 In order to be granted time off for rest and recuperation, qualifying service at a  duty station approved for rest and recuperation must be uninterrupted.   3.4 The period of qualifying service shall run from the date on which staff members  arrive at the duty station or from the date on which they return to the duty station after  an absence on rest and recuperation.   3.5 Qualifying service shall not be interrupted or suspended when:    (a)  Travel outside the duty station on official business, including travel for  training purposes, is to a duty station approved for rest and recuperation;    (b)  There is a transfer or reassignment from one duty station approved for rest  and recuperation to another such duty station, and the staff members do not avail  themselves of leave. In such a case, qualifying service accrued at the first duty station  may be carried forward to calculate the overall qualifying service for rest and  recuperation at the new duty station.  3.6 Qualifying service shall be suspended when travel on official business is to a  duty station that is not approved for rest and recuperation. When qualifying service  has been suspended, the period of qualifying service will resume from the date on  which the staff members return to the duty station approved for rest and recuperation.   3.7 Qualifying service is interrupted when staff members are absent from the duty  station approved for rest and recuperation for more than three consecutive or  cumulative working days on any type of authorized leave, whether taken separately  or in conjunction with official business travel. When qualifying service is interrupted,  any service accrued prior to the interruption shall be forfeited. The accrual of  qualifying service shall commence upon the staff members' return to the duty station  approved for rest and recuperation.

When rest  and recuperation is combined with annual leave or uncertified sick leave for a family- related emergency, the period on annual leave or uncertified sick leave shall  commence after completion of the period for rest and recuperation. When rest and  recuperation is combined with annual leave, any illness occurring during the period  of annual leave shall be subject to the provisions of staff rule 6.2 (e).   3.10 When staff members are permitted to combine rest and recuperation with travel  on official business or other type of authorized absence for their personal  convenience, any additional costs above the authorized entitlement in respect of the  official business travel or other type of authorized absence shall be borne by the staff  member. The Organization shall not be responsible for any additional expenses or  liabilities that may be incurred as a result of combining rest and recuperation with  travel on official business or other type of authorized absence, including any costs  incurred in connection with delays, ticket changes, cancellations or fare increases.  3.11 Rest and recuperation may not be combined with any of the following:    (a)  Travel on home leave, family visit or reverse education grant;    (b)  Maternity leave, paternity leave, uncertified sick leave, except when used  for a family-related emergency, or special leave;    (c)  Travel on departure from the duty station approved for rest and  recuperation at the end of the staff members' appointments or assignments, unless the  staff members are transferred or reassigned to another duty station approved for rest  and recuperation and do not take any leave.   3.12 Should such a combination as detailed above occur after the approval or  commencement of rest and recuperation, all days previously authorized as rest and  recuperation shall be charged to annual leave or other leave, as appropriate.        Timing of rest and recuperation    3.13 Rest and recuperation must be taken within 30 calendar days following  completion of the period of qualifying service and shall be forfeited if the staff  members elect not to take it within the prescribed period. Should exigencies of  service, as determined by the head of office or director/chief of mission support,  prevent the staff members from leaving the duty station for the purpose of rest and  recuperation within that period, rest and recuperation may be taken on an exceptional  basis during the next 30 calendar days. A new period of qualifying service shall begin  upon the staff members' return to the duty station.  3.14 Rest and recuperation may not be taken in advance, carried forward from one  qualifying period to the next or combined with subsequent rest and recuperation periods.  3.15 In exceptional circumstances attributable to exigencies of service, the head of  office or director/chief of mission support may allow an earlier departure of up to a  maximum of seven calendar days before the staff members would have otherwise  satisfied the required qualifying service. In such instances, the qualifying service    ST/AI/2018/10    5/6  18-18687    towards the next rest and recuperation cycle will be extended by the same number of  days as that authorized for the early departure.

This applies to all staff members, irrespective of their level.   4.2 Where United Nations transportation is available, it will be provided free of  charge to transport staff members to and from the designated rest and recuperation  destination. No payment for travel costs will apply.   4.3 Payment of the lump sum is not applicable where:    (a)  United Nations transportation is available at the duty station approved for  rest and recuperation and the staff members opt, for their personal convenience, to  travel on a date on which United Nations transportation is not available; or,    (b)  Rest and recuperation is combined with travel on official business.  4.4 Staff members shall not receive a daily subsistence allowance or terminal  expenses when travelling on or for the duration of their rest and recuperation. This also  applies to the daily subsistence allowance and terminal expenses related to continuation  of travel on rest and recuperation when combined with official business travel.   4.5 Regardless of the destination chosen for travel by staff members, the  Organization's financial responsibility shall be limited to the transportation costs  between the duty station and the designated rest and recuperation destination.

Rest and recuperation is a  means by which staff members may take regular authorized time outside the duty  station approved for rest and recuperation to be given a break from the dangerous,  stressful and difficult working and living conditions under which they serve. Rest and  recuperation is not an additional annual leave entitlement or financial compensation  for the degree of hardship and insecurity of a duty station.  1.2 The authorized time off for rest and recuperation shall consist of five  consecutive calendar days not charged to annual leave, plus actual travel time. 1 To  ensure that the purpose set out in section 1.1 above is achieved, rest and recuperation  shall be granted once the conditions set out in section 3 below have been met.

All eligible applicants in the United Nations Secretariat are encouraged to visit  the following websites to familiarize themselves with the new procedures, which  will become mandatory effective 1 March 2008.    https://ceac.state.gov/agnato    http://evisaforms.state.gov/    http://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/forms/forms_1342.html    http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_2637.html    http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1280.html  3.  The United States Mission strongly recommends that applicants refer to the  photo standards guide, available at http://travel.state.gov/visa/guide/guide_3877.html,  to acquire a photo suitable for this new application prior to completing data entry. It  also lists frequently asked questions regarding this form, which may be useful to  review.  4.  Please note that although the new application system is designed to function  fully online without printing the form, the United States Mission continues to  require the Travel and Transportation Section to endorse form PT.61. After  completing the online form, applicants must print the confirmation page as well as  form PT.61 and submit these documents along with their national passports through  their respective Executive/Administrative Office to the Travel and Transportation  Section for submission to the United States Mission. No action will be taken by the  United States Mission unless it receives the endorsement of the Travel and  Transportation Section.        * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2008/11      08-22441  2    Annex       Note verbale dated 3 January 2008 from the United States Mission  to the United Nations        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations Secretariat and has the honour to refer to its circular note  HC-102-S-07 announcing new procedures concerning the revalidation of visas.    The United Nations Secretariat is advised that the new online DS-1648 visa  application form for A, G and NATO visas will be available, effective 7 January  2008. The United States Mission encourages all eligible applicants at the United  Nations Secretariat to use the online version as soon as possible. The new form will  be mandatory beginning 1 March 2008. In order to access the new application,  please visit any of the following websites:    https://ceac.state.gov/agnato    http://evisaforms.state.gov/    http://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/forms/forms_1342.html    http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_2637.html    http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1280.html    It is strongly recommended that applicants refer to the photo standards guide,  available at http://travel.state.gov/visa/guide/guide_3877.html, to acquire a photo  suitable for this new application prior to completing data entry. The frequently  asked questions regarding this form (see below) also may be useful to review.         Frequently asked questions regarding online DS-1648 for A, G and  NATO visas          Is the new online DS-1648 application going to replace the electronic DS-1648?  Yes, but for several weeks, both options will be available, in order to afford the  opportunity to work out any glitches with the new form before it becomes required  as of 1 March 2008.      Does the new online DS-1648 application require that all valid A1-2, G1-4 and  NATO1-6 visas be renewed now?  No, visas issued using the old form are still valid. Applicants just need to use the  new form when it is time for them to renew.      Are all fields in the online DS-1648 mandatory?  Only those marked ""Optional"" may be left blank. The application will not allow an  applicant to submit a form with any mandatory fields left blank; in this instance, an  error message will return the applicant to the field requiring data entry.      Do I need to complete the ""Tour and Embassy Information"" page if I do not work  at an Embassy?  Yes. Please enter your sponsoring mission, organization, or U.S. military base  information, because this is required for all A, G and NATO visa applicants.    ST/IC/2008/11   3  08-22441        What do I enter for my tour/employment completion date if I used to enter D/S  (duration of status) on the old DS-1648?  Choose a date 5-10 years from the day you are applying, as an indication to issue  maximum validity allowed under reciprocity agreements with your country of  nationality.a      Why is the system saying the phone number I entered is invalid?  Check that you followed the example provided below the entry box, using dashes as  part of the phone number (e.g., 555-555-5555).      What happens if I need to step away in the middle of data entry?  The DS-1648 will ""time out"" after approximately 10 minutes, resulting in a  complete loss of data if the application has not been used during that time.  Therefore, it is advisable to use the ""Save"" button in the bottom centre of each page  to save any data already entered in order to avoid its loss if you need to step away  from the application before completing it. You can then use the ""Import Application  Data"" option on the ""Getting Started"" page to pull up the data you have already  entered and saved.      How do I get a digital photo that will successfully upload to this application?  Please refer to the detailed guidance in the photo quality standards guide for  specifications to bring to a photo lab, guidance for using a digital camera, and  requirements for scanned images.      Why did the edits I made from the review page ""edit"" link not save?  In order for data changes made from the review page links to save, you must use the  buttons at the bottom of each page to navigate, instead of the browser's  back/forward buttons or the buttons along the left of the screen.      What do we do regarding the electronic signature if our mission or organization  usually prepares applications for staff?  There are two main options -- first, you can ask staff to come to your office to  electronically sign the application so you can get them to the right place in the  application and complete the remainder of the process yourself. Second, you can  save the data entered and email the resulting data file, along with the photo, to the  applicant with instructions regarding how to import the data, upload the photo,  review the data, and then electronically sign; using this second approach, the  applicant would complete the final steps of designating the location where the  application is to be submitted and printing the confirmation.      What happens if I notice a mistake after I have printed the confirmation page?  Please make a note of the exact error on the confirmation page to draw it to our  attention.      What do I need to submit once I have completed my online DS-1648?  If the photo uploads correctly, we only need the DS-1648 confirmation page  featuring the embassy or organization seal, current passport (and previous passport,  if it contains the previous visa), and most recent I-94. If submitting the application  at the United States Mission to the United Nations, applicants also need to submit a  __________________    a  Clarification from the Travel and Transportation Section of the United Nations: For United  Nations staff, enter the expiration date of your current appointment. Should you have a  permanent appointment, enter your anticipated retirement date as an indication to issue  maximum validity allowed under reciprocity agreements with your country of nationality.  ST/IC/2008/11      08-22441  4    diplomatic note. If the applicant is a foreign military member, then he/she needs to  submit orders or a letter from the host command. If dependents are applying  separate from the principal alien, please submit a copy of the principal alien's visa  and I-94. Finally, if uploading the photo failed, then the application package needs  to include a standard 2x2 passport photo that meets the non-immigrant visa photo  requirements.      If I use the option on the ""Thank You"" page of creating a family application, can  I modify the data automatically populated by the system?  Yes. If one of the dependents has a different surname or nationality, for example, the  applicant can alter those data on the application before submitting.    "

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff members holding a G-4  visa of a diplomatic note received from the United States Mission to the United  Nations regarding the revised definition of ""immediate family"" for dependent  children.  2.  ""Immediate family"" includes unmarried children, whether by blood or  adoption, who reside regularly in the household of the staff member, provided that  such unmarried children are:    (a)  Under the age of 21;    (b)  Under the age of 23 and in full-time attendance as students at post- secondary educational institutions.  Children who do not meet the requirements above may still qualify as immediate  family under the third category for other individuals, provided that they are  recognized by the Organization as dependants of the staff member as demonstrated  by their eligibility for rights and benefits.  3.  Children who are no longer recognized as immediate family members may be  eligible to apply for another visa classification or seek a change of status to another  non-immigrant status.  4.  The diplomatic note is issued consistent with Department of Homeland  Security regulations. The details of the revised procedures are set out in the annex to  the present circular.            * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.  ST/IC/2017/6      17-01222  2/2    Annex        Diplomatic note dated 9 December 2016 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations and has the honour to inform the latter of the revised definition  of ""immediate family"" for the purposes of A, G and certain NATO visas.     The requirements for unmarried adult sons and daughters age 21 or older were  revised under the regulations at 22 CFR 41.21(a)(3). As amended, ""immediate  family"" no longer includes unmarried sons and daughters of all ages. Immediate  family includes only those unmarried sons and daughters, whether by blood or  adoption, who reside regularly in the household of the principal alien and who are  not members of some other household, provided that such unmarried sons and  daughters are: (a) under the age of 21; or (b) under the age of 23 and in full-time  attendance as students at post-secondary educational institutions. Sons and  daughters who do not meet these requirements may still qualify as immediate family  under the third category for other individuals but must be recognized as dependants  of the principal alien by the sending Government or international organization, as  demonstrated by eligibility for rights and benefits, such as the issuance of a  diplomatic or official passport, or travel or other allowance. An adult son or  daughter who is no longer recognized as an immediate family member may be  eligible to apply for another visa classification or seek a change of status to another  non-immigrant status.    These changes are consistent with Department of Homeland Security  regulations under 8 CFR 214.2(a)(2) and (g)(2).    Consequently, within 60 days of the date of this circular note, the United  Nations Secretariat must inform the United States Mission and apply for change of  status for any immediate family members currently in the United States in A, G or  NATO status who no longer meet the definition of ""immediate family"".

The forms P.320 and P.321 outline the requirements for work permits for  spouses and children, respectively, and can be accessed on iSeek.         * The present circular will be in effect until further notice and should be read in conjunction with  ST/IC/2012/11, ST/IC/2013/17 and ST/IC/2013/31.  ST/IC/2016/11      16-06738  2/3    Annex       Diplomatic note dated 31 March 2016 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations        The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the United Nations and wishes to provide an outline of the policies and procedures  for processing employment authorization for dependants.     Employment authorization may be granted for dependants of G-4 non-immigrant  visa holders for a period of up to three years and are then renewable in accordance with  the provisions of 8 CFR and 214.2(g). Dependants must be at least 16 years of age and  meet the application requirements outlined by United States Citizenship and  Immigration Services (USCIS). Additional detailed information can be found on the  United States Mission's website at http://usun.state.gov/about/6632/6639.    All application packages must include an official note from the United Nations  requesting employment authorization. The package should have a point of contact  for the application along with USCIS Form I-765; two copies of USCIS Form I-566;  a copy of the applicant's and principal's passport and visa; a copy of the applicant's  and principal's arrival record (I-94); and two newly taken passport-size photographs  with white background, used only for the application for employment authorization.  The USCIS forms must include original signatures and endorsement by the United  Nations. The passport-style photographs should have been taken within the last  30 days and must not have been used for any other United States Government  document or application.    All applications for dependants of United Nations staff members must include  a job offer letter from a prospective employer. The job offer letter must be written  on official company letterhead, include an original signature or seal from the  employer, and also contain the dependant's name, position, title, description of  duties, hours to be worked, salary to be provided, and verification that the applicant  possesses the qualifications required for the position.    If an applicant is seeking self-employment, a proposal letter outlining the  industry of self-employment, duties to be performed, targeted clientele, hours to be  worked, projected salary, and advertising methods for his/her services is required. In  addition to the self-employment letter, the applicant must include a detailed resume  or curriculum vitae which should include educational background as well as any  certifications and/or licences required for the proposed self-employment.    If the applicant is a student aged 21 or 22, they must be enrolled in an  accredited post-secondary educational programme leading to matriculation, and also  must provide proof of full-time enrolment via an original letter from the college or  university's registrar's office.

When renewing employment authorization documents, please include all items  listed as required for an initial application package, as well as a copy of the expiring  Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and copies of federal and state income    ST/IC/2016/11    3/3  16-06738    taxes filed for the authorized employment period. Applicants are reminded that  G visa holders are considered non-resident aliens for federal tax purposes, and  therefore must file federal tax forms 1040-NR or 1040NR-EZ. If the applicant did  not work during the authorized employment period, the applicant must include a  letter detailing the circumstances for non-employment and a statement confirming  that no income was earned and therefore no taxes were owed during the authorized  employment period.    If an application is missing an item that has been described, it cannot be  processed and will be returned to the United Nations Visa Committee, which will  result in a delayed processing time. Once a completed application is received, it will  be processed and submitted to USCIS in Nebraska. Please note that applications for  employment authorization typically take between six and eight weeks to process.  Processing times may exceed this duration if USCIS has issued a ""Request for  Evidence"", which is a document indicating that an application for employment  authorization requires further attention. Applicants submitting an application for  renewal of an EAD are now eligible to begin the application process 90 days prior  to the expiration of the current EAD.    The United States Mission is unable to provide information on the status of an  application until four weeks after a completed application has been submitted.  Information on the status of the application is not available from USCIS prior to this  time frame. Such inquiries should be directed to USUNYEAD@state.gov and must  contain the applicant's name and personal identification number (PID), the  principal's employer and the date of submission.    "

The purpose of the present circular is to inform staff of the following:     (a)  Diplomatic note dated 9 October 2014 from the United States Mission to  the United Nations regarding revised procedures for obtaining a driver's licence with  a ""motorcycle endorsement"" issued by the Office of Foreign Missions (see annex I);     (b)  Current licensing procedures issued by the United States Office of  Foreign Missions for non-United States citizens in the tri-state area of Connecticut,  New Jersey and New York (see annex II).   2.  The revised procedures concerning the motorcycle endorsement require  motorcycle training/testing in instances in which the applicant's motorcycle  endorsement was issued under foreign standards that are less stringent than standards  applied by states in the United States of America, as determined by the Office of  Foreign Missions. The Secretariat will be notified separately in writing if such a  determination is made. A motorcycle endorsement is required for the operation of a  moped, scooter or motorcycle with an engine size of 49 cm3 and above.   3.  The objective of the revised procedures is to ensure that motorcycle operators  possess the motorcycle safety skills necessary to ensure the safety of the public and  riders. The details of the revised procedures are presented in annex I of the present  circular.   4.  The details of the general licensing procedures issued by the United States  Office of Foreign Missions for Connecticut, New Jersey and New York are set out in  annex II.         * The present circular will be in effect until further notice and supersedes ST/IC/2006/19.  ST/IC/2014/29      14-67560  2/6    Annex I       Diplomatic note dated 9 October 2014 from the United States  Mission to the United Nations         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to  the Secretariat and wishes to inform it that the United States Department of State  has decided, for reasons of public safety, and after conducting extensive research on  the subject, to revise its current policy concerning the testing requirements for  obtaining a Department of State driver's license issued by the Office of Foreign  Missions with a ""motorcycle endorsement"" that permits the licensee to operate a  motorcycle in the United States.     The current policy of the Department of State allows United Nations staff and  their dependants who are eligible for a Department of State driver 's license, and  who hold a valid foreign license with a motorcycle endorsement permitting  operation of a motorcycle with an engine size of 250 cm3 or above, to add a  motorcycle endorsement to the driver's license issued by the Office of Foreign  Missions, with no additional training or testing. The current policy also requires  United Nations staff members and their eligible dependants who do not hold a valid  foreign driver's license with a motorcycle endorsement permitting the operation of a  motorcycle with an engine size of 250 cm3 or above, and who wish to obtain a  motorcycle endorsement on a driver's license issued by the Office of Foreign  Missions, to meet the requirements for novice motorcycle operators as imposed in  the United States state in which they live.     To ensure that motorcycle operators possess the necessary motorcycle safety  skills, the Department has concluded that it is necessary, for reasons of public and  rider safety, to require motorcycle training/testing in instances in which the  applicant's motorcycle endorsement was issued under foreign standards that are less  stringent than those applied by states in the United States, as determined by the  Office of Foreign Missions. The Secretariat will be notified separately in writing if  such a determination is made.     The United States Mission wishes to take this opportunity to provide the  following details on the new policy of the Department for the issuance of a  motorcycle endorsement:     1.  The Office of Foreign Missions will not require any additional testing if  an applicant holds a valid foreign driver's license with a motorcycle endorsement  permitting the operation of a motorcycle with an engine size of 125 cm3 or above; and     2.  The Office of Foreign Missions has found that the issuing country's  motorcycle endorsement testing and preparation requirements are equivalent to  United States standards.     3.  If the applicant does not meet the criteria set out in paragraph 1 above,  he/she will now be required to complete the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF)  ""Basic Rider"" course, which is offered in 48 states, or the approved course in the  state in which the applicant lives, all of which meet or exceed the standards  established by the Foundation. To determine an applicant's nearest training provider  and course availability, missions are requested to visit the Foundation's website at    ST/IC/2014/29    3/6  14-67560    www.msf-usa.org/students.aspx. Please note that the cost of these courses varies by  jurisdiction.     The Secretariat is informed that eligible staff members are only required to  obtain a driver's license with a motorcycle endorsement issued by the Office of  Foreign Missions for the operation of a moped, scooter or motorcycle with an  engine size of 49 cm3 and above. For the operation of the above-mentioned vehicles  with an engine size below 49 cm3, a regular class C driver's license is sufficient.     The United States Mission to the United Nations appreciates the continuing  cooperation of the Secretariat with the host country's motor vehicle programme.

A list of documents that serve as points of  identification can be found on the New York State Department of Motor  Vehicles website (www.dmv.ny.gov). A United Nations employee identification  card can serve as one point of identification only for the principal. As the I-94  issued to G-4 visa holders is normally marked ""D/S"" (for duration of status),  the employee's identification card must have at least six months' validity  remaining.     - The Social Security Administration's letter of ineligibility does not serve as a  point of identification. These individuals will need three more ""points of  identification"". Examples are debit/credit card, each one point; utility or cell  phone bill, each one point.     Persons presenting a letter of ineligibility (usually dependants) will also be  subject to secondary verification through the immigration database while they wait.     - For dependants, the Midtown Manhattan office of the New York State  Department of Motor Vehicles has agreed to accept a photocopy of the  employee's identification card to address the ""duration of status"" issue. The  dependant's G-4 visa should have an annotation indicating the applicant's  connection to the employee. If the visa is not so annotated, the dependant will  be required to present the principal's identification card or visa/passport.         For driver's license renewals       First-time licenses are issued for an eight-year period. Renewals are for eight  years.

A  list of acceptable secondary documents can be found on the Department of  Motor Vehicles website. A United Nations employee identification card,  although it does not appear on the website's list of secondary documents, is  also acceptable.     - Social Security card or letter of ineligibility issued by the Social Security  Administration.   The above items must be the originals; photocopies are not accepted.     - The Social Security Administration's letter of ineligibility does not serve as a  point of identification. Individuals with such letters will need one more point  of identification. A list of documents serving as points of identification can be  found  on  the  Connecticut  Department  of  Motor  Vehicles  website  (www.ct.gov/dmv).     Persons presenting a letter of ineligibility (usually dependants) will also be  subject to secondary verification through the immigration database while they wait.  If timely responses from Immigration are not received, the applicant will be asked to  return to the same office at a later date. Employment authorization documents are  accepted.     - The applicant must also provide two separate pieces of mail from separate  sources showing Connecticut residence, such as telephone bills, lease  contracts, etc. These items must be less than 90 days old.         For driver's license renewal       To renew a Connecticut driver's license, applicants only need to present their  current Connecticut driver's license. The Connecticut driver's license will provide  the points of identification required.          New Jersey           First-time applicants       Non-immigrant visa holders (to include G-4 visa holders) must show:     - The passport with visa and I-94     - Social Security card or letter of ineligibility issued by the Social Security  Administration   The above items must be the originals; photocopies are not accepted.   ST/IC/2014/29      14-67560  6/6      - If the applicant presents a Social Security card, only one more point of  identification is required. A list of documents that serve as points of  identification can be found at the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission  website (www.state.nj.us/mvc). A United Nations employee identification card  can serve as one point of identification.     - The Social Security Administration's letter of ineligibility does not serve as a  point of identification. These individuals will need two more points of  identification. Persons presenting an ineligibility letter (usually dependants)  will also be subject to secondary verification through the immigration database  while they wait. Employment authorization documents are accepted as one  point of identification.     - The applicant must also provide proof of New Jersey residence, such as a  telephone bill, lease contract, etc. The item must be in the applicant's name.         For driver's license renewal       For persons whose I-94 is marked ""D/S"", New Jersey issues a license valid for  one year plus 90 days. To renew a New Jersey driver's license, the applicant must  again present the passport, visa and I-94 and the New Jersey driver's license to be  renewed, in addition to one additional point of identification, such as a Social  Security or ATM card or bank statement. The license will be renewed for another  period of one year plus 90 days.     "

It is the total compensation payable by the  Organization for costs incurred by the eligible staff member and his or her family  members as a result of an appointment, assignment or transfer involving relocation,  as well as any pre-departure expenses that the staff member may incur as a result.         Elements     1.2 The grant consists of:    (a)  A daily subsistence allowance (DSA) portion, payable in accordance  with the provisions and criteria detailed in section 2; and     (b)  A lump-sum portion, payable in accordance with the provisions and  criteria detailed in section 3.        Eligibility     1.3 Staff members who are internationally recruited under staff rule 4.5 and who  hold an appointment other than a temporary appointment shall be eligible for  payment of the settling-in grant, provided they meet the requirements set out in the  present instruction.   1.4 Staff members who are internationally recruited pursuant to staff rule 4.5 and  who hold a temporary appointment shall be eligible for payment of the DSA portion  of the grant for themselves only, subject to meeting the requirements set out in the  ST/AI/2016/5      16-11299  2/7    present instruction.

Other accommodation changes within the  area of commuting distance, and promotion or recruitment to the Professional  category of a staff member previously serving in another category at the same duty  station, shall not give rise to payment of the grant.   1.7 Pursuant to section 1.6 above, a staff member shall be eligible for payment of  the grant when he or she has been authorized to proceed on travel involving  relocation from beyond commuting distance and necessitating a change of  accommodation, when the travel is within the same country.  1.8 When the assignment to a new duty station is for less than one year and the  Secretary-General, under staff rule 3.7 (c) (ii), has decided to apply the post  adjustment applicable to the duty station and related entitlements such as the settling- in grant, the grant shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of section 6.2.

A child born or  adopted or a spouse recognized after the time of initial appointment shall not give  rise to payment of DSA, regardless of whether the Organization provides travel to  the duty station.  2.2 The rates mentioned in section 2.1 shall be the ones in effect in the duty  station on the date of arrival at the duty station of the staff member and the staff  member's eligible family member, as appropriate.  2.3 At duty stations other than those classified in the H category, the normal 30-day  period may be extended up to a maximum of 90 days, in accordance with staff rule  7.14 (c) (ii).

Currency of payment     3.5 The lump-sum portion of the grant shall normally be paid in United States  dollars, subject to the rules governing currency of payment of salaries and  allowances.2         Section 4      Special conditions applicable when both spouses are staff members     4.1 When a staff member is married to another staff member or to a staff member  of another organization of the United Nations common system and each spouse  travels on appointment, transfer or assignment at the expense of the Organization to  the same duty station:    (a)  Each staff member shall receive the DSA portion of the grant for himself  or herself, computed in accordance with section 2;    (b)  The DSA portion in respect of dependent children travelling to the duty  station shall be paid to the staff member on whom they are recognized as being  dependent;    (c)  Only one lump sum shall be paid, normally to the spouse employed at a  higher grade and on the basis of his or her emoluments.  4.2 When both spouses travel on appointment, transfer or assignment at the  expense of the Organization to different duty stations:    (a)  Each staff member shall receive the DSA portion of the grant for himself  or herself, computed in accordance with section 2;    (b)  The DSA portion in respect of dependent children travelling to one of the  duty stations where their parents are assigned shall normally be paid to the parent  on whom they are recognized as being dependent, unless the child accompanies the  other parent and both staff members request that the DSA portion be paid to that  other parent;    (c)  Each staff member shall receive the lump-sum portion applicable to his  or her situation, in accordance with section 3.      ST/AI/2016/5    5/7  16-11299        Section 5      Timing of payment of the grant     5.1 The DSA portion of the grant in respect of the staff member and the lump-sum  portion are normally payable on the actual date of arrival at the duty station, or on  the date of recruitment to an appointment giving rise to payment of the grant.   5.2 The DSA portion of the grant in respect of eligible family members is payable  on the actual date of arrival of each family member at the duty station and not  earlier than the arrival date of the staff member at the duty station.         Advance against lump-sum portion     5.3 An advance of 80 per cent of the lump-sum portion of the grant, as computed  at the time the advance payment is made, may be paid up to three months in  advance of travel of a staff member assigned or transferred to a new duty station.   5.4 No advance against the lump-sum portion may be made in the case of initial  appointments.  5.5 When an advance is paid, the releasing office shall so notify the receiving  office, which shall make the necessary adjustments upon the staff member 's arrival  at the new duty station.        Section 6      Adjustment/recovery         Return to the same duty station     6.1 When a change of official duty station or a new appointment involves a return  to a place at which the internationally recruited staff member was previously  stationed, and where a settling-in grant had been paid, the full amount of the grant  (composed of both the DSA and lump-sum portions, where applicable) shall be paid  only when the staff member has been absent from that place for at least one year. In  the case of a shorter absence, the amount payable shall normally be that proportion  of the full amount of the grant (i.e. DSA and lump sum) that the completed months  of absence bear to 12 months.        Assignment of less than one year     6.2 When the assignment to a new duty station is for less than one year and the  Secretary-General has decided to pay post adjustment and related entitlements,  including settling-in grant, as provided in section 1.8, and pursuant to staff   rule 3.7 (c) (ii):    (a)  The DSA portion of the grant shall be paid in full;    (b)  The lump-sum portion, where payable in accordance with section 3, shall  be prorated in the proportion that the number of months of appointment bears to 12  months.    Should the appointment or assignment be subsequently extended to one year or  longer at the same duty station, the staff member shall receive the balance of the  lump-sum portion which would have been paid had the initial appointment been for  one year or longer.  ST/AI/2016/5      16-11299  6/7    6.3 Pursuant to staff rule 7.10, staff members shall receive an appropriate daily  subsistence allowance for periods of duty away from their official duty station,  provided that such period does not exceed the maximum duration under staff rule  4.8. Any extension of such assignment, in accordance with staff rule 4.8, shall result  in a change of duty station and payment of the post adjustment and related  entitlements, notwithstanding staff rule 3.7 (c). The change in duty station may also  result in the payment of a settling-in grant (both DSA and lump-sum portions, where  applicable), provided the following conditions are met:    (a)  The total expected period of service at the duty station, including the  period during which the staff received the subsistence allowance, is at least 12  months;    (b)  The extension occurs at least six months prior to the expected end of the  appointment or assignment at the duty station.    However, when subsistence allowance has been paid for a period not  exceeding the maximum duration under staff rule 4.8, and the assignment is  extended to reach a total period of less than 12 months, including the period during  which the staff received the subsistence allowance, the staff member is not entitled  to the DSA portion of the grant. Only the lump-sum portion of the grant shall be  paid in accordance with sections 3 and 6.2 (b).         Reduction in period of service at the duty station     6.4 In cases where the staff member has not completed the period of service,  except for reasons as noted in section 6.5, in respect of which the settling-in grant  has been paid, the grant shall be adjusted proportionately and recovery made as  follows:    (a)  The DSA portion of the grant paid on arrival at the duty station shall  normally not be recoverable; and    (b)  The lump-sum portion of the grant shall be prorated and recovered or  adjusted in the proportion that the period of service at the duty station bears to one  year.   6.5 The Secretary-General may grant an exception to the provisions of section 6.4  for compelling and/or compassionate reasons (e.g. health, reduction of the duration  of an appointment or assignment at the direction of the Organization, i.e. due to  closure or restructuring of a department/office, or for other reasons beyond the  control of the staff member). In such instances there shall be no prorating of any  portion of the grant.         Section 7      Transitional measures     7.1 For staff members who were paid an assignment grant on or prior to 30 June  2016, the following provisions will apply to the lump-sum portion of the assignment  grant.   7.2 A staff member who is appointed or reassigned for one year or longer to a  category A to E duty station, and does not have a removal entitlement, shall receive  a lump-sum payment equivalent to:    ST/AI/2016/5    7/7  16-11299      (a)  One month's net salary and, where appropriate, post adjustment at the  duty station of assignment if the duration of the assignment is expected to be of one  year or longer but less than three years; or    (b)  Two months' net salary and, where appropriate, post adjustment at the  duty station of assignment if the assignment is expected to be for three years or  longer.  7.3 The lump-sum portion of the grant shall be adjusted or recovered when the  staff member has not completed the period of service in respect of which the lump - sum portion of the assignment grant has been paid. When a two-month lump sum  has been paid and the completed period of service at the duty station is less than  three years, the lump sum shall be adjusted/recovered as follows:    (a)  If the completed period of service at the duty station is less than one  year, the first month's lump sum shall be prorated and recovered/adjusted in the  proportion that the period of service bears to the first year (12 months) of  assignment. The second month's lump sum shall be recovered in full;    (b)  If the completed period of service at the duty station is one year or more  but less than two years, there shall be no recovery in respect of the first month's  lump sum, but the second month's lump sum shall be recovered in full;    (c)  If the completed period of service at the duty station is more than two  years but less than three years, there shall be no recovery in respect of the first  month's lump sum, but the second month's lump sum shall be prorated and  recovered/adjusted in the proportion that the completed period of service in the third  year of assignment (i.e., the period exceeding 24 months) bears to the third year (12  months) of assignment.    If the completed period of service at the duty station is three years or more, the  lump sum shall not be recovered/adjusted.   7.4 These transitional measures are applicable only to any appointment,  assignment or transfer with an effective date on or prior to 30 June 2016. The  transitional measures shall cease to be in effect from 30 June 2019.

Section 2  Eligibility      2.1 A staff member in any category holding an appointment other than temporary is  eligible for the special education grant and related benefit (i.e. reimbursement of  capital assessment fees), including when serving in the recognized home country.         Section 3  Conditions of entitlement      3.1 The special education grant and related benefit is available to an eligible staff  member provided that:     (a)  The Medical Services Division of the Office of Human Resources  Management certifies that the child:    (i)  Is unable, by reason of physical or mental disability, to attend a regular  educational institution and therefore requires special teaching or training, on a  full or part-time basis, to prepare him or her for full integration into society; or     (ii) While attending a regular educational institution, requires special teaching  or training to assist him or her in overcoming the disability; and  ST/AI/2018/2      18-00986  2/8      (b)  The staff member demonstrates that she or he has exhausted all other  sources of benefits that may be available for the education and training of the child,  including those provided by States, local governments and medical insurance.   3.2 The entitlement commences from the beginning of the school year in progress  when the need for special teaching or training is certified, unless the certificate  indicates a different date, or from the date the staff member becomes eligible.          Section 4  Exclusions and cessation of entitlement      4.1 A staff member assigned to a non-family duty station is not authorized to be  accompanied by family members. Consequently, a staff member shall not be eligible  for a special education grant and related benefit in respect of a child attending an  educational institution at a non-family duty station.  4.2 A staff member ceases to be eligible for the special education grant and related  benefit when the child in respect of whom the staff member was in receipt of the  entitlement:    (a)  Ceases to be in full-time attendance at an educational institution; or    (b)  Is awarded the first recognized post-secondary degree or up to the end of  the academic year in which the child reaches the age of 28, whichever is earlier.          Section 5  Special education grant: admissible educational expenses      5.1 The special education grant will be computed on the basis of the following  educational expenses:    (a)  Expenses required to provide an educational programme designed to meet  the needs of a child with a disability so that he or she may attain the highest level of  functional ability. Those expenses may include:    (i)  Expenses for special teaching or training services;     (ii) Other expenses, including tuition, enrolment-related fees and the purchase  of textbooks and meals at school, which are directly related to mandatory  educational programmes and not related to extracurricular activities;    (iii) Expenses for special equipment required to meet the child's educational  needs;    (iv) Expenses for full board (food and lodging), including in the case of a child  attending an educational institution at the duty station when such boarding is an  integral part of the educational programme;    (b)  Expenses incurred for local transportation required by the child with a  disability as certified by the Medical Services Division.  5.2  All other expenses that are not listed in section 5.1 above, including expenses  covered or partially covered by medical insurance, shall be deemed non-admissible.         ST/AI/2018/2    3/8  18-00986       Section 6  Amount of the grant      6.1 The admissible educational expenses actually incurred for each child with a  disability who is unable to attend a regular educational institution, or who attends on  a full-time basis a regular educational institution that provides the necessary special  arrangements, will be reimbursed at 100 per cent, subject to the following:     (a)  The overall maximum amount of the grant shall be equal to the upper limit  of the top bracket of the global sliding scale applicable to the education grant scheme  indicated in paragraph 2 (a) of the annex to the present instruction;     (b)  If the child is boarding for the purpose of attending an educational  institution, the amount equivalent to the boarding lump sum of the education grant  scheme and related benefits will be added to the overall maximum amount mentioned  in section 6.1 (a) above, as indicated in paragraph 2 (b) of the annex.  6.2 When the expenses for full-time attendance at a regular educational institution  are reimbursed under the regular education scheme governed by the provisions of  administrative instruction ST/AI/2018/1, admissible educational expenses incurred  for special teaching and training outside the educational institution and for boarding  shall be reimbursed at the 100 per cent rate. The combined total of the two grants  shall not exceed the amount specified in paragraphs 2 (a) or 2 (b) of the annex, as  applicable.   6.3 If a staff member is not entitled to the regular education grant for the child in  full-time attendance at a regular educational institution, admissible educational  expenses incurred for special teaching and training outside a regular educational  institution will be reimbursed against the special education grant at the 100 per cent  rate, subject to the maximum amount specified in paragraph 2 (a) of the annex.  6.4 Equipment for educational purposes in all cases will be reimbursed up to a  maximum of two thirds of the amount payable for the flat sum for boarding within  the applicable maximum amount mentioned in section 6.1 (a) above.  6.5 The amount of admissible educational expenses shall be reduced by the amount  of any benefits that may be available from other sources, including scholarships,  bursaries or similar grants for the child's special education and training, which shall  be reported in line with section 3.1 (b) above.  6.6  All scholarships, bursaries or similar grants received by or on behalf of the child  shall be deducted first from those expenses that are not admissible, and the balance,  if any, shall be deducted from the admissible educational expenses before the amount  of the grant is computed. Any remaining balance will be deducted from the special  education grant-related benefit.  6.7  Financial assistance in the form of loans to assist in the payment of educational  expenses, which have to be repaid to a financial institution by the staff member or the  child, are not considered to be scholarship, bursary or similar grants.          Section 7  Reimbursement of capital assessment fees      7.1 Capital assessment fees are mandatory non-refundable fees levied by  educational institutions to fund the construction, upgrade, refurbishment and  maintenance of buildings. Such fees, also known as building levies/funds/fees, capital  levies/funds/fees, first-time parent fees and development fees, may be levied as a  one-time payment upon initial enrolment, on an annual basis or on an as needed basis.  ST/AI/2018/2      18-00986  4/8    7.2 Capital assessment fees will be reimbursed at 100 per cent, in addition to the  special education grant, upon certification from the institution that:    (a)  The purpose of the fees is consistent with the description provided in  section 7.1 above;    (b)  The child's enrolment in the institution is conditioned upon the payment  of the fees.

For purposes of use of official cars, operational functions2 are those  actions that can be accomplished by use of a car including authorized  transportation to and from a UN facility to a location outside of UN offices on  official business, collection of mail, equipment pick-up or delivery or any  other authorized operation that is required to support the functioning of the  Organization in any location or duty station.        For purposes of use of official cars, official requirements3 include  authorized participation in outside functions requiring the attendance of a UN  official, subject to the availability of vehicles for that purpose and appropriate  authorization as defined in  ST/AI/2006/1.      General principles      Pursuant to ST/AI/2006/1, the policy on the provision and use of  official cars applies to all established United Nations offices but does not  apply to separately administered funds and programmes. The policy also  does not apply to peacekeeping operations or to technical assistance  projects, for which separate policies are in effect.  According to the policy, official cars are only made available to the  Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General for their exclusive use.                                                     1 Generally, official business is understood to include activities, responsibilities or other  operational functions that are required for the functioning of the Organization and performed  by staff members or other individuals with a contractual arrangement with the United Nations.   Examples of official business include, but are not limited to, performance of work  responsibilities as defined in a work plan or mandated by the General Assembly, official travel,  official meetings with host-country officials, attendance at conferences, other functions such  as meals and diplomatic receptions, and staff representational activities.      2 Operational functions are those activities required for the functioning of the Organization  including, but not limited to, facilities management, administrative support services,  documents control, translation/interpretation, security and all other functions that ensure that  the Organization provides mandated services to its clients.      3 ""Official requirements"" are understood to mean official business that is deemed essential to  the proper functioning of United Nations Offices.      Guidelines for the use of official cars    Page 2 of 3                                                                           Approved on 11 December 2006  The official cars used for this purpose are not to be included in the pool of  official cars.      Heads of the respective offices at the principal UN locations other than  New York, Geneva and Vienna may be assigned an official car on a full-time  basis.  However, that use should be for official business and for  transportation to and from work.  When the vehicle is not required by the  Heads of offices, it should be made available for other official requirements  that are deemed essential to the proper functioning of United Nations  offices.4      In implementing the instruction, Heads of offices at principal offices  other than New York, Geneva and Vienna, assigned an official car on a full- time basis should take into consideration the operational functions of their  respective offices, local security conditions, as well as existing transportation  options.  Hence, when and where possible, those Heads should allow their  cars to be used for other official business.  For duty stations with specific  security concerns, further guidelines taking into account these local  conditions may be elaborated, as a means to ensure that official vehicles are  used to the maximum extent possible to conduct all duty station specific  official business.      All other official cars in all other duty stations are considered part of  the pool, available for all operational functions of the office concerned.   Heads of offices and programmes in Geneva and Vienna may be assigned a  car from the pool for official business and transportation to and from work.   However, that assignment is not on a full-time basis.      Authorization for use of official cars    Authorization for use of official cars on official business is not  automatic and is subject to the provisions set out in ST/AI/2006/1.      When deciding on requests for use of official cars from the pool of  official cars, authorizing officials should take into account the operational  purpose the request will fulfill and whether that purpose can be accomplished  via other means, including use of public transportation.                                                      4 For purposes of these guidelines, established offices are office staffed through the regular  budget of the organization.  According to section 1 of ST/SGB/1997/5, ""The Secretariat of the  United Nations, which is one of the six principal organs of the Organization, is located at the  Headquarters of the United Nations in New York.  It has major duty stations in Addis Ababa,  Bangkok, Beirut, Geneva, Nairobi, Santiago and Vienna.""  Offices at these duty stations would  be considered established offices.  Established peacekeeping missions where staff members  receive entitlements similar to staff members serving at headquarters duty stations due to the  established nature of its operations would also be included in the definition of established  office.      Page 3 of 3                                                                           Approved on 11 December 2006  Requests for exceptions are to be forwarded to the Office of the  Under-Secretary-General for Management for consideration and decision.   Requests should include a properly documented justification for the request  which, according to the instruction should be based on reasons of health,  security or other location-specific factors.      Use of official cars for personal purposes is normally prohibited unless  expressly authorized in advance on the understanding that staff members or  individuals with a contractual arrangement with the Organization shall  reimburse the Organization for any expenses associated with that use.

A request for a G-5 visa must also be accompanied by a proposed  employment  contract,  which  includes conditions of service that comply with United States law. The Visa Committee will supply staff members with model employment contracts, which must be completed by both parties to the employment contract and be submitted prior to the issuance of the G-5 visa. No request for visa may be endorsed without the above-mentioned documentation. 3.4 On the basis of the documentation provided by the staff member, and once the Committee is satisfied that all the relevant conditions are fulfilled, the Visa Committee shall recommend to the Assistant Secretary- General for Human Resources Management whether the request should be endorsed. *Personnel Manual index No. 13020A. 2 ST/SGB/2000/11 3.5 Endorsed requests shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Visa Committee to the United States Mission to the United Nations.

The purpose of the present information circular is to provide information on a  diplomatic note received from the United States Mission to the United Nations. The  text of the diplomatic note, dated 2 July 2019, is set out in the annex to the present  circular. The diplomatic note informs the United Nations Secretariat of changes to the  visa requirements for United Nations interns serving in the United States of America.   2.  Interns who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States and who  are undertaking an internship in which they would work 35 hours or more per week,  must have a visa status that allows them to undertake the internship. The present  information circular does not apply to interns undertaking internships in which they  would work less than 35 hours per week.  3.  Interns already in the United States on a non-immigrant visa status other than a  G-4 visa (e.g., an F-1,1 G-1, G-3 visa, etc.) are responsible for ensuring that they have  an appropriate, valid visa and, if required, employment authorization, allowing them  to undertake the internship.   4.  Effective 1 September 2019, interns must qualify for and obtain G-4 visa status  prior to starting the internship if they are not: (a) United States citizens; (b) United  States permanent residents; or (c) currently in the United States on an appropriate,  valid non-immigrant visa allowing them to undertake the internship.         Special provisions    5.   Interns who have started their internship, and whose internship will go beyond  1 January 2020, shall obtain a G-4 visa abroad or apply for a change to G-4 visa status  within the United States, unless they are: (a) United States citizens; (b) United States  permanent residents; or (c) currently in the United States on an appropriate, valid  non-immigrant visa allowing them to undertake the internship. If the change to G-4  __________________    *  The present information circular will be in effect until further notice.     1  Prospective interns in F-1 status who wish to undertake an internship following the completion  of their academic programme as part of Optional Practical Training may need to seek a change of  visa status to G-4 and should consult their academic institution.   ST/IC/2020/8      20-02317  2/3    visa status has not yet occurred, such interns and their responsible United Nations  entities shall ensure that the G-4 visa is acquired immediately.        Process for requesting and obtaining a G-4 visa     6.  When an intern requires a G-4 visa, the responsible United Nations entity shall  submit a request to the Travel and Transportation Section, Department of Operational  Support, using the ""Request for United States visa"" form (TTS.1).   7.   A cable or note from the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Section will be  transmitted to the relevant United States Embassy or Consulate requesting the  issuance of a G-4 visa to the intern.   8.   The responsible United Nations entity shall provide the intern with a separate  document that contains the following language: ""The tasks to be performed by [name  of intern] will be under the direction of the United Nations and the United Nations  will exercise supervisory authority over [name of intern]'s assignments."" The intern  shall be advised to submit this document along with the visa application package,  consisting of a DS-160 application form, a valid national passport issued by the  Government of the official nationality and a copy of the cable or note from the Chief  of the Travel and Transportation Section to the United States Embassy or Consulate.  9.   After starting the internship, the intern and the responsible United Nations entity  are required to complete and sign the appropriate induction questionnaire form. The  form shall be submitted to the Travel and Transportation Section for the purpose of  registering the intern with the United States Mission to the United Nations.        Completion of internship and G-4 visa    10. Interns on G-4 visas valid for a period extending beyond the internship with the  United Nations are not eligible to remain in the United States and, at their sole  expense and responsibility, must leave the country or seek an adjustment of status  with United States authorities within 30 days after the last day of the internship.  11.  Interns on G-4 visas must abide by the terms and conditions of their admission  and comply with departure procedures. Unauthorized use of a valid United States visa  issued for service with the United Nations may be a violation of United States law.   12.  At the conclusion of the internship, interns and their responsible United Nations  entities are required to complete and sign the ""Exit interview"" form (P.18) and submit  it to the Travel and Transportation Section to terminate the interns' registration with  the United States Mission to the United Nations.         ST/IC/2020/8    3/3  20-02317    Annex        Diplomatic note dated 2 July 2019 from the United States Mission  to the United Nations addressed to the United Nations Secretariat         The United States Mission to the United Nations presents its compliments to the  United Nations Secretariat and has the honor to inform the Secretariat of changes to  the nonimmigrant visa requirements for United Nations interns.     Beginning September 1, 2019, all full-time United Nations interns, other than  U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, must qualify for and obtain a G-4  noninmigrant visa prior to participation in a United Nations internship program. Such  interns will not be permitted to obtain and enter the United States to participate in a  United Nations internship program on a B-1 visa after this date. Any full-time interns  currently in B-1 nonimmigrant status may complete their internship without seeking  a change of status, provided the internship will be completed no later than January 1,  2020. If an internship will go beyond this date, the intern should apply for a change  of status from B-1 to G-4 nonimmigrant status.     The United States Mission to the United Nations notes that this policy change  is intended to align United Nations interns with interns of other designated  international organizations as well as interns temporarily assigned to missions to the  United Nations. The Department of State will be updating guidance in the Foreign  Affairs Manual accordingly to eliminate issuance of a B-1 visa for certain UN interns  of ""H1-B caliber"" (9 FAM 402.3-7(D)(2)) and for participants in the United Nations  Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) program (9 FAM 402.2-5(E)(6)).     The United Nations Mission to the United Nations also reminds the United  Nations that a cable/note from the Chief of the Transportation Section, United Nations  Secretariat is required for all United Nations officers and employees applying for a  G-4 visa, including UN interns applying for a G-4 visa. G-4 visas are only available  for full-time interns at the United Nations Headquarters.     In addition, the United States Mission to the United Nations reminds the United  Nations that interns applying for a G-4 visa must have a note that contains either  (1) an express statement that the international organization considers the applicant its  employee during the internship, or (2) an acknowledgement that the international  organization will exercise ultimate authority over the continuation of the intern's  assignment and the control and direction of the official duties to be performed for the  duration of the intern's U.S. assignment. This requirement may be met by submitting  a note from the appropriate United Nations office within the United Nations  Headquarters in New York to which the intern is to be assigned, to supplement the  cable/note from the Transportation Office.     The United Nations Mission to the United Nations avails itself of this  opportunity to renew to the United Nations Secretariat the assurances of the highest  consideration.    "
"travel","United Nations ST/IC/2001/27   Secretariat 10 April 2001 01-32888 (E)    260401 *0132888* Information circular* To: Members of the staff From: The Under-Secretary-General for Management Subject: Visa status in the United States of America 1. The purpose of the present circular is to provide additional information on the conditions of application of administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/19 (Visa status of non-United States staff members serving in the United States, members of their household and their household employees, and staff members seeking or holding permanent resident status in the United States). Staff members should familiarize themselves thoroughly with the provisions of that instruction. It is available on the Intranet, where it can be accessed under ""reference material"". 2. Questions pertaining to G-4 visas are covered in section I of this circular (paras. 3-25). Section II concerns questions relating to permanent resident status, in respect of staff members at the time of recruitment or while employed (paras. 26-30) as well as former staff members after separation from service on a G-4 visa and certain of their relatives (paras. 31-32). Section III deals with G-5 visa questions (paras. 34-52). Section I. G-4 visas What is a G-4 visa and who is eligible for it? 3. The G-4 visa is a non-immigrant visa granted to officials or employees of international organizations while stationed on official business in the United States of America, as well as to members of their immediate families. The United States authorities grant a G-4 visa in order to permit staff members who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States to work at United Nations Headquarters in New York or in other locations in the United States. 4. The immediate family of a staff member eligible for a G-4 visa include a spouse, unmarried dependent children under the age of 21 and children for whom a staff member receives an education grant. 5. Other relatives, including children who are 21 years old or older for whom the staff member does not receive an education grant, may be eligible for a G-4 visa * The present circular will be in effect until further notice. 2 ST/IC/2001/27 when they demonstrate close ties and a continued dependency on the staff member. It must be established that they seek entry to the United States in order to reside with the staff member. This excludes applications that are submitted for other purposes, such as study, the pursuit of business or employment opportunities. Applications for a G-4 visa for relatives other than the immediate family of the staff member are submitted to the United Nations Visa Committee, and subsequently to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management for approval. 6. The Visa Committee will generally give favourable consideration to applications by relatives previously living in the staff member's household before coming to the United States and for parents who are over the age of 65. If the relative was not previously living in the staff member's household, the staff member will be required to explain the compelling reasons for which the relative would now join his or her household. If the relative is not financially dependent on the staff member, the staff member will be required to justify the request on other compelling grounds, such as physical need for family care in the case of parents, or incapacity or minority in the case of siblings. Application for G-4 visas 7. For staff members who are newly recruited to New York, or assigned or transferred to New York from another duty station: (a) The Human Resources Officer handling the recruitment or the Executive Officer handling the assignment or transfer prepares an application for G-4 visa(s) for the staff member and his or her immediate family members; (b) The Office of Human Resources Management or the executive office submits the application to the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service, Office of Conference and Support Services; (c) The Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service issues a formal request for issuance of a G-4 visa for the staff member and immediate family members to the appropriate United States consular office where the visa will be granted. 8. For staff members already in the United States who seek conversion of a prior visa to G-4 status for themselves or members of their immediate family: (a) The staff member obtains form PT.63* (request for change to G-4 visa status) or form PT.63/A* (request for change to G-4 visa status for spouse and family members) and submits the completed form to the Human Resources Officer; (b) The Office of Human Resources Management transmits the request to the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service for transmittal to the United States Mission. 9. For staff members requesting a G-4 visa for relatives other than immediate family members: (a) The staff member obtains form TTS.1,* and forms VC.3 and VC.4 from the secretariat of the Visa Committee, and submits the completed forms to the secretariat of the Committee, together with evidence of health insurance; * Available on Intranet, Quicklink ""Forms"". 3 ST/IC/2001/27 (b) If the request is approved, the Visa Committee secretariat transmits completed form TTS.1 to the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service together with evidence of health insurance; (c) The Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service issues a formal request for issuance of a G-4 visa to the United States consular office where the applicant will appear in person; (d) A copy of the request is given to the staff member for transmittal to the relative. The staff member should advise the relative to go to the United States consular office with a valid national passport in order to obtain the visa. The relative may not apply for, or accept, any other type of visa while awaiting issuance of a G-4 visa. Duration of authorized stay and extension of G-4 visa 10. The duration of the G-4 visa and the number of entries granted by the United States authorities depend on a number of factors, including the contractual status and nationality of the visa holder. 11. When a staff member or a family member to whom a G-4 visa has been granted arrives in the United States, the immigration official generally records ""G-4, D/S"" on United States Government form I-94 (permission to stay, arrival-departure record), which is stapled into the passport. This notation establishes the G-4 visa status as valid for as long as the staff member remains in the employ of the United Nations and does not leave the United States. 12. However, if a specific expiration date for the G-4 visa status is recorded on form I-94, and the staff member is required to remain on duty in the United States beyond the specified date, the staff member must request an extension by writing a memorandum to the Chief of the Transportation and Travel Service through his or her executive office. Extension requests for relatives other than immediate family members should be submitted to the Visa Committee secretariat. All requests for an extension should be presented at least 30 working days before the expiration date specified on the I-94 form. Request for renewal of G-4 visa in case of travel and re-entry into the United States 13. Before leaving the United States on official or personal travel, staff members and their family members on a G-4 visa should make sure that the G-4 visa stamped in their passports will still be valid on the expected date of re-entry. If not, they will have no valid document for re-entry as the I-94 form is removed upon departure from the United States. 14. If the G-4 visa has expired, and there are at least 15 working days before departure from the United States, a new G-4 visa for the staff member and immediate family members should be requested as follows: (a) The staff member obtains form PT.61,* completes it in duplicate and submits it to the executive or administrative office, with the national passport or the United Nations laissez-passer; * Available on Intranet, Quicklink, ""Forms"". 4 ST/IC/2001/27 (b) The executive or administrative office certifies the completed forms; (c) The staff member hand-delivers the completed forms, together with the passport or laissez-passer, to the Travel and Transportation Service, which will forward it to the United States Mission. 15. If there are less than 15 working days before departure from the United States, a new G-4 visa for the staff member and immediate family members should be requested as follows: (a) The staff member obtains form TTS.1,* completes the form, obtains certification of the form from the executive or administrative office and submits it to the Travel and Transportation Service; (b) The Travel and Transportation Service gives to the staff member a copy of the facsimile request addressed to the appropriate United States consulate or embassy abroad where that copy will have to be presented in order to obtain a new G-4 visa. 16. Requests for new G-4 visas for relatives other than immediate family members should be submitted to the Visa Committee. The Visa Committee secretariat transmits endorsed requests to the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service. Expiration and cancellation of G-4 visas 17. When a staff member separates from service, goes on special leave with or without pay, or is transferred to a duty station outside the United States, his or her right to stay in the United States expires automatically, even if the G-4 visa stamped in the passport shows a date of validity beyond the date of separation or transfer. The same applies to family members whose G-4 visa status is derivative from the status of the staff member. 18. Staff members are required to comply strictly with the procedure set out in section 3 of ST/AI/2000/19 for cancellation of G-4 visas for themselves and their family members prior to the effective date of their separation from service, special leave or transfer. This must be done, at the latest, one week prior to that date. Visas that have already expired do not have to be cancelled under that procedure. 19. Staff members who have obtained a G-4 visa for a spouse from whom they are subsequently divorced are required to follow the procedure prescribed in section 3.3 of ST/AI/2000/19. 20. During the exit interview required before departure, staff members will be requested to confirm that they have followed the visa cancellation procedures and provide a photocopy of the cancelled or expired visas. 21. In practice, United States authorities allow staff members and their families 30 days to leave the country or adjust their status after the date of expiration of their G-4 visa. If additional time is required, the staff member should contact the Office of Host Country Affairs at the United States Mission without delay. 22. In the event of the death in service of a staff member with G-4 status, the Staff Counsellor may be contacted for guidance in requesting extension of the normal 30- day period for surviving family members who are on derivative G-4 visas. * Available on Intranet, Quicklink ""Forms"". 5 ST/IC/2001/27 Permission to work for holders of derivative G-4 visas 23. Employment of spouses and dependent children who are on derivative G-4 visas is generally authorized, within certain limitations. Employment is not authorized for other relatives who may also have a derivative G-4 visa. Unmarried children who are less than 23 years old and are full-time students seeking to work part time during the academic year, or full time during school holidays, are normally authorized to do so without limitations. Children on G-4 visas who have reached their twenty-third birthday will not be authorized to work unless they are physically or mentally disabled. 24. The necessary information and forms to seek authorization to work may be obtained from the Staff Counsellor's office. Requests for permission to accept employment must be submitted to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service through the United States Mission. Permission is required before employment begins. It may be granted for a maximum period of three years and may be renewed. A new request must be submitted upon each change of employment. 25. All income earned in the United States by holders of derivative G-4 visas is subject to income and social security taxes. Section II. Permanent resident status For staff members at the time of recruitment or while employed 26. Under section 5.6 of ST/AI/2000/19, non-United States citizens who have permanent resident status in the United States are required to renounce such status and to change to G-4 visa status upon appointment. The same rule provides that staff members who seek to change to permanent resident status will not be granted permission to sign the waiver of rights, privileges, exemptions and immunities required by the United States authorities for the acquisition or retention of permanent resident status. The provision is based on a policy established in 1953 by the General Assembly that persons in permanent resident status should in future be ineligible for appointment as internationally recruited staff members unless they are prepared to change to a G-4 visa status (or equivalent status in host countries other than the United States of America). That policy was adopted because it was considered that a decision to remain in permanent resident status in no way represents an interest of the United Nations. On the contrary, to the extent (if any) that it may weaken existing ties with the country of nationality, it is an undesirable decision. 27. The general rule stated in section 5.6 does not apply in a limited number of situations, which are strictly defined in section 5.7 of the instruction. 28. The most frequent situation will arise in New York in respect of locally recruited staff members in the General Service and related categories, who are authorized to retain their permanent resident status on recruitment, or to acquire that status in the course of their service with the Organization. Those who are newly recruited will be asked to produce their alien registration card for the Office of Human Resources Management on the day they report for duty. Staff members who have already been recruited and wish to acquire that status are required to do the following: (a) Advise the Office of Human Resources Management in writing prior to making their application to the authorities of the United States; 6 ST/IC/2001/27 (b) If the application is successful, sign a waiver of rights, privileges, exemptions and immunities, as required by United States authorities. The staff member must request authorization to do so from the Office of Human Resources Management; (c) Immediately inform the Office of Human Resources Management in writing of the date of signature of the waiver and produce his or her alien registration card. 29. Acquisition of permanent resident status places staff members in a position of parity with staff who are nationals of the United States with respect to their status and entitlements in the United Nations, including home leave, education grant and repatriation grant, from the date on which they have been granted permanent resident status as shown on their alien registration card. 30. Permanent residents are subject to all applicable United States laws and are liable to pay income taxes on their United Nations earnings. They are not, however, eligible to contribute to the United States Social Security Programme and do not pay social security taxes. Staff members authorized to sign the waiver of rights, privileges, exemptions and immunities required by the United States Government become eligible to obtain tax reimbursement on their United Nations earnings under staff regulation 3.3 (f) and ST/AI/1998/1 as from the date of the signature of the waiver. For that purpose, they are required to follow the procedures contained in the information circular on payment of income taxes that is issued annually by the Controller. For former staff members after separation from service on a G-4 visa, and certain of their relatives 31. The following table provides information on some essential conditions under which former staff members previously serving on a G-4 visa, and certain of their relatives, may be allowed to change their visa status. Please note that the information is subject to change at any time by the United States authorities. 7 ST/IC/2001/27 Category Required residence and physical presence in the United States Application deadlines A. Eligible for ""special immigrant"" status: (1) Unmarried son or daughter of official on G-4 visa On a G-4 or N visa: (a)  1/2 of the 7 years before date of application; and (b) 7 years* between ages 5 and 21 25th birthday (2) Surviving spouse of deceased official formerly on G-4 visa On a G-4 or N visa: (a)  1/2 of the 7 years before date of application; and (b) 15 years* before death of official 6 months after death of official (3) Retired official formerly on G-4 visa On a G-4 visa: (a)  1/2 of the 7 years before date of application; and (b) 15 years* before date of retirement 6 months after retirement (4) Spouse of a retired official granted special immigrant status under A (3) who accompanies or follows official as member of immediate family None None B. Eligible for ""N"" category non-immigrant visa: (1) Parent of child granted special immigrant status under A (1) until child becomes 21 None None (2) Child, until age 21, of parent who is granted: -  ""N"" visa under B (1); or None None - Special immigrant status under A (2), (3) or (4) None None * These amounts are totals, and need not constitute a continuous period. 32. Neither the Office of Legal Affairs, nor the Office of Human Resources Management is staffed to provide advice or assistance as to the status of non- United States staff members, former staff members or relatives wishing to stay in the United States on a basis other than on a G-4 visa. Staff members should seek the advice of competent immigration lawyers. Section III. G-5 visas 33. The information provided below should be read in conjunction with sections 6 to 10 of ST/AI/2000/19, which contains the applicable rules. What is a G-5 visa and who is eligible for it? 34. A G-5 visa may be granted to household employees of staff members who hold a G-4 visa. This is not part of the benefits extended to staff members but a privilege granted by the host country to serve the interests of the Organization. The employment of household help under a G-5 visa is subject to the laws and 8 ST/IC/2001/27 regulations applicable to employment contracts in the United States of America and the specific state concerned. A staff member employing such household help is responsible for compliance with these laws and regulations. The United Nations will not assume any liability arising from or relating to such laws and regulations or any legal actions in connection with the employment of household help by any staff member. 35. A G-5 visa will not be granted if the prospective employee is related to the staff member or his or her spouse, or has no previous experience in domestic service. The employee should come from the same cultural background as the staff member, or have several years of documented domestic service in the staff member's household. A G-5 visa cannot be used for any other purpose for which the United States authorities grant another type of non-immigrant visa category, such as study, business, tourism or specific employment. Application for a new G-5 visa 36. A valid G-5 visa is required for the household employee to enter the United States. Staff members wishing to obtain a G-5 visa for a household employee are required to submit an application to the United Nations Visa Committee, which will provide advice to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management. 37. The staff member should obtain from the Visa Committee secretariat a complete set of application documents. A completed application consists of: (a) A signed undertaking by the staff member; (b) A request for endorsement of the G-5 visa application, with all necessary attachments; (c) A standard employment contract, to be signed by the staff member and the household employee. The contract must be in English and, if the employee does not understand English, in another language that the employee understands; (d) A signed form TTS.1* (request for United States visa). However, if the prospective employee is in the United States on another type of visa, form PT.63/B* (request for change to G-5 visa status [for household employee]) should be submitted. In those cases, the United States authorities may not consider adjustment of visa status unless the prospective employee applies from outside the United States; (e) If the staff member has previously employed a G-5 visa holder, records concerning the previous employee should be submitted as well. 38. The Visa Committee secretariat transmits endorsed requests to the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service for transmittal to the United States authorities. Obligations of the staff member employing a G-5 visa holder 39. On arrival in the United States of the household employee to whom a G-5 visa has been granted, the staff member is required to inform the Visa Committee secretariat and the Travel and Transportation Service by submitting a form entitled ""Clarification of status of household employee"", available from the Visa Committee * Available on Intranet, Quicklink ""Forms"". 9 ST/IC/2001/27 secretariat, together with a copy of the signed contract of employment, a copy of the G-5 visa and of United States Government form I-94. 40. As the household employee is subject to United States laws on taxes and social security while holding a G-5 visa, unless there is a totalization/social security agreement between the United States and the country of nationality of the household employee, staff members are required to withhold income, social security and state taxes from their household employees and to submit them, together with their own share of social security contribution, to the appropriate tax authorities. 41. Special rules regarding income tax and participation in the United States Social Security Programme apply to household employees of senior United Nations officials at the Assistant Secretary-General level and above, as a result of the provisions of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Those rules are set out in section 10 of ST/AI/2000/19. 42. All staff members are required to provide adequate health insurance coverage for their household employees. The United Nations will assume no responsibility in this regard, or in assisting staff members who have incurred medical expenses on account of their household employee. 43. Staff members employing a G-5 visa holder are required to maintain the records listed in section 6.3 of ST/AI/2000/19 for the duration of actual employment and for three years thereafter. 44. At the end of the authorized employment or on cancellation of the employee's G-5 visa, the staff member is responsible for making arrangements for the repatriation of the employee. Evidence of such repatriation, including original boarding passes or a copy of the passport of the employee stamped upon arrival in the home country, must be submitted to the United Nations Visa Committee. 45. If the household employee ceases to be employed by the staff member and is to be employed by another staff member on a G-4 visa, both staff members must inform the United Nations Visa Committee of the proposed change, as provided in section 7.3 of ST/AI/2000/19. The new prospective employer will then submit an application for G-5 visa, following the procedure set out in paragraph 37 above. Pending approval, or in the absence of approval, the responsibility to repatriate the household employee remains with the original employer. Duration of authorized stay and extension of G-5 visa 46. The duration of authorized stay is indicated in the I-94 form, which is stapled into the passport by a United States Immigration and Naturalization Service official upon the arrival in the United States of the household employee to whom a G-5 visa has been granted. Staff members are urged to review the I-94 form in their employee's passport to ensure compliance with all applicable rules. 47. If the household employee wishes to remain in the United States beyond the period authorized by the I-94 form, an extension of authorized stay must be obtained. This should be done as follows: (a) The staff member obtains from the Visa Committee secretariat United States Government form I-539 (application to extend time of temporary stay); 10 ST/IC/2001/27 (b) The staff member submits the completed form, together with the household employee's I-94 form and a certificate that the staff member still holds a G-4 visa and continues to employ the household employee; (c) The Visa Committee secretariat transmits the completed application to the Travel and Transportation Service for transmittal to the United States Mission. 48. Household employees who have overstayed the authorized period, as indicated in their I-94 form, will be obliged to leave the United States and will not be eligible to be readmitted into the United States without first having obtained a new G-5 visa in their country of nationality. United States authorities have made a limited number of exceptions to the requirement that a new G-5 visa should be obtained in the country of nationality, in particular: (a) If an application was filed on behalf of a household employee prior to the expiration date shown on the I-94 form, but was not approved by the United States authorities until after that date, the employee will not ordinarily be required to return to his or her country of nationality to obtain a new G-5 visa; (b) A G-5 visa applicant who has a current residence in a country other than that of his or her nationality or the United States will have the option to apply for his or her visa in that country; (c) G-5 applicants from a country where the United States does not have a visa-issuing post may apply in certain countries designated by the United States Department of State. Cancellation of G-5 visa 49. Staff members are required to comply strictly with the provisions of section 8 of ST/AI/2000/19 concerning the cancellation of their household employee's G-5 visa when household employment is terminated or when the staff member is no longer eligible for a G-4 visa, as will occur upon separation from service, transfer to a duty station outside the United States, or change from G-4 to another visa status. 50. The staff member is required to submit the following documentation at the latest within one week before his or her change of visa status: (a) The passport of the household employee holding the G-5 visa, so that the visa may be cancelled; (b) The employee's I-94 form. Those documents must be presented either to the United States Mission, or to the Travel and Transportation Service, which will transmit them to the United States Mission for processing. 51. Upon cancellation, the staff member is required to submit copies of the cancelled documents to the Visa Committee secretariat. 52. The staff member is responsible for making all necessary arrangements for the repatriation of a household employee whose G-5 visa has been cancelled and for submitting proof of repatriation to the Visa Committee secretariat.

"travel","  United Nations    ST/IC/2001/27        Secretariat      10 April 2001    [Consolidated text]      Information circular       Consolidated text of ST/IC/2001/27, as last amended by  ST/IC/2001/27/Amend.1 of 25 August 2008         To: Members of the staff      From: The Under-Secretary-General for Management      Subject: Visa status in the United States of America      1.  The purpose of the present circular is to provide additional information on the  conditions of application of administrative instruction ST/AI/2000/19 (Visa status of  non-United States staff members serving in the United States, members of their  household and their household employees, and staff members seeking or holding  permanent resident status in the United States). Staff members should familiarize  themselves thoroughly with the provisions of that instruction. It is available on the  Intranet, where it can be accessed under ""reference material"".  2.  Questions pertaining to G-4 visas are covered in section I of this circular  (paras. 3-25). Section II concerns questions relating to permanent resident status, in  respect of staff members at the time of recruitment or while employed (paras. 26-30)  as well as former staff members after separation from service on a G-4 visa and  certain of their relatives (paras. 31-32). Section III deals with G-5 visa questions  (paras. 34-52).        Section I. G-4 visas      What is a G-4 visa and who is eligible for it?    3.  The G-4 visa is a non-immigrant visa granted to officials or employees of  international organizations while stationed on official business in the United States  of America, as well as to members of their immediate families. The United States  authorities grant a G-4 visa in order to permit staff members who are not citizens or  permanent residents of the United States to work at United Nations Headquarters in  New York or in other locations in the United States.  4.  The immediate family of a staff member eligible for a G-4 visa include a  spouse, unmarried dependent children under the age of 21 and children for whom a      * The present circular will be in effect until further notice.    2      ST/IC/2001/27      staff member receives an education grant.  5.  Other relatives, including children who are 21 years old or older for whom the  staff member does not receive an education grant, may be eligible for a G-4 visa  when they demonstrate close ties and a continued dependency on the staff member.  It must be established that they seek entry to the United States in order to reside  with the staff member. This excludes applications that are submitted for other  purposes, such as study, the pursuit of business or employment opportunities.  Applications for a G-4 visa for relatives other than the immediate family of the staff  member are submitted to the United Nations Visa Committee, and subsequently to  the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management for approval.  6.  The Visa Committee will generally give favourable consideration to  applications by relatives previously living in the staff member's household before  coming to the United States and for parents who are over the age of 65. If the  relative was not previously living in the staff member's household, the staff member  will be required to explain the compelling reasons for which the relative would now  join his or her household. If the relative is not financially dependent on the staff  member, the staff member will be required to justify the request on other compelling  grounds, such as physical need for family care in the case of parents, or incapacity  or minority in the case of siblings.        Application for G-4 visas    7.  For staff members who are newly recruited to New York, or assigned or  transferred to New York from another duty station:    (a)  The Human Resources Officer handling the recruitment or the Executive  Officer handling the assignment or transfer prepares an application for G-4 visa(s)  for the staff member and his or her immediate family members;     (b)  The Office of Human Resources Management or the executive office  submits the application to the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service, Office  of Conference and Support Services;    (c)  The Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service issues a formal  request for issuance of a G-4 visa for the staff member and immediate family  members to the appropriate United States consular office where the visa will be  granted.  8.  For staff members already in the United States who seek conversion of a prior  visa to G-4 status for themselves or members of their immediate family:    (a)  The staff member obtains form PT.63* (request for change to G-4 visa  status) or form PT.63/A* (request for change to G-4 visa status for spouse and  family members) and submits the completed form to the Human Resources Officer;    (b)  The Office of Human Resources Management transmits the request to the  Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service for transmittal to the United States  Mission.  9.  For staff members requesting a G-4 visa for relatives other than immediate  family members:        * Available on Intranet, Quicklink ""Forms"".      3      ST/IC/2001/27      (a)  The staff member obtains form TTS.1,* and forms VC.3 and VC.4 from  the secretariat of the Visa Committee, and submits the completed forms to the  secretariat of the Committee, together with evidence of health insurance;    (b)  If the request is approved, the Visa Committee secretariat transmits  completed form TTS.1 to the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service  together with evidence of health insurance;    (c)  The Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service issues a formal  request for issuance of a G-4 visa to the United States consular office where the  applicant will appear in person;    (d)  A copy of the request is given to the staff member for transmittal to the  relative. The staff member should advise the relative to go to the United States  consular office with a valid national passport in order to obtain the visa. The relative  may not apply for, or accept, any other type of visa while awaiting issuance of a G-4  visa.        Duration of authorized stay and extension of G-4 visa    10. The duration of the G-4 visa and the number of entries granted by the United  States authorities depend on a number of factors, including the contractual status  and nationality of the visa holder.  11.  When a staff member or a family member to whom a G-4 visa has been  granted arrives in the United States, the immigration official generally records ""G-4,  D/S"" on United States Government form I-94 (permission to stay, arrival-departure  record), which is stapled into the passport. This notation establishes the G-4 visa  status as valid for as long as the staff member remains in the employ of the United  Nations and does not leave the United States.  12. However, if a specific expiration date for the G-4 visa status is recorded on  form I-94, and the staff member is required to remain on duty in the United States  beyond the specified date, the staff member must request an extension by writing a  memorandum to the Chief of the Transportation and Travel Service through his or  her executive office. Extension requests for relatives other than immediate family  members should be submitted to the Visa Committee secretariat. All requests for an  extension should be presented at least 30 working days before the expiration date  specified on the I-94 form.        Request for renewal of G-4 visa in case of travel and re-entry into the  United States    13. Before leaving the United States on official or personal travel, staff members  and their family members on a G-4 visa should make sure that the G-4 visa stamped  in their passports will still be valid on the expected date of re-entry. If not, they will  have no valid document for re-entry as the I-94 form is removed upon departure  from the United States.  14. If the G-4 visa has expired, and there are at least 15 working days before  departure from the United States, a new G-4 visa for the staff member and  immediate family members should be requested as follows:        * Available on Intranet, Quicklink, ""Forms"".    4      ST/IC/2001/27        (a)  The staff member obtains form PT.61,* completes it in duplicate and  submits it to the executive or administrative office, with the national passport or the  United Nations laissez-passer;    (b)  The executive or administrative office certifies the completed forms;    (c)  The staff member hand-delivers the completed forms, together with the  passport or laissez-passer, to the Travel and Transportation Service, which will  forward it to the United States Mission.  15. If there are less than 15 working days before departure from the United States,  a new G-4 visa for the staff member and immediate family members should be  requested as follows:    (a)  The staff member obtains form TTS.1,* completes the form, obtains  certification of the form from the executive or administrative office and submits it to  the Travel and Transportation Service;    (b)  The Travel and Transportation Service gives to the staff member a copy  of the facsimile request addressed to the appropriate United States consulate or  embassy abroad where that copy will have to be presented in order to obtain a new  G-4 visa.  16. Requests for new G-4 visas for relatives other than immediate family members  should be submitted to the Visa Committee. The Visa Committee secretariat  transmits endorsed requests to the Chief of the Travel and Transportation Service.        Expiration and cancellation of G-4 visas    17. When a staff member separates from service, goes on special leave with or  without pay, or is transferred to a duty station outside the United States, his or her  right to stay in the United States expires automatically, even if the G-4 visa stamped  in the passport shows a date of validity beyond the date of separation or transfer.  The same applies to family members whose G-4 visa status is derivative from the  status of the staff member.  18. Staff members are required to comply strictly with the procedure set out in  section 3 of ST/AI/2000/19 for cancellation of G-4 visas for themselves and their  family members prior to the effective date of their separation from service, special  leave or transfer. This must be done, at the latest, one week prior to that date. Visas  that have already expired do not have to be cancelled under that procedure.  19. Staff members who have obtained a G-4 visa for a spouse from whom they are  subsequently divorced are required to follow the procedure prescribed in section 3.3  of ST/AI/2000/19.  20. During the exit interview required before departure, staff members will be  requested to confirm that they have followed the visa cancellation procedures and  provide a photocopy of the cancelled or expired visas.  21. In practice, United States authorities allow staff members and their families   30 days to leave the country or adjust their status after the date of expiration of their  G-4 visa. If additional time is required, the staff member should contact the Office  of Host Country Affairs at the United States Mission without delay.        * Available on Intranet, Quicklink ""Forms"".      5      ST/IC/2001/27    22. In the event of the death in service of a staff member with G-4 status, the Staff  Counsellor may be contacted for guidance in requesting extension of the normal 30- day period for surviving family members who are on derivative G-4 visas.  Permission to work for holders of derivative G-4 visas  23. Employment of spouses and dependent children who are on derivative G-4  visas is generally authorized, within certain limitations. Employment is not  authorized for other relatives who may also have a derivative G-4 visa. Unmarried  children who are less than 23 years old and are full-time students seeking to work  part time during the academic year, or full time during school holidays, are normally  authorized to do so without limitations. Children on G-4 visas who have reached  their twenty-third birthday will not be authorized to work unless they are physically  or mentally disabled.  24. The necessary information and forms to seek authorization to work may be  obtained from the Staff Counsellor's office. Requests for permission to accept  employment must be submitted by staff members to the Staff Counsellor's office,  which will review them for accuracy and completeness. The Staff Counsellor's  office will in turn forward the requests to the United States Immigration and  Naturalization Service through the United States Mission. Once an Employment  Authorization Document (EAD) is issued, staff members will be notified to retrieve  the employment authorization card from the Staff Counsellor's office. Permission is  required before employment begins. It may be granted for a maximum period of  three years and may be renewed. A new request must be submitted upon each  change of employment.  25. All income earned in the United States by holders of derivative G-4 visas is  subject to income and social security taxes.        Section II. Permanent resident status  For staff members at the time of recruitment or while employed  26. Under section 5.6 of ST/AI/2000/19, non-United States citizens who have  permanent resident status in the United States are required to renounce such status  and to change to G-4 visa status upon appointment. The same rule provides that staff  members who seek to change to permanent resident status will not be granted  permission to sign the waiver of rights, privileges, exemptions and immunities  required by the United States authorities for the acquisition or retention of  permanent resident status. The provision is based on a policy established in 1953 by  the General Assembly that persons in permanent resident status should in future be  ineligible for appointment as internationally recruited staff members unless they are  prepared to change to a G-4 visa status (or equivalent status in host countries other  than the United States of America). That policy was adopted because it was  considered that a decision to remain in permanent resident status in no way  represents an interest of the United Nations. On the contrary, to the extent (if any)  that it may weaken existing ties with the country of nationality, it is an undesirable  decision.  27. The general rule stated in section 5.6 does not apply in a limited number of  situations, which are strictly defined in section 5.7 of the instruction.  28. The most frequent situation will arise in New York in respect of locally  recruited staff members in the General Service and related categories, who are    6      ST/IC/2001/27      authorized to retain their permanent resident status on recruitment, or to acquire that  status in the course of their service with the Organization. Those who are newly  recruited will be asked to produce their alien registration card for the Office of  Human Resources Management on the day they report for duty. Staff members who  have already been recruited and wish to acquire that status are required to do the  following:    (a)  Advise the Office of Human Resources Management in writing prior to  making their application to the authorities of the United States;    (b)  If the application is successful, sign a waiver of rights, privileges,  exemptions and immunities, as required by United States authorities. The staff  member must request authorization to do so from the Office of Human Resources  Management;    (c)  Immediately inform the Office of Human Resources Management in  writing of the date of signature of the waiver and produce his or her alien  registration card.  29. Acquisition of permanent resident status places staff members in a position of  parity with staff who are nationals of the United States with respect to their status  and entitlements in the United Nations, including home leave, education grant and  repatriation grant, from the date on which they have been granted permanent  resident status as shown on their alien registration card.  30. Permanent residents are subject to all applicable United States laws and are  liable to pay income taxes on their United Nations earnings. They are not, however,  eligible to contribute to the United States Social Security Programme and do not pay  social security taxes. Staff members authorized to sign the waiver of rights,  privileges, exemptions and immunities required by the United States Government  become eligible to obtain tax reimbursement on their United Nations earnings under  staff regulation 3.3 (f) and ST/AI/1998/1 as from the date of the signature of the  waiver. For that purpose, they are required to follow the procedures contained in the  information circular on payment of income taxes that is issued annually by the  Controller.        For former staff members after separation from service on a G-4 visa, and  certain of their relatives    31. The following table provides information on some essential conditions under  which former staff members previously serving on a G-4 visa, and certain of their  relatives, may be allowed to change their visa status. Please note that the  information is subject to change at any time by the United States authorities.      7      ST/IC/2001/27      Category  Required residence and physical presence   in the United States  Application deadlines        A. Eligible for ""special immigrant"" status:      (1) Unmarried son or daughter of  official on G-4 visa  On a G-4 or N visa:  (a)  1/2 of the 7 years before date of  application; and  (b) 7 years* between ages 5 and 21  25th birthday    (2) Surviving spouse of deceased  official formerly on G-4 visa  On a G-4 or N visa:  (a)  1/2 of the 7 years before date of  application; and   (b) 15 years* before death of official  6 months after death  of official    (3) Retired official formerly on G-4  visa  On a G-4 visa:  (a)  1/2 of the 7 years before date of  application; and  (b) 15 years* before date of retirement  6 months after  retirement    (4) Spouse of a retired official granted  special immigrant status under   A (3) who accompanies or follows  official as member of immediate  family  None  None  B. Eligible for ""N"" category non-immigrant visa:    (1) Parent of child granted special  immigrant status under A (1) until  child becomes 21  None  None    (2) Child, until age 21, of parent who is  granted:          -  ""N"" visa under B (1); or  None  None      -  Special immigrant status under  A (2), (3) or (4)  None  None     * These amounts are totals, and need not constitute a continuous period.      32. Neither the Office of Legal Affairs, nor the Office of Human Resources  Management is staffed to provide advice or assistance as to the status of non- United States staff members, former staff members or relatives wishing to stay  in the United States on a basis other than on a G-4 visa. Staff members should  seek the advice of competent immigration lawyers.         Section III. G-5 visas    33. The information provided below should be read in conjunction with sections 6  to 10 of  ST/AI/2000/19, which contains the applicable rules.        What is a G-5 visa and who is eligible for it?    34. A G-5 visa may be granted to household employees of staff members who hold  a G-4 visa. This is not part of the benefits extended to staff members but a privilege  granted by the host country to serve the interests of the Organization. The  employment of household help under a G-5 visa is subject to the laws and    8      ST/IC/2001/27      regulations applicable to employment contracts in the United States of America and  the specific state concerned. A staff member employing such household help is  responsible for compliance with these laws and regulations. The United Nations will  not assume any liability arising from or relating to such laws and regulations or any  legal actions in connection with the employment of household help by any staff  member.  35. A G-5 visa will not be granted if the prospective employee is related to the  staff member or his or her spouse, or has no previous experience in domestic  service. The employee should come from the same cultural background as the staff  member, or have several years of documented domestic service in the staff  member's household. A G-5 visa cannot be used for any other purpose for which the  United States authorities grant another type of non-immigrant visa category, such as  study, business, tourism or specific employment.        Application for a new G-5 visa    36. A valid G-5 visa is required for the household employee to enter the United  States. Staff members wishing to obtain a G-5 visa for a household employee are  required to submit an application to the United Nations Visa Committee, which will  provide advice to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources  Management.  37. The staff member should obtain from the Visa Committee secretariat a  complete set of application documents. A completed application consists of:     (a)  A signed undertaking by the staff member;     (b)  A request for endorsement of the G-5 visa application, with all necessary  attachments;    (c)  A standard employment contract, to be signed by the staff member and  the household employee. The contract must be in English and, if the employee does  not understand English, in another language that the employee understands;    (d)  A signed form TTS.1* (request for United States visa). However, if the  prospective employee is in the United States on another type of visa, form PT.63/B*  (request for change to G-5 visa status [for household employee]) should be  submitted. In those cases, the United States authorities may not consider adjustment  of visa status unless the prospective employee applies from outside the United  States;    (e)  If the staff member has previously employed a G-5 visa holder, records  concerning the previous employee should be submitted as well.  38. The Visa Committee secretariat transmits endorsed requests to the Chief of the  Travel and Transportation Service for transmittal to the United States authorities.         Obligations of the staff member employing a G-5 visa holder    39. On arrival in the United States of the household employee to whom a G-5 visa  has been granted, the staff member is required to inform the Visa Committee  secretariat and the Travel and Transportation Service by submitting a form entitled  ""Clarification of status of household employee"", available from the Visa Committee        * Available on Intranet, Quicklink ""Forms"".      9      ST/IC/2001/27    secretariat, together with a copy of the signed contract of employment, a copy of the  G-5 visa and of United States Government form I-94.  40. As the household employee is subject to United States laws on taxes and social  security while holding a G-5 visa, unless there is a totalization/social security  agreement between the United States and the country of nationality of the household  employee, staff members are required to withhold income, social security and state  taxes from their household employees and to submit them, together with their own  share of social security contribution, to the appropriate tax authorities.  41. Special rules regarding income tax and participation in the United States  Social Security Programme apply to household employees of senior United Nations  officials at the Assistant Secretary-General level and above, as a result of the  provisions of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United  Nations and of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Those rules are set  out in section 10 of ST/AI/2000/19.  42. All staff members are required to provide adequate health insurance coverage  for their household employees. The United Nations will assume no responsibility in  this regard, or in assisting staff members who have incurred medical expenses on  account of their household employee.   43. Staff members employing a G-5 visa holder are required to maintain the  records listed in section 6.3 of ST/AI/2000/19 for the duration of actual  employment and for three years thereafter.  44. At the end of the authorized employment or on cancellation of the employee's  G-5 visa, the staff member is responsible for making arrangements for the  repatriation of the employee. Evidence of such repatriation, including original  boarding passes or a copy of the passport of the employee stamped upon arrival in  the home country, must be submitted to the United Nations Visa Committee.  45. If the household employee ceases to be employed by the staff member and is  to be employed by another staff member on a G-4 visa, both staff members must  inform the United Nations Visa Committee of the proposed change, as provided in  section 7.3 of ST/AI/2000/19. The new prospective employer will then submit an  application for G-5 visa, following the procedure set out in paragraph 37 above.  Pending approval, or in the absence of approval, the responsibility to repatriate the  household employee remains with the original employer.    Duration of authorized stay and extension of G-5 visa  46. The duration of authorized stay is indicated in the I-94 form, which is stapled  into the passport by a United States Immigration and Naturalization Service official  upon the arrival in the United States of the household employee to whom a G-5 visa  has been granted. Staff members are urged to review the I-94 form in their  employee's passport to ensure compliance with all applicable rules.  47. If the household employee wishes to remain in the United States beyond the  period authorized by the I-94 form, an extension of authorized stay must be  obtained. This should be done as follows:     (a)  The staff member obtains from the Visa Committee secretariat United  States Government form I-539 (application to extend time of temporary stay);    10      ST/IC/2001/27        (b)  The staff member submits the completed form, together with the  household employee's I-94 form and a certificate that the staff member still holds a  G-4 visa and continues to employ the household employee;    (c)  The Visa Committee secretariat transmits the completed application to  the Travel and Transportation Service for transmittal to the United States Mission.  48. Household employees who have overstayed the authorized period, as indicated  in their I-94 form, will be obliged to leave the United States and will not be eligible  to be readmitted into the United States without first having obtained a new G-5 visa  in their country of nationality. United States authorities have made a limited number  of exceptions to the requirement that a new G-5 visa should be obtained in the  country of nationality, in particular:    (a)  If an application was filed on behalf of a household employee prior to the  expiration date shown on the I-94 form, but was not approved by the United States  authorities until after that date, the employee will not ordinarily be required to  return to his or her country of nationality to obtain a new G-5 visa;    (b)  A G-5 visa applicant who has a current residence in a country other than  that of his or her nationality or the United States will have the option to apply for  his or her visa in that country;    (c)  G-5 applicants from a country where the United States does not have a  visa-issuing post may apply in certain countries designated by the United States  Department of State.    Cancellation of G-5 visa  49. Staff members are required to comply strictly with the provisions of section 8  of ST/AI/2000/19 concerning the cancellation of their household employee's G-5  visa when household employment is terminated or when the staff member is no  longer eligible for a G-4 visa, as will occur upon separation from service, transfer to  a duty station outside the United States, or change from G-4 to another visa status.  50. The staff member is required to submit the following documentation at the  latest within one week before his or her change of visa status:    (a)  The passport of the household employee holding the G-5 visa, so that the  visa may be cancelled;    (b)  The employee's I-94 form.  Those documents must be presented either to the United States Mission, or to the  Travel and Transportation Service, which will transmit them to the United States  Mission for processing.  51. Upon cancellation, the staff member is required to submit copies of the  cancelled documents to the Visa Committee secretariat.  52. The staff member is responsible for making all necessary arrangements for the  repatriation of a household employee whose G-5 visa has been cancelled and for  submitting proof of repatriation to the Visa Committee secretariat.
